    "text": "Throughout my life it has been proven to me time and again that health is truly the most important thing in a person's life. Without our health and livelihood, it becomes impossible to enjoy other very important things in our lives such as family, friends, our work, etc. Physicians have always been heroic figures to me because of the fact that they devote their lives to helping people recover their health in the face of illnesses, disabilities, and diseases, so that they may once again lead a fulfilling life. Even as a young child I dreamed of one day becoming a doctor and doing whatever I could to help sick people become well. Of course, I also wanted to be a major league baseball player and an astronaut. As I grew up I realized that doing all three of these at once would be impossible, but I also became more and more drawn toward the medical field. Many different life experiences have led me down this path but two in particular stick out very clearly in my mind. During my junior year of high school a classmate of mine named Andy died after a short and terrible battle with cancer. As I stood at his funeral I thought about how just over a month before that he believed he had a clean bill of health and was standing in the same shoes that I was. He was young, intelligent, ambitious, and had the entire world waiting right there in front of him. Then, he was gone forever. I realized that any of us could be gone tomorrow and that if we have goals we need to work every day and do our best to achieve them. However, while tragedies like what happened to Andy occur, some amazing success stories have inspired me as well. My grandfather, for example, has had prostate cancer for over twenty years, but has been able to live a relatively healthy lifestyle because of the outstanding treatments he has received. The quick actions of the physicians and the incredible medical technologies used to save my grandpa show me how these doctors are able to literally give someone their life back when without them they would have passed away. Also, the great strength of the physicians in Andy's case inspires me to want to be a part of what they do. For them to fight a furious battle to save this kid and still be able to move on and keep working even when faced with losing that battle shows me what amazing people they must be. It is clearly a very challenging job but also a very rewarding one. I have come to the realization that only the best of the best can possibly survive in this career and I believe that I have what it takes to do it. I have been inspired by these experiences to work as hard as possible to do what it takes to reach my goal of becoming a physician. I want to be someone that can help a young kid in his fight against cancer. And even if one battle is lost, I want to be someone who is strong enough to move on and help the next kid in this fight. Also, if by practicing medicine I can give some other kid and his grandpa the chance to get to know and love each other the way my grandpa and I do by keeping the grandpa healthy, then I definitely want in. I know it takes a lot of strength, passion, and talent to be a part of this field and to have the chance to give people back the health that is of ultimate importance to them. But I believe that I have what it takes to be able to do that and I will not stop working until I am in a position to help people in this way. Elder High School Before and after school at Elder High School I would tutor younger students in a wide variety of subjects., Bethany House Bethany House is a shelter for homeless women and children. I have done several different things there. In the very beginning I actually babysat some of the children at night so that the moms could go out and do things such as shop, look for jobs, etc. Recently I have done more special events volunteering for things such as their annual children's carnival, the christmas party, and the Mardi Gras fundraiser, BBB Biological Honor Society I have taken part in the meetings and activities of the Rho Theta chapter of the BBB Biological Honor Society at Thomas More College., Kiwanis Club I have worked as a special events volunteer for the Kiwanis Club in activities that involve physically and/or mentally disabled adults and children at the events. These events include things such as trips to area attractions and a fishing derby., Kemba Credit Union I have worked at Kemba for 6 years, first as a member service representative in the call center and then as a bank teller. I was 15 when I was hired and have stayed with the company for the past six years allowing me to gain valuable experience working with people and working in the area of customer service. I mostly have worked in the Summer but have always stayed and worked at least a couple days a week during the school year as well., Dean's Highest Honors-Thomas More College I received Dean's Highest Honors every semester that I've been in college., Science Fair Judge I was a science fair judge for a 6th-8th grade science fair at Immaculate Heart of Mary grade school. This consisted of viewing their presentations/experiments, asking them questions and interacting with them, and grading their projects., Spokesman for dual credit program at Thomas More College I was chosen by professors at Thomas More College to be the student spokesman for the dual credit program. The dual credit program is a program in which I took part where high school seniors can take classes that count for real college credit. I spoke at a banquet for college professors and high school teachers and administrators to tell them about the advantages of the program and how it benefits the students. I will continue to do things like this for this program in the future as well., Lab Aide for Developmental Neurology Lab This lab was in the developmental biology lab at Cincinnati Children's hospital and was specifically a neurology lab that was studying the AWC neuron in C. Elegans. My work in this lab consisted of lab aide work such as preparing solutions and worm plates for the lab as well as picking and transferring worms for the experiments. I worked under two post-doctorate lab members and a graduate student as well as the PI. I would assist them as needed with their experiments and often listen to explanations of their experiments in order to stay informed about  everything that was going on in the lab."

    "text": "When I was in eighth grade, I had a personal medical experience that ignited my passion to pursue a career in medicine.  It was two weeks before my mother was set to go on a European cruise when she was unexpectedly hospitalized.  After a long night of sharp pains in her abdomen, she checked into the emergency room where they began the usual arsenal of tests.  Nothing appeared to be wrong, but the pain persisted.  After all the noninvasive tests came back negative, the doctors decided they had no other choice but to perform exploratory surgery.  Doctors promptly found the problem--an out pocketing of the duodenum that had ruptured.  It was something that affected an exceptionally small number of people and if left untreated for much longer would have resulted in death.  It was through this experience that I recognized the profound affect a physician could have on a patient's life.  The issue of life and death decisions became personal, and I wanted to be part of the solution.  This one event transformed my will to become a doctor from a fleeting childish dream to a lasting desire of my heart.       Due to this aspiration, I pursued Zoology in college.  I am a true proponent that one should use his or her talents and abilities to their fullest.  I discovered I had a love of the sciences, and have since shown myself that through hard work I can excel in these subjects.  As I delve deeper and deeper into my study of biology, I am fascinated by the complexity of the mechanisms of life, and the delicate balance that holds them all together.  I love to learn, and it is very important to me to have a career in which I have a mastery over a subject and continue the process of life long learning.  Besides constantly expanding my knowledge base, I have a desire to make a difference in peoples' lives.       This yearning, to make a difference, is why I have joined Kappa Phi, a Christian women's club.  Kappa Phi has given me an avenue to build into girls spiritually and into the community through service.  One way that I have been able to do this is through my involvement in Relay for Life, which raises money for cancer.  Relay gave me an opportunity to demonstrate my skills as a leader as well as the chance to raise awareness of and support for cancer, something that has personally touched my life.  In addition, through my role as service chair, I have been able to lead various activities that influenced people throughout the community.       As a productive outlet for my aspiration to serve others, I have spent time each week since the beginning of sophomore year volunteering at McCullough Hyde Memorial Hospital, Oxford Ohio.  I have gained valuable insight talking with the nurses and technicians.  My time in the radiology department gave me a behind the scenes peak at the non-patient side of health care.  This time also increased my comfort level in the hospital setting.  Junior year, my focus shifted to patient care.  I volunteered in the emergency room where my primary duty was the transport of patients to departments throughout the hospital.  This experience firmed my aspiration to be part of patient-interactive care.  Being able to interact directly with patients on a personal level is very fulfilling, and the opportunity to work as a partner with patients towards their rehabilitation is something I trust will be tremendously gratifying.       Over Christmas break 2004, I had the opportunity to job shadow Dr. Phil Rubio, Head of Pulmonary Medicine at Kettering Memorial Hospital, Kettering Ohio.  This experience allowed me to see the days of a private practice physician along with a hospital physician.  I gained priceless experience through this shadowing and desire to have a longer and more in depth job shadowing experience.  In order to learn more about the daily life of a practicing physician I participated in a weeklong preceptorship program during spring break 2005.  Throughout the week I followed obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Charles Watson, D.O.  His schedule consisted of approximately four hours a day of routine office visits with patients varying from pregnancies to biopsies and pap smears.  Almost all patient interaction was dictated over the phone or into a tape recorder, which interestedly showed the effect of increasing technology in the office setting.  My preceptorship with Dr. Watson presented me with the opportunity to observe two hysterectomies and an emergency C-section.  The part of the preceptorship that had the greatest impact on my drive to be a physician was these surgeries.  My most significant concern surrounding by ability to be physician was that I would not be able to handle graphic nature of surgery.  Contrary to my preconceived notion, I was filled with adrenaline as the patients underwent the procedures.  Afterwards, I felt incredibly empowered and eager to learn how to use medicine to transform patients' lives.        In conclusion, I want to be a physician because it blends my academic ability and desire to work with people towards improving health.  Additionally, I believe the constant learning process, which is necessary to keep up to date, will be intellectually fulfilling.  These elements will combine to produce a rewarding career.

Throughout the week I followed obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Charles Watson, D.O.  His schedule consisted of approximately four hours a day of routine office visits with patients varying from pregnancies to biopsies and pap smears.  My preceptorship with Dr. Watson presented me with the opportunity to observe two hysterectomies and an emergency C-section.  I was also able to discuss some of the current issues in obstetrics and gynecology. This experience left me feeling incredibly empowered and eager to learn how to use medicine to transform patients' lives., Physician Shadowing I observed Dr. Rubio, head of Pulmonary Medicine at Kettering Hospital, both in his private practice as well as in the hospital setting for one full day.  I saw how he interacted with patients and their families along with the residents that he was in charge of.  In addition, I learned how he manages his day and the process for prioritizing and dividing patients between doctors., ACS Standandized Organic Chemistry Final I ranked in 100th percentile on ACS (American Chemical Society) standardized organic chemistry final.  This test, which covers both semesters of organic chemistry, is given at schools throughout the country, and I scored higher than any of the 3,000 students polled to determine the scoring., Ferco Tech Corporation I work as special projects coordinator in Human Resources and Accounting during my breaks away from school.  Some of the projects I have completed include a total revision of the employee handbook and assisting in the creation of new attendance policies.

Junior year I held the Service Chair with the responsibility to plan and execute all service events including biweekly service where we visited The Knolls nursing home, cooking large group meals for Ronald McDonald House families, planning and implementing a Service Week, a Thanksgiving food drive, and Christmas gifts for the children of Clubhouse. Senior year, I will hold Fellowship Chair which organizes the food for all necessary events.  My involvement in Kappa Phi has given me the opportunity to grow my social and leadership skills., J. A. Culler Physics Prize This accolade is given to student to demonstrate outstanding performance in physics.  I received this award for my effort in Physics 172 and 173 after a recommendation by my professor Dr. Jennifer Blue.  The award consisted of $50 and a book of my choice in the field of physics., Relay for Life Through Kappa Phi I have participated in Relay for Life for the past three years.  In 2003 I was a team participant which involved raising, money, painting the team banner, taking shifts walking and helping with the campsite setup and cleanup.  I took on the role as team captain in 2004 and co-captain in 2005.  The role as team captain included the responsibility of attending planning meetings, collecting money, and organizing the campsite and fundraising.  My decision to be co-captain was due to the timing of Relay and the MCAT, which were only one week apart.  Particpating as a team captain took about 20-40 hours both years spread out over the 2 months before the event., McCullough Hyde Memorial Hospital Throughout my sophomore year, I volunteered as a radiology aide 4 hours a week whose duties included processing all of the film, refilling film cartridges, and filing.  I was able to interact with the technicians and experience the medical field from a different perspective.  Throughout my junior year, I volunteered as an emergency department aid 2 hours a week.  There my primary duties where cleaning rooms and transporting patients giving me the opportunity to interact with the nursing staff along with patients.  Senior year I will continue volunteering as an emergency department aid for between 2-4 hours a week."

    "text": "I am ten. We're at Grandma's for the holidays. I don't get to see her often, but she always finds time to chat with me when we visit. Grandma makes me sit on her lap when we talk, and asks, as she always does, what I want to be when I grow up. Last year, I wanted to be a trash man; I like how they get to hang onto the truck as it goes down the street. This year, though, I think I want to be a doctor, like the ones at my grandpa's hospital. Grandma smiles and says that one day I can help people who are sick like Grandpa, who has lung cancer. I like that. When I grow up, I want to be a doctor.  The idea first crossed my mind at an early age, but back then, I could hardly have grasped the extent of what it means to be a doctor. However, in recent years, I have taken opportunities to explore that dream with a greater sense of purpose and reality through my encounters with clinical medicine and scientific research; it has been these experiences that have most influenced me to pursue medicine and shaped the way I hope to practice in the future.  One of my early experiences was volunteering in the hospital, where my initial duties included some tasks that seemed unrelated to medicine. On one shift, I was asked to feed an elderly patient in the unit. Inside the room, a tiny lady buried under her sheets confessed she was not hungry, but agreed to eat her mashed potatoes if I stayed to talk. Over the next hour, I learned she had been a journalist for the L.A. Times, a collector of clocks, and a patient whose illness had taken her to four other hospitals. She also hated potatoes. She asked me why I volunteered, and I told her I wanted to experience patient-care to see if I would like to be a doctor. I also admitted that I had hoped to do more medically-related work than I was doing. As we spoke, she said her experiences had shown her that the best physicians are those who understand patient-care can encompass more than medicine. She reminded me that if I learned to truly care for patients now, even just by listening to them, the knowledge I gained in medicine would only help me to do a better job. I later had the chance to rotate throughout the hospital and was able to observe a variety of medical procedures, including intubations, deliveries, and even the treatment of a patient with a necrotic bacterial infection, but one of my greatest lessons came from an old lady who reminded me that even with a heart for medicine, my work in the future will have little meaning without a heart for people. That experience strengthened in me an attitude of humility and compassion as I continued to learn real-world medical applications of the science that fascinated me in the classroom.  Following a growing passion for healthcare, I found myself journeying thousands of miles from home to the Hospitals of Hope clinic in Bolivia. The time I spent as a medical volunteer there had a significant impact on my desire to pursue medicine, because it allowed me to experience it in a very raw and tangible way. In the small, rural community we served, medical care was hard to come by, and patients came in with anything from dermal infections to tuberculosis. As I assisted during consultations and hospital visits, I witnessed how diseases and treatments can manifest differently in each person, how health can be affected by culture and environment, and how an understanding of people can be vital to an understanding of medicine. I also realized that one responsibility of a physician is to teach; since some of the patients lived far from the clinic and were unable to see us regularly, it was important to teach them healthy habits. Through example and instruction, the doctors in Bolivia showed me how medicine, though highly scientific, was still a very personal practice.  While fostering an aspiration to be involved in medicine and patient-care, I have also continued supporting a commitment to life-long learning and a desire to participate in the advancement of science and healthcare. One way I approached this is through scientific research, first at UCLA, then more recently in the Department of Psychiatry at UCSD. Through research, I was able to develop my critical thinking skills and my personal interest in science, as well as to make a contribution to the field of Psychiatry as second author of a publication in the Public Library of Science. My experiences have shown me that my continued involvement in research activities and exposure to medical education and training will allow me to not only grow in knowledge, but increasingly contribute to the scientific and healthcare communities as I pursue medicine.  Thinking back on those conversations with my grandmother, I am reminded how some dreams fade with time and understanding. I realize now that medicine is not that kind of dream. Rather, it is an ambition that has been reinforced and refined by the reality of my experiences. Having kindled my passion for science and instilled in me a strong sense of compassion for humanity, those experiences have brought depth and clarity to my desire to enter healthcare, given me a more accurate understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a physician, and developed qualities in me that I believe will help me become an exceptional doctor. Taiwanese Presbyterian Church of San Diego As a member of the San Diego Taiwanese Presbyterian Church since childhood, I have participated and served at the church in many different ways. I play the piano, guitar, and the drums as the worship leader of the praise band and serve as a translator for joint Taiwanese/English worship services. Currently I am an adviser for the youth group; I help to coordinate a wide variety of activities, including Bible studies, worship services, outreach rallies, and retreats. My involvement at this church has helped me to develop a strong sense of commitment and allowed me to practice effective leadership skills., Applied Molecular Evolution As Laboratory Manager at Applied Molecular Evolution, my responsibilities included the preparation of media and buffer solutions for research purposes and the coordination of laboratory operations and activities, from equipment and vendor contracts to laboratory space and supplies. This position  helped me to develop my organizational and leadership skills as I maintained detailed records of laboratory activities and worked cooperatively with scientists, safety consultants, and other staff to facilitate laboratory operations., Edboost Learning Center - Tutoring At the Edboost Learning Center, I tutored students from grades K-12  in all subject areas (including Math, Science, History, and English). Tutoring sessions included both one-on-one subject tutoring as well as group homework assistance., Care Extenders Internship Program At the UCLA Santa Monica Medical Center, I participated as a part of the Care Extenders Program as an intern. I worked rotations in each of the following units: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Labor & Delivery, Critical Care Unit. I helped nurses and doctors with patient care, in-/out-patient transfers, and the delivery of lab specimens, medication, and equipment. I had the chance to observe C-sections and vaginal births among other medical procedures. Volunteering in various units in the hospital allowed me to become familiar with the hospital environment and a taught me how to care for and interact with different types of patients., InVivoScribe I am currently working in the Research and Development at InVivoScribe Technologies, which provides diagnostic products for clinical and laboratory use. My research focuses on the development of real-time quantitative assays specific for the BCR/ABL gene, which is a fusion-gene associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Under the supervision of Dr. Ying Huang, I plan, execute, and troubleshoot experimental procedures, analyze data, and present results in weekly meetings., Bolivia Medical Missions I volunteered abroad at a small medical clinic in Bolivia, which was run by Hospitals of Hope, an organization that focuses on providing medical care to people in underserved locations around the world.  In Bolivia, I worked very closely with doctors and nurses daily, serving underprivileged patients in a rural community. Most of our patients had little or no access to medical care, so I was able to observe and learn about all sorts of medical cases, from the manifestation of Chaga's disease, which is only found in certain parts of Latin America, to Tuberculosis, which is still prevalent in Bolivia. As I shadowed and assisted doctors during patient consultations, I learned how to diagnose and treat various medical conditions and how to approach medical care in the context of environment and culture. In addition, I gained valuable first-hand experience in reading vital signs, cleaning and dressing wounds, extracting blood, and administering injections and PPD skin tests. I was also able to assist doctors during such procedures as Pap smear analyses, surgeries, and deliveries. Interaction with hospital staff and patients helped me to improve my understanding patient-care while first-hand exposure to the practice of medicine helped to increase my knowledge of and interest in health-care., UCLA Asian American Tutorial Program I volunteered for 11 weeks tutoring/mentoring third-grade students in China Town with the Asian-American Tutorial Program. We tutored the students in Math and English, chaperoned field trips to museums and college campuses, and organized special holiday events for the students., UCSD - Psychiatry I was actively involved in two different research projects. The first project focused on glucocorticoid receptor and DNA interactions in the context of Major Depressive Disorder and HIV. Working independently to plan, execute, and troubleshoot experimental procedures, I demonstrated my ability to learn quickly as well as my critical thinking and organizational skills. My second project involved morphometric image analysis of MR-GEF staining in brain sections from patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. I was the second author of the manuscript which is published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS One)., MR-GEF Publication I was involved in this image analysis/morphometry project while I was in the Department of Psychiatry at UCSD, under the supervision of Dr. Gursharan Chana. Done in collaboration with Dr. Brenda Williams at the Institute of Psychiatry, the project investigated the distribution of MR-GEF, a protein that plays a role in signaling during neuronal development. We examined variable distribution between different cortical layers and between normal patients and those diagnosed with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or schizophrenia. I was also involved in the construction of the manuscript and was listed as the second author when it was published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS One)., Taiwan Missions In the summer of 2006, I was asked to lead a team of four missionaries to Tainan, Taiwan to teach English for a summer camp held by the Evangelical Formosan Church of Tainan. For four weeks, I instructed a class of twenty elementary school students, creating my own material and curriculum. As the team leader, I handled a majority of the logistical issues with our host church concerning our team finances and the organization of the camp (setting up schedules, classes, a curriculum, and activities). The experience included a great deal of contact with church workers, parents, teaching assistants, students, and teammates, so I was able to hone my communication and leadership skills.,  Research,  Research, Evangelical Formosan Church of Los Angeles While living in Los Angeles, I was an active member of the Evangelical Formosan Church of Los Angeles, where I participated and served in a variety of areas. With the worship ministry, I played drums and guitar in the praise band. In addition, I was a teacher in the children's ministry, teaching Sunday school for the pre-kinder age group; Teaching Sunday school often included preparing arts and crafts, games, bible lessons, and stories for the children. Finally, I also served as a core leader for the college fellowship; responsibilities included organizing and activities and events. My involvement in various ministries in the church allowed me to better understand my strengths and weaknesses in practical ways and helped me to develop my leadership and interpersonal skills., UCLA - Rheumatology/Medicine Working at the UCLA Rheumatology Department under Dr. Pojen P. Chen, I helped with research on auto-immune antibodies using biochemical protein affinity assays (ELISA), viral phage amplification and titers, inoculation of bacteria, DNA extraction from animal tissue, Polymerase Chain Reaction amplification (PCR), and gel electrophoresis. I also helped with lab maintenance, which included filing, data input, product ordering, dish-washing, autoclaving, and preparing the stock supply of reagent/buffer solutions. In July of 2005, I undertook a project, the basis of which was that individual clones taken from genetically engineered phage libraries can be tested for their binding affinity to CL15, an antibody that is characteristic of a Lupus-related disease, Anti-phospholipid Syndrome (APS). Those clones with the highest affinities (the ones that best mimic the structure of the CL15 antigen) are sequenced to determine a consensus in their DNA that can later be used to engineer proteins that will help to diagnose the presence of the CL15 antibody, and thus APS, in a clinical setting.  A vital part of this experience was the opportunity to see how the scientific knowledge from the classroom and the lab fit together to solve real-world problems, which gives purpose and meaning to both my work and my studies."

    "text": "The warm sun is rising, birds are chirping, and the temperature is climbing.  The summer months are here and to the average college student, this means that it is time for things to slow down.  This is not so in my case; but then again, I have never been the average college student.  To most, the arrival of summer signifies an end to a hectic school year, whereas for myself, it only means turning in the textbooks and essays for a lab coat and latex gloves.  When I first entered college, I never would have imagined my life being so full of things to do.  During the school year, the majority of my time is spent within the confines of the science building on campus.  At Capital University, my course load is nothing short of strenuous.  With a major in Biology, and striving towards minors in Chemistry, Mathematics and Computational Science, it all but impossible for me to get away with anything short of a full eighteen hour semester.  Balancing this hectic schedule may seem manageable, but my academic year also consists of involvement in collegiate athletics as well.  Playing soccer at the college level is comparable to holding down a part time job, especially while acting as team captain.  An activity filled school year does more than merely stimulate the mind.  Balancing such a chaotic schedule has forced me to understand and master time management techniques as well as how to enjoy all aspects of college life while keeping my sanity. \tEnjoying all parts of my college life has included taking advantage of some very unique travel opportunities.  For the past two years, I have spent spring break in the Central American country of Costa Rica.  While in Costa Rica, I visited the small, indigenous, BriBri Indian village of Yorkin.  Here, I was reminded of the simple pleasures of life.  While spending nearly a week with a group a people who live with no electricity or running water, I was amazed at their happiness and willingness to share their lives with us.  On the first trip, our group was accompanied by several registered nurses, who helped us deliver several boxes of medical supplies.  During the visit to the village, we administered physicals to the locals and it was simply incredible to see the looks on these people's face.  The children were the most fascinating to observe, especially Eduardo, a boy of ten-years-old.  As I used the stethoscope, he looked up at me with captivating eyes.  In Spanish, I said to him, corazon, which means heart.  I let him listen and he could not believe what he was hearing. He then looked up and smiled at me.  In the spring of my junior year, I returned to the small village of Yorkin, and again saw Eduardo.  He recognized me from the previous year, and invited me to join them in a game of futbol.  It was a surprise to me that I had impacted him enough that he would remember me a year later.  When we were finished playing, Eduardo gave me an anklet made of plastic beads, and to this day I still wear it.  When I embarked on my journey to Costa Rica, I had no idea that it would have such an impact on me.  Seeing how people with so little could be so happy and appreciative truly taught me that helping those with modest lives would be something that I would be interested in doing.  For me, I would like to touch people's lives through the field of medicine.  When my week and a half excursion ended, I returned to Capital with and enlightened outlook. As the spring semester closes each year, college students everywhere breathe their sigh of relief.  Summer has come and they can take a break.  In my case, break is not the correct terminology; I would say that summer is more of a change of pace.  Less than a week after classes are dismissed, my employment begins.  I work part-time for a small, independently operated cancer lab in Northern Kentucky, The Wood Hudson Cancer Research Laboratory.  In addition, I work another full time job to generate revenue that is necessary for college expenses.  When I first showed up to work two years ago at the lab, I was slightly uneasy.  I was worried about not knowing enough. Truthfully, up to that point I had never really considered myself interested in research.  As the summer went on, I found myself continually more comfortable in the atmosphere and was thoroughly pleased with the results of the summer.  It was an amazing opportunity to put the techniques and scientific ideas that I had learned in the classroom to use in a professional environment on experiments that had real purpose.  I gained much respect for the research scientist, by seeing how research advancements and medical breakthroughs come about and influence one another.  I have found the medical knowledge that I gained over the past summers invaluable in my college classes to follow.  Through my summer experiences and rigorous course load I have worked to prepare myself for the coursework that I will face in further schooling.  Through my trips and extra-curricular activities, I feel that I have worked to prepare myself for the wide diversity of requirements that will be placed on me.  I feel that all of these traits combined makes me uniquely qualified to handle the responsibility that medical school demands, also allowing me to satisfy my desire to help and serve others. Peer Tutoring As a peer tutor, I worked primarily on an individually arranged basis.  This past year, I helped to tutor in Biology, Chemistry (both General and Organic), as well as Calculus and other Math Courses., Beta Beta Beta National Biological Honor Society Beta Beta Beta is a National Biological Honor Society, honoring biology students for their academic achievement.  The Xi Tau Chapter was founded in 1999 and requirements for acceptance include 3 completed semesters of Biology coursework,  a paid and active member of the Life Sciences Organization, and an overall GPA of 3.3 (on a 4.0 scale) with a science GPA of 3.3.  Beta Beta Beta is involved in volunteer activities both on campus and throughout the community and also sponsors speakers and field trips with an interest in Biological Sciences., Student Research Assistant II Following my junior year of college, I was rehired back on at the Wood Hudson Cancer Research Laboratory as a member of the Undergraduate Research Education Program.  My employment there is current and I am working under the supervision of Dr. Julia H. Carter.  Dr. Carter's research is looking at breast tissue, both normal and cancerous case, for the presence of a specific protein, p21/Cdc42/Rac1-activated kinase 1 (Pak1).  While working with Dr. Carter, the majority of my time is spent in the histology lab.  I rehydrate slides, run them through an antigen retrieval process and stain them with Pak1 and Rabbit IgG antibodies so that they may be viewed under the microscope., Phantom Fireworks For the past two summers, I have been an employee of Phantom Fireworks in Amelia, Ohio.  While at this company, I worked primarily as a point of sale staff member, running one of the cash registers.  This employment offered me a steady, forty hour work week.  During the busy seasons, we were permitted to work unlimited overtime.  During this period, I worked 106 hours in one work week, explaining why my average work week was 55 hours.  During my first summer of work, I was also taking classes and this past year, I was working a second job.  These other commitments led to a great appreciation of time management., Orientation Assistant For two summers I was a member of the first-year student orientation staff.  As a peer group leader, I was in charge of a small group of new students helping them to make the transition to college.  This was a unique opportunity that allowed me to help others and become a good leader through activities and question and answer sessions., NCAA Division III Soccer I have been a part of the Capital University Men's Soccer team since my freshman year.  This coming year will be my fourth year as a member of the team, playing the position of goalkeeper.  Capital is very competitive as a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference and is NCAA Division III School.  My sophomore year, I was elected captain of our first ever Junior Varsity team.  The team's respect for my dedication and heart continued through my junior and senior years, as I was elected captain of the Varsity squad both years., Student Research Assistant I I was hired on at Wood Hudson Cancer Research Laboratory at the end of my freshmen year of college.  During my tenure at the lab, I was part of the Undergraduate Research Education Program, a program that matches undergraduate students with scientists study particular aspects of cancer.  During my time at the lab, I worked under two scientists, Dr. Kent Mitchell and Dr. Ranjani Parthasarathy.  While working with Dr. Mitchell, I prepared gels, and setup electrophoresis and polymerase chain reactions (PCR) experiments on human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 and 2 genes, looking for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's).  Dr. Parthasarathy's research was focused on the metastasis of cancer and while working with her, my primary duties included working in the cell culture lab, maintaining breast and prostate cancer cell lines as well as human osteoblast cell lines., Life Sciences Organization LSO is a student led organization on Capital's campus.  The goal of this organization is to unite students interested in biology through meetings and community service.  LSO does a wide variety of work throughout the community, ranging from preparing and serving meals at the Ronald McDonald House to educating elementary school students about the environment, animals, and organ systems.  LSO is also responsible for bringing in guest speakers to speak about professional programs and other scientific related topics.  I have been an active member since the fall of my freshmen year, and this coming year will be my second as LSO Treasurer., EMT Obeservations Since December of my sophomore year of college, I have been observing with the local life squad and fire department.  During a typical observation, I will spend the entire day at the fire station.  Being there all day has allowed me to observer a wide variety of runs.  My first run was a DOA (dead on arrival), and that was very interesting, being the first dead, unpreserved body that I have encountered.  I have also been a part of some transports, one of which was a man having a heart attack.  While not on runs I work with some of the EMT's on basic skills, such at intubations, IV's, and other first response medical techniques., Dean's List Since first being enrolled at Capital University in the fall of 2002, I have been a member of the Dean's List.  By maintaining a GPA of well over the necessary 3.4, my spot on the Dean's List has been secured.  Hard work has ensured that I have not had a semester with which I fail to receive this honor."

    "text": "I decided that I wanted to be a doctor after learning about the different parts of the body in my fourth grade science class. I doubt that Mr. Perry ever considered that by playing that silly song, the one that talks about the knee bone connecting to the thigh bone, the thigh bone connecting to the hip bone, etc., that he would influence one little girl's future career choice, but he did. Fortunately for me, Mr. Perry decided to play this song as a sort of before-break-treat, as school was letting out that day for Thanksgiving. Because of this auspicious timing, I would be able to tell all of my extended family about my newly-formed resolution. In typical nine-year-old fashion, I delayed the next day's holiday meal until I had informed each and every person sitting around the dinner table of my momentous decision.   This declaration induced a variety of reactions among my family members, but the one I remember most clearly came from my grandfather. The usually cheerful old man turned to look at me with an uncharacteristically somber expression on his wrinkled face. Without the slightest hint of a smirk or a grin he said, Now Melissa, you need to think about this choice. You need to think about it long and hard. You know why Because when doctors make mistakes, you just can't have mom come and fix them. Doctors have to bury their mistakes.   At the time, I obviously couldn't and didn't understand his stern admonition, but I was able to take to heart at least part of his reliable proclamation: the need to thoroughly contemplate whether pursuing a medical degree is what one really wants to do. Throughout all of college, I wrestled with my future career choice; I considered going into nursing, I looked into physician's assistant school, and even researched physical therapy, but was never really passionate about any of these fields.  I finally decided after talking to my father to call a family friend who works as an orthopedic surgeon. I asked him if he would care to let me shadow him and a few of his colleagues for a week or two over the summer. Luckily, he was more than willing, and I spent two weeks following him as he made his rounds around a hospital, during his time spent at a free clinic, and at his own private practice. I found his profession--fast-paced and challenging as it was--exhilarating. Simply put, I was hooked.   The aspect of this profession that really appealed to me was the wide range of responsibilities that he was faced with each day. The idea that on any particular day he could see patients in his office diagnostically, perform surgeries, and also complete rounds at the hospital enthralled me. It is this variety that truly interests me; the variety that exists not only in the medicine that he practices, but also in the patients that he sees each day. This is an attribute that, for me to remain engaged and motivated for the rest of my professional life, my future vocation must possess and is ultimately what attracts me so completely to the medical field.  \t I could conclude my essay with some notion of the importance of the work of doctors or of how I want to join the ranks of one of society's most respectable professions; but ultimately I think, for me, it all comes down to simply helping people. Of course, in going out of my way in an attempt to avoid a trite conclusion, I have perhaps stumbled upon the most clichd conclusion of them all--the desire to save the world. But I think helping people can come in many forms. Of course, doctors help people. They save lives and fix broken bones and deliver babies. But beyond the obvious, they help people in many other ways as well. They, like my father's friend, can help people figure out what they want to do with their lives. They can provide information on how to obtain health insurance. They can give bored siblings in the waiting room lollipops. There exists this seemingly infinite set of possibilities, of ways in which doctors can instigate change for the better. Of course, the truth of my grandpa's warning, that, Doctors bury their mistakes, has never seemed more real to me than in this moment, but what once only incited fear, now seems more like a challenge. A challenge that I now know I am ready to undertake in order to gain access to that infinite set of possibilities. Columbia Kids Approximately four times per year since 2006, while visiting my sister at Columbia University, I volunteered for the Columbia Kids organization. My sister was one of several coordinators for the organization. When volunteering for Columbia Kids, I, and numerous other college students, took underprivileged children from inner-city New York to various places throughout the city. These outings were both educational and recreational; some examples of the places we visited include the Barnum and Bailey Circus, the Children's Museum of Manhattan, and the Museum of Natural History., Child Care-Giver for the Hogenbirk Family I cared for the Hogenbirk Family's three children, aged seven, four, and four. Tasks included preparing meals, bathing, and providing entertainment for the three children until their parents returned., Dean's List I have been on the Dean's List every quarter in which I have have been enrolled at the Ohio State University. I was also placed on the Dean's List the one semester in which I was enrolled at Xavier University., Intramural Soccer I have played intramural coed soccer each quarter since the spring of 2007. We played one game per week for 5 weeks and then had a tournament after the completion of the regular season., Club Soccer I played on the Ohio State Indoor Soccer Club. We practiced twice a week for two hours each session and played one fifty minute game per week as well. I was elected by my peers to be the captain in December of 2009 and have continued serving as captain ever since., Denman Undergraduate Research Forum I presented my research discussing the role of mast cells in fetal wound healing at the Denman Undergraduate Research Forum. I created a poster presenting the data I obtained in both graphical and written form. Both my presentation and poster were judged by three different judges., Student Administrative Assistant I served as a student administrative assistant in the Data Services Department of Undergraduate Admissions for three consecutive quarters starting in Winter of 2007 and ending in Summer of 2007. I left this position because I found tutoring others to be a more lucrative and fulfilling experience. My duties in this department included entering data into databases, reviewing and sorting incoming mail, and scanning documents onto a server., Tutor for the Paradiso Family I served as a tutor for the Paradiso family's five daughters, aged sixteen, thirteen, ten, eight, and six. I covered topics such as biology, literature, and times tables two to three times per week., Shadowing of Dr. Stephen Ionna I shadowed Dr. Stephen Ionna for two consecutive weeks for approximately thrity hours per week. I witnessed him in diagnostic, clinical, and hospital settings. Dr. Ionna is a gastroenterologist, but he also introduced me to an orthopaedic surgeon, a doctor of internal medicine, and a pediatric oncologist. I was able to observe each of the aforementioned doctors for several hours each., English Tutoring of Freshman Students I tutored three freshman students enrolled in remedial english courses at Ohio State University. We met twice a week and discussed both their current course work and their own personal difficulties with the writing process. When papers were assigned by their professor, we reviewed the students' rough drafts and discussed the strengths and weaknesses., Volunteer at the Ohio State University Medical Center I volunteered in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit of the Ohio State University Medical Center. My duties included leading patients' families to the appropriate rooms, providing the families with information regarding general hospital information and policies, and any other miscellaneous errands which the patients' families requested., Head Babysitter I worked as the head babysitter in the Wee Folk Room in the Dublin Community Recreation Center. My job entailed entertaining numerous children at once while their parents were elsewhere within the recreation center. Other duties included general play room maintenance and planning group activities., Christmas Cheer In December of 2006, 2007, and 2008, I volunteered at the Salvation Army's Christmas Cheer event. Christmas Cheer is a charitable endeavor in which underprivileged families from around central Ohio receive food items for a holiday meal and presents for each of their children under the age of twelve. At this event I performed a variety of tasks including loading food items into bags/cars, helping parents to pick out gifts for their children, entertaining children while their parents picked out the aforementioned gifts, leading families through various stations, and any other miscellaneous task that needed to be performed., Heart to Heart Food Services Once a month since my senior year in high school, I have volunteered for the Heart to Heart Food Services program. This service provides food to underprivileged individuals and familes throughout the Columbus area. My duties included dishing food into styrofoam containers, helping to prepare various meals, and handing meals out to those in need., Undergraduate Research - Lab of Dr. Traci Wilgus Under the guidance of Dr. Traci Wilgus, I investigated the role of mast cells in fetal wound healing. Using primarily toluidine blue stain, we ascertained differences in mast cell number between wounded and unwounded embryonic day fifteen and embryonic day eighteen fetal mice. We found a significantly larger number of mast cells in wounded embryonic day eighteen fetal skin than in wounded embryonic day fifteen skin, suggesting that mast cells may in fact play a role in scar formation."

    "text": "The medical profession has been my goal for as long as I can remember. As my studies have progressed, the intricacy of the human body and its many functions has been a catalyst for my continued interest in medicine. I come from a very large and close-knit family background where my grandfather was the glue that held it all together.  His house served as a gathering place every Sunday after church for donuts and dinner. Since I was eleven, I remember walking around with my toy stethoscope telling my grandpa that I was going to be a doctor when I grew up. Grandpa was always supportive of my goals, and I can distinctly remember him telling me not to lose track of my determination because many years of hard work are needed to become a success. My grandpa worked three jobs for many years to support his family of eleven and his work ethic remains valued and respected amongst the family. There are many health professionals in my family and it is hard to believe that we have been so medically plagued. From a stroke suffered by my grandmother to my twenty-five year old cousin being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, it seemed as though the bad news would never end. When my grandfather was diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of eighty-seven after never having smoked, it seemed as though our family was going to fall apart. His work in a tile factory fifty years prior was the culprit for the development of this terminal lung cancer. My grandpa's hard work eventually claimed his life, but his belief in me to be a success still resonates and influences all that I do.   My grandpa's values have become instilled in me and have allowed me to patiently develop many new critical thinking skills. As a Supplemental Instructor for Chemistry, I led discussions for approximately ten students. I had to be able to convey the lecture concepts in multiple ways so all of the students could understand them. Although I was always prepared, it seemed like there was always one question asked that I could not respond to immediately. I had to think through the question on the spot in front of everyone and come up with an explanation for the student. Although it was a challenge, it is hard to put into words how I felt after interactions with students who were so grateful for my help. The looks on their faces when concepts clicked made all my efforts worthwhile. My leadership skills have much improved, and I know that in interactions with my patients in the future I will appear competent and confident.    Working as a student athletic trainer at Kalamazoo College has been pivotal in my development as a person. Working with athletes and their rehabilitations after an injury or surgery has provided me with insight about the rehabilitation side of medicine. Over time, I have learned that each athlete needs different motivation from me to complete his or her rehabilitation adequately because everyone responds differently to an injury. A mutual sense of trust between the athlete and myself takes time, and learning the best way to initiate the conversation is something that will follow me through my career as a physician. As a student athletic trainer, I stand on the sidelines and act as a first responder when an injury on the field or court occurs. I have to be ready to perform under pressure and be able to calmly treat the athlete. This past soccer season, an injury occurred when two players kicked the soccer ball simultaneously. The head trainer and I ran out onto the field in response to the grossly deformed knee injury. We splinted him and called for an ambulance, finding out later that he had broken his femur right above the knee. The adrenaline rush from this incident, and many others like it, has given me confidence that I will react correctly and calmly under pressure. Being a trainer has been an invaluable experience and my growth throughout the many injuries are far too numerous to write about here.   My experiences on the field are accompanied by my work in a breast cancer cell biology lab. This research examines specific tumor markers in breast cancer patients to better determine a treatment. I had always assumed that the research was time consuming, but I had pictured it as being black and white. I once believed that if an experiment did not work, it proved that the hypothesis wrong. However, I have learned that there is as much information in a failed experiment as in a successful one. Failures in laboratory settings drive the research in more directions that the original hypothesis ever would have predicted. My research on breast cancer showed me the great complexity of the disease and thus, its treatment, which is something I had not appreciated before. The intricacies of medical conditions fascinate me and I have come to realize how quickly the knowledge in a certain field changes. Keeping current is crucial for me to become a competent physician. Having coped with my family's medical issues will allow me to better understand what my patients and their families will go through. My past experiences with the athletes, my personal growth in leadership and interpersonal communication skills, and my hard work ethic learned from my grandpa will provide me with the ability to become a competent physician.

    "text": "The path that has brought me to apply to your medical school has been a varied one. I will be twenty-eight years old by the time of my matriculation, seven years removed from the undergraduate experience. I have been employed since then as a computer professional and paramedic.     My college career began in 1996 when, at the age of sixteen, I enrolled at the State University of West Georgia. The school had a special program called the Advanced Academy of Georgia that accepted early-admission students like me. In my two years there, I completed the undergraduate core curriculum, took advanced courses in mathematics, computer science, and music, and accomplished an honors research project in concert hall acoustics.     In 1998, I transferred to the University of Georgia and declared music performance as one of my majors. This led to a quality cello education that was supplemented by explorations into choral music, early music, and ballroom dance. My honors thesis was a conducting recital in which I led forty fellow musicians. Concurrently, I pursued a second major in mathematics. Although I might have achieved a higher GPA elsewhere, I selected the math department for its intellectual challenge. Three years later I had earned dual degrees in math and music.     At the age of eighteen, when I become financially independent, my occupation was that of computer professional -- creating software and administering networks.  At times during my student years I worked three jobs as a student assistant for the university, a network administrator for a private company, and a section player for symphony orchestras. Occasionally work assignments conflicted with study needs and in those cases I chose to put food on the table. My academic record is reflective of that choice, but I regret that I was unable to devote my full attention to scholarly pursuits at the time.     In 2002, the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University recruited me for a career that combined computer software development, network administration, and scientific research. The mix proved too attractive to decline and I made the move. Soon thereafter, I was searching for a way to become active in my new hometown when I stumbled upon the volunteer search and rescue (SAR) unit operated under the county sheriff. I signed up and completed the basic training. It is here that my interest in medicine enters the story.     When the SAR team prodded me to augment my expertise, I elected to pursue certification as an emergency medical technician (EMT) basic. A funny thing happened in the course of that training: I discovered that I enjoyed caring for the needs of others and that I had a propensity for learning physiology. I was surprised and amused by the revelation; my commander was dumbfounded.  Nonetheless encouraged, I continued my training beyond the EMT-Basic level and two years later achieved certification as an EMT-Paramedic.     In 2005, I began working part-time as a paramedic for local ambulance services, gaining clinical experience and perfecting my bedside manner.  Later I reversed the arrangement by working full-time as a paramedic and part-time as a computer professional. My income fell by roughly half but my personal satisfaction increased immeasurably. The arrangement continues to this day.     As a paramedic, it frustrates me when I encounter sick patients who have chronic complaints that cannot be addressed in the pre-hospital environment. Their treatment requires long time spans, far longer than a typical ambulance ride. The next step for me thus has revealed itself: I aspire now to even greater knowledge and responsibility than I enjoy presently as a paramedic. Your school will teach me to deliver long-term therapies, to address chronic conditions, and to help patients achieve lifetimes of health. I look forward to offering complete care to my patients in my future role as their physician.     I admit to being a late bloomer compared to many medical school applicants. In my undergraduate days, my interest in the biological sciences was naught and the appeal to me of a career in health care was less. Yet the past few years have brought a complete reversal: as a continuing studies student at Indiana University, I completed the requisite courses in biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, and physics with a grade-point average of 3.7 among them. I offer this performance, along with my scores on the MCAT and GRE tests, in support of my preparation for the academic rigor of your institution.     On a more functional level, my six years of real-world employment may distinguish my application. I have experience collaborating with others, mentoring coworkers, managing teams, and delivering results. My firsthand clinical experience may set me apart also. As a practicing paramedic, I am at ease when interacting with patients, I am accustomed to exercising clinical judgment in the pre-hospital environment, and I am comfortable accepting responsibility for my treatment decisions. My efforts in other fields have served only to inform the present decision: medicine is the right career for me.     In summary, I believe that I am ready for success in your program despite my nontraditional background. Thank you for your consideration. Paper Published by American Crystallographic Association A coworker delivered a presentation on behalf of my research group.  I managed the software development team that created the software described in this presentation and associated materials.  Citation:  John C. Bollinger, John C. Huffman, and Eric F. Koperda.  The Reciprocal Net - A Distributed Molecular Database.  Architecture and Features.  Proceedings of the American Crystallographic Association, Series 2, Volume 30. Cincinnati, Ohio, July 2003.  Abstract:  The Reciprocal Net is a database of molecular structure information, distributed over multiple participating sites and collaboratively maintained by the participants.  It provides support for laboratory workflow and information management, secure electronic dissemination of crystallographic results, interactive presentation of structural data, and preparation of publication materials.  In addition, the Reciprocal Net software presents a digital library collection view of the public samples that is incorporated in the NSF's National Science Digital Library (NSDL), and will provide means by which the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre can conveniently obtain data for public, never-to-be-published structures for incorporation into the CSD.  Details of the architecture, features, and current development directions will be discussed., First author of published Reciprocal Net User Guide As part of my employment at Indiana University's Molecular Structure Center, I authored a 100-page book on the subject of the Reciprocal Net site software.  (I also managed the software development team that created the software.)  The book instructs crystallographers in the use of the software and serves as a technical reference manual.  It codifies conventions for space group symbols, units of measure, calculation precision, file formats, and workflow procedures related to automated computer storage and analysis of x-ray crystallography data.  The methods described by the book have been adopted by roughly twenty academic crystallography research centers across the globe.  Citation:  Eric Koperda and John Bollinger.

Bloomington, Indiana, March 2005., Employment as a Computer Professional at U.G.A.S.O.M. I began serving my alma mater as a full-time computer professional shortly after my graduation in the year 2001.  Earlier, I had been employed by the School of Music as a student assistant.  My responsibilities had increased surreptitiously during those three student years and my transition to full-time staff status was predictable.  As a full-time employee, my duties included administering the department's network of about 200 computers, providing desk-side user assistance, overseeing three computer labs, installing new computers, repairing old ones, administering the department's servers, and creating a small assortment of software.  I had supervisory responsibility for twenty student lab assistants and three computer technicians.  I accepted the position with the School of Music as a matter of honor; there was a debt of personal gratitude to be repaid to the institution.  I approached the job with a special zeal for organization and a dedication to quality service.  Most days saw me working intensely from dawn to dusk, scarcely sitting down, but I never departed without a smile on my face.  I like to think that I was uniquely effective in the role due to my familiarly with the faculty and my status as a fellow musician-colleague.  More so than other jobs, I am proud of my service to the School., Honors Conducting Recital (Honors Thesis) I discovered an attraction to orchestral and choral conducting in the second year of my musical education at the University of Georgia.  I set out to learn more, and by the third year I had exhausted the undergraduate conducting curriculum and taken the graduate course as well.  The subject of my honors thesis, the capstone of my baccalaureate education, had become clear.  Under the auspices of the Honors Program, I organized three ensembles of my own and recruited a total of forty musicians to them.  The groups rehearsed under my baton weekly throughout the fall and winter.  Outside of rehearsals, I expended considerable effort in studying the music, reviewing video tape, coaching musicians on troublesome passages, and receiving counseling from my professor-advisors.  The project culminated in an hour-long concert one evening in February 2001.  I conducted a chamber choir as it sang four short sacred works in Latin without accompaniment.  I conducted a contemporary instrumental ensemble as it played the suite from L'Histoire du Soldat (The Soldier's Tale) by Stravinsky.  I conducted a string orchestra as it played Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis by Vaughan Williams.  These feats were without precedent for an undergraduate at my institution.  For me, the educational intensity was unparalleled., Critical Care Paramedic Education and Clinical Rotations I spent six months training to be a critical care paramedic, the highest grade within the emergency medical services (EMS) realm.  The experience built on my previous experience as a paramedic and included one semester of classroom work and several months of clinical rotations.  I visited Indiana's tertiary-care hospitals several days each week to shadow emergency physicians, hospitalists, internists, and critical care pulmonologists.  My familiarity with hospital-based care, that which occurs after I deliver my patients in from the field, increased and my clinical comfort zone expanded.  New procedures I learned and practiced included placing arterial lines, placing chest tubes, pericardiocentesis, performing ultrasound exams, monitoring invasive hemodynamic parameters, adjusting intra-aortic balloon pumps, and operating ventricular assist devices.  The program prepared me to care for patients in intensive care units and to transport patients between intensive care settings at different hospitals.  It also led to credentials as a Certified Flight Paramedic.  I expect to use these skills in the course of my employment with Columbus Regional Hospital., Employment as a Paramedic at Trans-Care I was employed as a paramedic with Trans-Care ambulance service based in Terre Haute, Indiana, first on a part-time basis (two 36-hour shits per month, on weekends) and later full-time (fifteen 12-hour shifts per month).  In this EMS system, the paramedic scope of practice included procedures like endotracheal intubation, rapid sequence induction, pleural decompression, placing central venous lines, drug administration, manual cardioversion, transcutaneous pacing, and of course advanced cardiac life support (ACLS).  Because my crew partners tend to be certified at the EMT-Advanced level or EMT-Basic level, I was accustomed to acting as the senior practitioner on-scene.  The challenge of treating patients with acute complaints, with limited knowledge of their history, in uncontrolled environments, at times sixty minutes from the nearest hospital appealed to me.  Those few occasions where I was able to deliver my patients to the emergency department in conditions better than when I found them filled me with pride. A surprising number of patients required little more than a safe ride to the hospital; to these I offered a hand of comfort and respect.  I enjoyed serving my fellow man in this way., Employment as a Computer Professional at Alogent Corporation I was employed by a software company in the Atlanta area concurrently with a portion of my undergraduate education.  A typical schedule involved 40-to-50-hour work weeks during summers and between semesters and 20-hour work weeks when classes were in session.  As I was financially independent (i.e. on my own) from age eighteen forward, the steady income from this job was necessary to fund my education and living expenses.  My wage was sufficiently generous that I was able to purchase a cello during my tenure as well.  My title was Senior Network Administrator and my duties included managing the company's computer network infrastructure, installing and maintaining its file servers, administering the e-mail systems, ensuring overall network security, and overseeing the work of between two and five other computer technicians.  As an ancillary duty, I created and developed software for internal intranet applications, automated software distribution, server health monitoring, help desk ticket tracking, and wide area network access.  I departed the company in 2001, during my final undergraduate semester, in order to concentrate my energies on graduating from school in style.  (Please see the experience entry that describes my honors conducting recital.), Employment as a Paramedic at C.R.H. I was employed full-time as a paramedic with Columbus Regional Hospital (CRH) and was assigned to an ambulance that served the community of Brown County, Indiana.  My shift pattern was 24 hours on-duty followed by 48 hours off-duty.  The work environment was outstanding; reporting for duty was a real joy.  At CRH as elsewhere, the full spectrum of advanced life support procedures was available to me and the administration of several dozen drugs in the field was authorized.  My regular partner was certified as an EMT-Basic; thus, I was accustomed to acting as the senior practitioner on-scene.  I was held responsible for the overall care of my patients and was held accountable for the behavior of my fellow rescuers. My principal duty was direct patient care to sick and injured patients who had called 9-1-1.  Between runs, I contributed to the department's clinical quality by serving on the protocol committee, advocating for thorough documentation, leading educational seminars, and teaching resuscitation and acute-care courses to my coworkers at the hospital.  I acted as a mentor to my partner, to my coworkers on the shift, to fire department first responders, and to EMT trainees and students. The experience at CRH furthered my education, strengthened my leadership skills, and refined my bedside manner., EMS Training and Clinical Volunteer Time I was trained in emergency medical services first as an EMT-Basic, then as an EMT-Intermediate, and eventually as an EMT-Paramedic over the course of two years.  Related certifications I earned during the period included CPR, advanced cardiac life support, pediatric advanced life support, pre-hospital trauma life support, emergency vehicle operations, and passenger vehicle extrication.  The training included five hundred hours in hospitals shadowing emergency physicians, internists, surgeons, anesthesiologists, pathologists, obstetricians, and nurses.  I learned a number of procedures including intravenous access, medication administration, endotracheal intubation, childbirth, placing Foley catheters, and reading 12-lead electrocardiograms.  By the end of the experience I operated more independently as a volunteer member of the emergency department's team: triaging, taking histories, performing initial exams, and practicing my clinical skills.  The training also included five hundred hours on ambulances shadowing paramedics, practicing the same skills I had been taught in the more controlled environments of hospitals.   One observation: starting IV's in the back of a truck traveling eighty miles per hour down a bumpy highway is not trivial., Dean's List In recognition of the grades I earned in my courses in Fall Quarter 1996 at the State University of West Georgia, my name was placed on the Dean's List in December 1996.  I repeated the accomplishment in Winter Quarter 1997 and my name was listed again in March 1997.  Both of these awards occurred in my first year at S.U.W.G.  At the time, I was living on-campus and taking a full load of regular college courses, even though I had completed only two years of high school and had not yet received a high school diploma.  Later, in May 2000, my name was placed on the Dean's List a third time in acknowledgement of my Spring Semester 2000 grades at the University of Georgia., Search-and-Rescue Volunteer My life in Bloomington, Indiana involved a volunteer commitment that I took very seriously: the search and rescue (SAR) unit operated under the county sheriff.  When a hiker was lost or injured in Hoosier National Forest, for example, the sheriff was notified and my team was sent out to look for him.  This happened about once per month. Most incidents were resolved with a few hours' effort but a few were multi-day affairs.  Other than field operations, related commitments included basic SAR training, advanced training in search management, twice-weekly practice sessions, thrice-yearly major exercises, and participation in SAR conferences across the state.  In the years 2004 through 2006 I was elected to serve as my unit's finance officer and was entrusted with the organization's treasury. My principal duty was accounting: tracking the money as it arrived and departed again.  The most notable accomplishment of mine was transitioning the group from a simple association to a non-profit corporation recognized by the I.R.S. as a tax-exempt entity.  On the educational side, I helped teach the regional SAR training program in my portion of the state and also served as an associate instructor for Indiana Department of Homeland Security at the statewide SAR academy., Self-employment as a Cello Player My musical instrument of choice was the cello: I began playing at age eight and later earned a degree in music performance.  Starting in the year 1998, I put my talents to work to supplement my income.  I took perhaps a dozen informal gigs per year, the majority being weddings and formal parties.  I and three other string players assembled an ad-hoc string quartet for these.  Besides informal gigs, I was formally engaged at various times by the professional symphony orchestras in Gainesville, Georgia; Macon, Georgia; Columbus, Indiana; and Terre Haute, Indiana.  In some years I was a substitute player and in others I was on contract as a regular section player.  A busy year would see me playing in ten concert programs, each involving two to four hours of performance and eight to fifteen hours of rehearsal.  With my orchestras and ensembles I grew more familiar with the symphonic repertory, was introduced to the concepts of self-employment and labor unions, and learned firsthand the value of teamwork.  Regretfully, the income from my musical employment never was sufficient to cover my living expenses.  Cello-playing thus was relegated to the discordant status of principal joy but secondary occupation for me., Employment as a Computer Professional at I.U.M.S.C. The Molecular Structure Center was a unit within the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University. As a service crystallography facility, it utilized the science of x-ray diffraction to analyze crystals of substances that had been synthesized or isolated by research chemists. I was employed full-time by IUMSC as their computer professional.  A portion of my time was spent supporting the unit's sixty computers and network devices, but my principal duty was software development for the Reciprocal Net project. I led a team of between two and ten computer programmers that created a distributed database system for small molecule structures.  Additionally, I provided technical support and customer service to the twenty other crystallography labs that had deployed the software.  More information is available at www.reciprocalnet.org .  The work at IUMSC was novel for me in that it was oriented around academic research: my colleagues were scientists with PhD's in chemistry who took the publish or perish doctrine to heart.  Please see the two publication experiences and one presentation experience that resulted from this employment.  A little bit of the lab's crystallography expertise rubbed off on me during my time at IUMSC: in the year 2005, I measured, solved, and refined my first crystal structure., Simulations of Concert Hall Acoustics by Digital Means This independent project of mine spanned two years and led to a 37-page research paper, a 15,000-line computer program, and a poster presentation at the International Science and Engineering Fair in Fort Worth, Texas in May 1998.  Notable awards from the conference included third prize in the physics division and Best Use of a Personal Computer.  The substantial cash prizes funded my continued education.  Abstract:  A method for the digital simulation of concert hall acoustics has been developed. Unlike common reverb processors, this simulation model is derived from construction blueprints. The method is useful for simulating the acoustic product of an arbitrary orchestra that performs in an arbitrary concert hall. To evaluate the technique's validity, a string quartet performed short musical excerpts at four concert halls and a recording studio in the Atlanta area. Sound recordings from the studio were processed by simulation engines configured to mimic the ambience of the four real-world environments. (Processing was executed by a cluster of 40 desktop computers running for 450 hours each.) In controlled listening tests, a panel of classical musicians detected no statistically significant differences between sound recordings from the real concert halls and those from their virtual counterparts."

    "text": "She gurgled ever so softly as I gently rocked her to sleep. Amisha was but a baby when I first laid eyes on her at Mercy Mission Home. Her mother had abandoned her by the village temple. Unlike most other female infants, she was lucky to be alive. Many were killed with a lethal dose of rat poison and the less fortunate were buried alive. As part of the 'adopt-a-village' volunteer group, we were on a mission, educating the villagers against female infanticide. As if things weren't bad enough, the grim reaper disguised as cholera was sweeping relentlessly through the village. I could see a hint of doubt in the eyes of our volunteer coordinator. However, Dr. AJ, the accompanying physician seemed unfazed. While Dr. AJ was a physician of the finest caliber, he also knew how to connect with the locals. He was genuinely compassionate to each patient and he gave him or her the individual attention they desperately craved. As he worked his magic, he instilled mutual trust with each patient. He promised to visit the village every so often and provide free medical care to every family that kept their female babies. As he went about his routine, I realized how he was trying to communicate by breaking down cultural and social barriers.                                 Ever since I was growing up, my family told me that I was going to be a doctor. Maybe they felt that way because I walked around with a suitcase full of empty powder bottles playing doctor when I was five, or maybe it was because I seemed fascinated by the mix of traditional and western medicine in India. Whatever the reason, I didn't think much of it back then. But my volunteering experiences helped me grow up real fast. I realized how frustrating it could be as a physician to educate people and give them access to medicine, as on my trip with Dr. AJ. That, combined with the National Cadet Corps and various organizations like Green Peace left me with a collage of intense memories that strengthened my resolve to fulfill what was to be my 'destiny'.                                 My life's first bitter defeat was when I had to withdraw my medical school application due to my family's financial duress. The booming Information Technology field seemed like a good second choice and I decided to work on becoming a Computer Engineer. I still remember my mother saying, All roads lead to Rome. So if medicine is your Rome, then keep striving and you won't lose your way. This, and with the endless possibilities of Computer Technology reeled me in. I found that my research in Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks could easily be applied to medicine. For all its impressiveness, I couldn't help but notice that a computer is only as good as it's user. Through all this, little did I know that a twist of fate was to give me one more chance just like it did little Amisha.                                     I stood huddled by the airport exit shivering partly due to the cold on a May morning in 2003. I thought back to the day I got the news that we were going to America. We had to sell the family car to afford the plane tickets. This gave me a second opportunity to study medicine. I would later go on to complete my premed studies through financial aid. A full time job and a full-time enrollment in college did take its toll on me, but it toughened me up. I decided to take a couple of years off before applying to medical school. During this time I saved up enough money for a couple of years of medical school and took up a few volunteering positions. I realized that I still had that same spark in me, the one that had lighted in me a burning desire to be a caregiver. The one that would empower me to help and care for several other little Amishas. Computer Analytics for Drug Discovery and Heart Monitors I had an opportunity to work on computer research with applications in the field of medical technology quite a few times. My first opportunity was at the research lab at Tidal Park. We implemented the concepts of neural networks, fuzzy logic and expert systems for several medical related areas including disease diagnosis and bio-medical engineering. My second paid research was at a pharmaceutical company in California. Here I worked with scientists in their Drug Discovery Project. Simulation models were created, complex random generation algorithms were written and the drug template flowcharts were modified. Through these projects I realized the tremendous potential of Computer Technology as a contributor to the field of Medicine., Karate Instructor I started out at the early age of 7, to master the art of Karate. After 6 long years which included sparring sessions, participating in various tournaments in India and mastering sequences called Katas, I moved up 8 belts all the way up to brown (which precedes the black belt). Karate instilled not only self-confidence, but also taught me the value of every individual. We are at no time to ever use Karate on another human being except in self defense is the motto of our karate school. I also learned to be highly disciplined while striving to attain my goals., Physician Shadowing and Medical Experience I started volunteering as a Medical volunteer for the National Cadet Corps in India. During the adopt-a-village month, we would go around distributing food and medicines and also educating people. Polio day was particularly interesting, as we would go around reminding people to get polio vaccines for their babies and go about inoculating them. I also had the opportunity to shadow two physicians (one in India and one in the US - family practice/internal medicine) for six months. While I volunteered at a nursing home (Merrick) in Long Island - New York, I learned that although not all experiences have fairy-tale endings, they play an important role in making critical decisions later in life., Computer Engineer I started working in Information Technology after completing my premed requirements at Wright State University. My key intentions were to get financially stable and emotionally ready to tackle the rigors of Medical School. I initially started out as a computer consultant, moving across states in the US working on short-term research projects. I finally settled down for a permanent job in Cincinnati with a large financial institution. During this stint, I updated myself in not only the bleeding edge of Computer technology, but also learned the importance of cultivating relationships and working as a team. As a Project Lead and Administrator, I learned to handle the pressures of responsibility and deadlines., Outstanding Student of the Year I was awarded the Outstanding Student of the Year for my academic and extracurricular and volunteer excellence during my undergraduate education. I was declared the college topper (top student in academics) in my college in the field of Computer Science. I was in the Dean's list with highest honors every quarter, when I took my premed courses at Wright State University. While I am not one to rest on his laurels, these gave me the confidence to tackle bigger obstacles later in life. It also motivated me to strive to give the best I can to be the best I can., Teaching Assistant and Night School Tutor I worked as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant in College. I also provided tutoring for high school students in Math, Science and English. Students were also trained for the Board Exams (similar to SAT/ACT). I learned the virtue of patience while dealing with students., Green Peace and Quake-Aid Worker My earliest volunteer experience was with the  Each-1-Teach-1 project.  We had to help teach one person to read and write and recruit another person to join the program. Another city project that I volunteered for was the green peace project. We went around town, removing litter and planting trees. The team spirit that came off these projects during my teenage years is something I will cherish forever. However, my most significant experience was when a group of students from our school went as aid-workers during the Bhuj earthquake of 2001.We went around distributing food, blankets and medicines. More than the physical damage, it was re-building the crushed spirits of the people that was arduous. However, there were also some heartening stories - people who had lost all their possessions, but were happy just to see all their family members alive. It was during times like this that I came to realize how money paled in comparison to good health and life itself."

    "text": "The first time I seriously considered my future career was in sixth grade. Our teacher asked us to fill out a lengthy questionnaire about our interests and dislikes so we could figure out what we should be when we grow up. At the time, I enjoyed Nancy Drew novels and playing on the swing set. I despised fractions and geography. It was concluded that I should become a model, an astronaut, or a teacher. From that day forward, it seemed, people continually hounded me about my future and until recently, I was never able to provide them with a satisfactory agenda for my life. It was not that I did not plan. I carried around my planner like a third arm and outlined anything that could be put into list form, but I was not yet ready to proclaim which road I was going to travel for the remainder of my life.  In high school biology class, I remember sitting in the second row and learning about DNA replication for the first time. I could barely believe that what my teacher was explaining to the class was true. The existence of life is remarkable and the human body is simply miraculous. I felt like I had been told the secrets of how we work and was bursting with my newfound knowledge. The order and organization of people are beautiful. At the same time, life is delicate and can be messy. It is imperfect and confusing, but incredibly fascinating. I knew that I wanted to be in the middle of all the complexity, learning and discovering.  Despite my enthusiasm for the sciences, I was quite comfortable with the undecided status of my first year in college and dragged my feet on declaring a major. I liked writing, calculus, genetics, religion, and psychology and was too busy savoring the freedom of taking interesting classes to lock myself into a rigorously defined curriculum. Eventually, I began feeling a small sense of panic about my lack of official direction and hesitantly made the trek to the zoology department to declare my major. After hearing my roommates relay stories from their political science and engineering classes, I was certain that my decision to become a science nerd was the perfect choice for me. When I finally said, I want to be a doctor, out loud and confidently for the first time, I could not help but smile. I pinned up a periodic table on my bedroom wall, tied a surgical mask around my bedpost, and started getting excited about the years to come.  I could have pursued a hundred different careers, and probably wanted to at one point in my life, but medicine offers a challenging and distinct opportunity that I simply cannot resist. I want to go to medical school because I believe I will be a very good doctor. I am a passionate person and want a career into which I can eagerly put my all. I always thought it was rather pointless to do something half-heartedly, and though I know medical school and becoming a physician will be difficult and frustrating, I believe it is something to which I can fervently dedicate a considerable portion of my life.  Doctors are lucky people. Their job is to work amid combinations of scientific facts and structure with the unpredictability and uniqueness of individuals. Most importantly, doctors invest in others lives and I cannot think of anything else I would rather do. I have learned that our relationships with others represent what is truly important in our lives. I also believe that one of the greatest gifts we can give others is to share in their suffering. As a physician, I will have the resources to not only listen and offer empathy, but to also take an active role in relieving pain and afflictions. It excites me that I have a chance to put these skills to use everyday in a career in medicine.  When I think about who has inspired and encouraged me to become a doctor, I realize that my motivators really just taught me how to love and care about people. Helping people satisfies something so sacred and foundational. I can only hope that the gifts of active listening and genuine compassion are as deeply embedded in me as they are in those who defined these wonderful attributes for me. I do not pretend to completely appreciate how to selflessly act towards others, but I do know that I have been guided to this path and that I will constantly be progressing towards a deeper understanding of what it means to simply be there for others in their times of need.  Being a doctor will provide the means to impact lives and serve people. No two patients will be exactly the same and it will be stimulating to interact with diverse individuals. I will be challenged daily, and the job will be anything but monotonous. I will never finish learning everything there is to know in my field and will value the need for continued education.  I am nervous and excited about the demanding process of becoming a doctor. Education is a blessing and a journey. I know it will be deeply rewarding to be called Doctor for the first time, but medical school is not only a means to this end; it will be an adventure in itself. My life will not finally start when I first put on a white coat, but it will be a significant milestone that will begin an amazing new chapter. Overnight Host About every two weeks, a prospective student stayed with me in my dorm room for one night.  I showed her around campus, answered questions, and brought her to some of my classes.  This opportunity served as a way for the prospective student to get a current student's perspective on Miami and to obtain a realistic idea of what it would be like to be a Miami student., Participant, Team Captain During my freshman year, I participated in Relay for Life.  This required collecting at least $100 worth of donations and walking during an all-night, 18-hour event.  I was a team captain my sophomore and junior years and will be again this upcoming year.  This position requires recruiting team members, encouraging them to collect donations, holding at least two team meetings, organizing the team set-up for the all-night event, attending team captain meetings, and planning a fundraiser., Server I am a server at the original Bravo, an Italian restaurant.  My responsibilities include being familiar with the available menu items and the extensive wine list, serving guests, handling the payment, delivering food, and cleaning., Member, Bible Study Leader, Discipler I attend the weekly meetings of Campus Crusade for Christ.  Each one includes praise and worship songs, announcements, a teaching, and prayer.  I also attended a spring break trip with Campus Crusade to Daytona Beach, Florida during my freshman year.  The focus of the trip was to initiate spiritual conversations with people we met on the beach.  The trip helped me develop communication skills and confidence in social interactions with strangers.  Furthermore, I attend a weekly Bible study.  I am also discipled by my Bible study leader.  For both my Bible study and my discipleship time, I am expected to prepare by reading various materials.   I also lead a Bible study for women.  We meet weekly to discuss the Bible and what it means to be a Christian.  This leadership role requires planning, preparation, attending, and facilitating discussion for each meeting.  In addition to the group Bible study, I meet weekly with an individual girl as well.  This activity is termed discipleship and it serves as time to develop a more personal relationship.  My role is to be a spiritual resource for the younger woman., Member, Honors Ambassador I have been a member of the Miami University Honors Program since freshman year.  I am required to complete ten honors experiences before I graduate.  In addition to the classes, the Honors Program sponsors various social and educational activities.  I was also an Honor's Ambassador during the second semester of my sophomore year.  This required making phone calls to prospective students, facilitating discussions between visiting prospective students, and completing additional ambassador activities and training exercises., Shadowing I shadowed Dr. Lori Sullivan for about 50 hours during the summer of 2005.  She is a family physician with patients from newborn babies to 98-year-olds.  I sat in on patients' appointments and simply observed the interactions between the patients and Dr. Sullivan.  This experience allowed me to appreciate the responsibilities of a doctor in family medicine.  I also gained a better understanding of the various roles a family physician plays: doctor, counselor, confidant, and friend.  I saw numerous unique illnesses and health-related problems, as well as met amazing individuals., Server, Hostess I was a waitress at Bob Evans during the summer. I was required to interact with my customers, occasionally work the cash register, complete my cleaning duties, and prepare some of the food.  Additionally, I was given the responsibility of training new waitresses and waiters., Office Employee I was employed at a medical practice of four family physicians.  I was required to complete paperwork, sort mail, check in the patients, file charts, and aid in the overall organization of the office.  The job provided a great perspective of the inner-workings of a doctor's office., Volunteer I was fortunate enough to serve others by volunteering in a medical setting.  Stationed in post-operative orthopedic surgery, my duties of assisting the nurses and aids included changing bed sheets, restocking supplies, hooking up electric icepacks, providing the surgical patients with warm blankets, and wheeling them to various rooms after their initial recovery.  I was also privileged to observe two orthopedic surgeries."

    "text": "My career at Saint Elizabeth Medical Center was over.  As a Volunteen, I was trained to make beds, push wheelchairs, and fetch ice chips.  How did I become responsible for undressing vulnerable cardiac patients and helping them use the bedside toilet  The stench, the unnatural color of the patients' skin, and the reality of death were overwhelming to a sophomore in high school.  Tears ran down my face as I explained to my mother my inability to detach from the suffering at the hospital.  I most definitely could not go back... \tWait, do I want to be a doctor I jokingly asked my freshman year roommate before making my first college bookstore purchase.  My arms were filled with novels and an assortment of paperbacks that would carry me through my first two years at Notre Dame.  Dismissing my question as we approached the cashier, my roommate replied, Well, you have five minutes to decide the rest of your life.  Despite that brief hesitation, I bought my books and declared a Theology/English double major.  It was not until second semester of sophomore year that I reexamined my decision. \tI was skimming another English syllabus, searching for anything remotely interesting amid the medieval literary masterpieces.  When I came across Beowulf, I seriously questioned why I was an English major.  Even more, I questioned whether my current major would lead to a fulfilling career where my strengths would benefit society.  My mind began to drift to the crippled woman I encountered on the street in El Salvador, the disabled community at the South Bend Logan Center, and the homeless I met in Cincinnati's Over-the-Rhine while on an Urban Plunge.  A variety of experiences such as these alerted me to the lack of quality health care among the poor in the United States and abroad.  I asked myself, who cared for those outside mainstream society  Through much prayer and a realistic assessment of my talents, I decided to pursue medicine--the career that had been in the back of my mind for so long.   \tJunior year, in an attempt to complete the pre-requisites for medical school in two years instead of four, I embarked on a science-intensive curriculum.  By senior year, I was a theology major taking sophomore organic chemistry as an elective.  In addition to completing the necessary coursework, I began volunteering at a health clinic to preview life as a physician.  The more exposure I had to the medical profession, the more convinced I became that being a doctor is the career that will fulfill me for the rest of my life.  At the clinic, I was no longer fetching ice chips, but instead taking patients' blood pressures, temperatures, pulses, heights, weights, and recording their symptoms.  These responsibilities, as well as direct patient contact, made me excited to return to the clinic week after week.  Often, interaction with patients motivated me to better prepare myself to be a doctor truly capable of working with impoverished communities.  For example, trying to communicate with the ever growing number of Hispanics at the clinic inspired me to write a grant proposal that is enabling me to return to El Salvador this summer to learn medical/conversational Spanish, work in a children's hospital, and research health care injustice.   \tHaving matured since my days as a Volunteen, I realize a key to being a great physician is not the ability to detach, but rather a willingness to accompany a patient through his or her suffering.  I look forward to accompanying the poor of Rogers Park, Chicago in a unique way this upcoming year as an Amate House Volunteer.  Working at the Howard Area Community Center, I hope to witness the risk factors that threaten urban populations and assist in developing public health programs in the area.  I am grateful to have found a career that gives my life a sense of purpose and I anxiously anticipate the experiences, opportunities, and challenges that await me in medical school. Casa de la Solidaridad For one month, I am studying intensive medical/conversational Spanish, working at the Benjamin Bloom Children's Hospital, and taking a course on public health., Faith-Based Group at Juvenile Correctional Facility I co-founded a faith-based group at the all-male South Bend Juvenile Correctional Facility. The group met once a week to discuss goals, talents, spirituality, and play music and cards. I brought in Notre Dame quarterback, Brady Quinn, to be a positive role model for the inmates. The main purpose of the program was to show the young men they were loved and not forgotten by their community., Pasquerilla West Hall President I organized numerous dorm events from dances to lectures to barbeques to service projects to starting a school-wide lip synching contest to bringing the first mechanical bull to campus. I held weekly hall council meetings and was in charge of overseeing approximately twenty hall commissions., Biology Lab Teaching Assistant I prepared and facilitated weekly biology labs for a freshman biology major course., Saint Joseph's Health Clinics I volunteered at St. Joseph's Healthy Family Center junior year and St. Joseph's Health Center senior year, both of which serve the poor of South Bend.

    "text": "Science has always been a fascinating and intriguing field to me. Even as a child, I would examine earthworms after a big storm. In high school biology lab I always volunteered to do the dissecting. My passion for science is one reason why I want to attend medical school.  Another important reason is that medical school will provide me with the knowledge and ability to understand the complex organism that is the human body. That knowledge will ultimately enable me to diagnose and treat patients so they may live longer and improve their quality of life, the principal reason I wish to be a physician. Medicine also fulfills the Jesuit mission to lead and to serve others. Additionally, I feel I possess traits and experiences which make me an ideal candidate for medical school, including service, research, and a commitment to teamwork.    After reading Tracy Kidder's Mountains Beyond Mountains, I realized how much change can be made in the world, especially by physicians and health care workers, and as a result, my motivation to attend medical school intensified. Dr. Paul Farmer, whose exploits form the subject of Kidder's Mountains Beyond Mountains, has made great strides in combating tuberculosis and AIDS in Haiti, Peru, and Russia. Farmer's book, Pathologies of Power, has further inspired me to serve outside the hospital and in a poverty and disease-stricken area, whether it is downtown Cleveland, Ohio or Tijuana, Mexico.  My service/immersion trip to Tijuana opened my eyes to the social, political, and medical change needed there. Throughout my 10-day stay, I worked directly with people of the communities making concrete pathways at schools. I came to realize and respect how much work the community members put into their children's schools, even though the facilities paled in comparison to any school in the U.S. Tijuana made me appreciate my comforts as a citizen of the United States, where I have access to amenities such as a clean water supply, electricity, and a roof over my head. As a physician, I would be able to work at a free/low cost clinic so that patients might have a better chance to survive and thrive in their current situation. Overall, my experience in Tijuana enabled me to become more understanding, observant, and open-minded.    My study abroad experience in Copenhagen, Denmark also helped me to be understanding and respectful of different cultures. My time in Copenhagen and other European cities opened my eyes to the different health care and educational systems in Western Europe. In general, my experience of adjusting to a new city, culture, and language broadened my perspective of the world.   Both my experiences in Tijuana and Copenhagen have strengthened my resolve to become a physician and have further developed my leadership abilities. I am keenly aware of how important it is to be a team player, especially as the Biology Club secretary, a leader of the First Year Student Retreat, and a member of the Varsity Women's Golf team. All of these experiences have taught me that organization, communication, and most importantly teamwork are necessary for the success of any endeavor.  Teamwork is also crucial between researchers and clincians. For two summers I worked at the Washington Hospital (one summer in the lab and one in case management) in Washington, PA and witnessed how an organization of over 2,000 employees worked to together to provide patient care. This summer I performed clinical research concerning heart failure patients' readmission rates as well as investigated ER use by managed care and welfare patients. Last summer I researched how glutathione (a non-protein thiol and important anti-oxidant) plays a role in the activation of caspases and subsequent apoptosis (programmed cell death). That experience made me appreciate how much time and effort researchers spend for the advancement of medicine. Certainly, both laboratory and clinical research are pertinent to the development of medical science.  Medicine constitutes a field that will forever be changing. This means all physicians, nurses, and health care workers must continually educate themselves on new procedures, medications, and advancements in patient care. Every day I find something new to read and learn; reading and learning is a habit and pastime essential to my well-being and to my goals as a physician. I have a sincere commitment to science, better healthcare, and to learning. I believe in Rudolf Virchow's statement in Mountains Beyond Mountains, that (m)edical education does not exist to provide students with a way of making a living, but to ensure the health of the community. This sentiment exemplifies the true purpose of medicine and my desire to serve patients and society. Immersion/Service trip to Tijuana, Mexico 10 day trip to Tijuana. Worked with community members directly mixing and spreading cement at local schools.  Attended several seminars and went on field trips in Tijuana including Eco Park.  The Park used run off water to water a hill side creating green space.  Also visited a maquiladora (foreign owned company that operates out of Tijuana)., First Year Retreat Leader As a leader I helped to organize and plan the retreat for 40 first year students.  Planning included choosing music, prayers, games, and other activities to introduce the new students to Campus ministry, the Jesuit mission, and activities/organizations on campus., Investigation of Glutathione's role in caspase-3 activation Biochemistry invesitgation of glutathione's role in caspase-3 activation and subsequently apoptosis (programmed cell death).  Apoptosis was  induced by oxidative stress through the addition of the chemical tertiary hydroperoxide (T-OOH).  Glutathione levels were measured with the use of HPLC, and caspase-3 activation was detected with Western blot.  Cultured ATCC Jurkat cancer cells were used for all experiments., Case Management and Health and Wellness student Clinical research on the number of managed care patients utilizing the ER instead of a PCP.  Research on the readmission rates of heart failure patients participating in the Heart Failure Support Program compared with those who do not participate.  Helped with organization of a 5K run for hospital employees as well as consults/screens for employees.

    "text": "I remember being calm.  She was crying and bloody, but I remember feeling relieved after understanding the situation.  I had faith she would ultimately be ok and I knew, in that moment, I could help.  My friend had cut herself on purpose multiple times on both of her arms in our dorm in the middle of the night and now she was standing in my doorway, weeping.  I knew she had done this before; the off-color tracks running up her arm let everyone know that she was someone familiar with pain.  Unfortunately, it is due to these very scars that she often refuses to seek help for her physical and emotional traumas.  The quick assumptions reflected in her would be helper's eyes and voice when they glance over her marked arms is often too much for her to bear.  She was tired of going in for a broken finger and getting a full psychological evaluation instead.  That night, however, she decided to take a chance with me.  After I had given her an enveloping hug, we went to the sink and began washing off the redness that was dripping off her arms.  The blood didn't bother me, but her emotion flooded me.  I knew how to keep it from overpowering me though.  In my life I have found I have been placed in these situations time and again.  Whether because I was a counselor, a facilitator, or leader or because I was simply needed, people have come to me in times of pain or confusion and have looked to me for strength.  Sometimes the problems are easy and only require some careful listening and a quick referral.  Other times, like this night with my friend, the problems are a little more scary and complicated.  Wherever the situation lies on the spectrum between simple and complicated, I find the same approach is usually the wisest.  I take my time and try and understand the problem in its entirety and then give aid with a gentle hand.  Gathering courage from my past experience I was able to stay with my friend as we talked about pain and hope and choices.  I cleaned, disinfected, and bandaged her physical wounds and we laughed when she called me Dr. Will.  Later that week I held her hand as she waited to go talk to a real doctor at psychological services.  As is life, there have been ups and downs since that time and as much as I worry and care I know that her health is in her hands alone; I believe that everyone is accountable for their own healing first and foremost.  However, I also believe that healing cannot always be done alone and sometimes being accountable means knowing when you need help.  I am honored to think that my friend trusted and respected me enough to ask me for help when she needed it most.  I know that it can be difficult to ask for this help because it requires a significant amount of trust.  And I know firsthand as a person who identifies as gay how hard it can be to give that trust when prejudice and misunderstanding seem to be everywhere you look.  I have sometimes felt uncomfortable disclosing important information even when talking to medical professionals.  I have gone so far as to censor important details even when I knew confidentiality and impartiality were legally assured.  Trust is a fragile thing and sometimes all it can take to violate it is a sideways glance or a careless comment.  I believe that the expertise and experience I have gained combined with medical training will enable me to develop and tap into my potential to reach out and give strength and health to other people more fully.  I want to be able to spend everyday of my life earning and deserving people's trust and respect and then be as effective as possible when those bridges have been built.  This is why I want to study medicine; this is why I want to study to become a healer, a doctor. Male Sexuality Workshop Facilitator After a written application and an interview process I was selected to be one of four M-Sex facilitators.  I was responsible for writing and revising the syllabus and then facilitating this entirely student run and designed course.  The discussion based course focuses on the individual's experience of male sexuality and topics range from fatherhood to societal expectations to anatomy.  There is an emphasis on processing and sharing individual experience, but there is a large degree of general sexual health information disseminated as well.  Each class has about 15 students and 2 facilitators.  The class itself met twice a week for two hours.  I also participated in weekly meetings and a facilitation class that met bi-weekly as well.  Guest professors and other educators often participated in this facilitation class.  This is the first year the Male Sexuality Workshop has existed at Brown., Brown Outdoor Leadership Training Leader After an application process and an interview I was selected to be a BOLT leader.  I received training including Wilderness First Aid (WFA), CPR, low impact camping, and risk management.  I also learned how to facilitate productive discussion, manage group dynamics, and run leadership training group activities.  I was responsible for the safety and well being of 7 Brown rising sophomores as we backpacked for five days through the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  BOLT's stated mission is to foster the exploration and practice of leadership styles while establishing a community of support for sophomore students., Female and Male Sexuality Workshop Participant I participated in the Female Sexuality Workshop (FemSex) the spring semester of my junior year and the Male Sexuality Workshop (M-Sex) the fall semester of my senior year, which was the first semester M-Sex was offered.

See the M-Sex Facilitator description for a more detailed description of what the classes entail., Theater I performed in 2 musicals and one show my freshman year (West Side Story, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, and Alice In Wonderland) and 2 musicals my senior year (Chicago and Hair).  Four of the five were entirely student run and directed (musical forum) and one was directed by a professor (mainstage).  Each performance would last about two months for rehearsal through performance.  We would rehearse at least 20 hours a week and then a lot more as the performance approached., Research at Brown University I was awarded an UTRA grant at Brown University to study parts of the sexual behavior genetic cascade in female fruit flies.  I continued this research in an independent study throughout my senior year., Research at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center In the summer of 2003 I worked under Dr. Jeffrey Robbins at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.

Working cooperatively with the Community Director, Minority Peer Counselors, and Women Peer Counselors, RCs strive to create a sense of community within the first-year residential unit.  RCs are generalists and receive comprehensive training on a range of skills, which include active listening, crisis intervention, mediation, conflict resolution, promoting pluralism and diversity, and building community., A Cappella Group The Bear Necessities are an all-male student run a cappella group.  I was in the group from the spring semester of my freshman year all the way through the spring semester of my senior year.  We rehearsed at least 6 hours a week and then had various concerts and traveling gigs throughout the year.  My sophomore year I was tour manager and was responsible for providing lodging, travel, food, and gigs during our spring break tour.  We went and sang at Disneyworld.  My junior and senior year I was business manager and was responsible for the financial and scheduling affairs of the group.  During my time as business manager I managed to get us out of a decade long debt."

    "text": "A broken leg, a routine physical, a mysterious fever--at one time or another, everyone has needed to visit a doctor.  Even though I have had my share of ailments, I have always looked forward to seeing a physician. Dislocating a finger playing football and surviving a serious car accident were frightening moments in my life.  During the aftermath of these incidents, the doctor was the most important person to me.  While I did not heal in time for the next pick-up football game, I had peace of mind.  The doctor was the person who informed me, removing the most worrisome element of my injury or illness: the unknown.  In those stressful times, I looked to one person to tell me what I needed to know.  Through interacting with health care, from the routine to the life-changing, I have decided that I want to be a doctor.  I want to be the one with the answers.  I want what I do for the rest of my life to be significant to me as well as others.  I want to improve people's lives and find merit in going to work everyday.  I choose this path; hoping for my life to never stagnate, to learn continuously and to be an asset to society into my elder years.  Yet, I speak as though I always knew, but I did not begin my path so certain.  I had to first learn what to value before I could learn where that value lay.  As a young boy living with my grandfather, I spent countless hours building anything conceivable from construction toys.  An airplane made of Lego's, a robot made of Erector sets, or even a two foot long praying mantis made of K'nex were trophies of my childhood.  After showing them to my grandfather, an engineer, we would add motors, gears, and drive belts.  He would explain to me how electricity worked, how cars drove, or the folly of building vehicles with eight wheels instead of four.  With this influence, it was no surprise to anyone when I began my college career in engineering.  Considering that my family could offer little financial assistance becoming an engineer appeared a pragmatic choice.  One of the first things I learned in college was that engineering was not what I thought it to be. Working with other students was enjoyable, but the heavy math course load, the lengthy drafting homework, and the devious AutoCAD drove me away.  I discovered that it wasn't just the building that inspired me; it was the learning; it was the work; it was my grandfather.  I liked the construction but also the art involved in creation.  I loved working with my hands but not solely.  I enjoyed the science yet also the people.  Meandering through my first two quarters at school, I settled for mediocre grades.  I had difficulty finding the motivation to learn and therefore succeed. But, during a Fundamentals of Engineering lecture, I had an awakening: I didn't care.  I didn't enjoy what I was learning, and I didn't even want to come back the next day.  Engineering was not for me.  Medicine had appealed to me when I was younger and I began to examine the possibility again.  I liked the challenges that it presented but also the rewards that it offered.  It struck me as science applied to people.  While I sat through that lecture, I discovered that my conception of whom and what I wanted to do with my life were swiftly changing.  I became a pre-medical student that same day.  A born scientist with a social streak; I found medicine to be a perfect fit for my personality.  My 2.9 GPA in engineering became a 3.8 the very next quarter.  Difficult classes were now challenges instead of curses.  I found interest and importance in what I was learning.  Since I wanted to become a good doctor, my foundation in biology or my understanding of organic chemistry became essential.  My grades reflected my new appreciation.  No longer languishing under my engineering responsibilities, I found time to become more involved in extracurricular endeavors.  I began volunteering at the hospital, often experimenting in different positions each quarter to experience multiple sides of health care.  Frequently my time spent there would lead me further.  Following one quarter in the Davis Heart and Lung Research Lab, I began to lend my time to the CMV investigations of Dr. Charles Cook.  Now with a year of work completed, the research is blossoming into a senior honors thesis.  After another quarter in the Neuropsych ward, viewing mentally ill patients come and go (and often go without destination); I decided to become more active in the community.  I campaigned for a student government position, succeeded, and translated my new status into an appointment on a city commission.  Each door opens to new and appealing options.  I've come to identify the essence of a medical career as what I always desired: people and science. I never look back on my decision.  I chose to leave engineering because it was not the career I thought it was.  I decided to pursue medicine because I respect and value what a doctor does.  I want to become a doctor because I found the significance in life which I was lacking.  The fact that I have enjoyed every class and achievement of this path gives me confidence in the fact that I can succeed.  I may never be the engineer my grandfather was but I will always be the man he taught me to be. Morgue Volunteer I assist with autopsies by transcribing, cleaning, and performing other minor meical and non-medical duties.  I work closely with residents and attendings during autopsy., Microbiology Club I attend presentations by various proffessors on their topics of study., Cross-Country Running I began competative track and cross-country running in highschool and, for health and happiness, I continue the habits I learned to this day ., Microbiology Internship I Collect samples from predetermined points in city of Columbus as well as nearby bodies of water; analyze the samples for water processing effectiveness; identify metals, toxins, and microorganisms.

I made decisions about USG direction and bylaws, served on the Student Affairs Committee, and lent time to USG volunteering events., Student Research I research the infection pathway of cytomegalovirus, related techniques, transplant complication caused by cytomegalovirus, and a new antiviral chemical.  I spent one year practicing my techniques, learning new processes, and producing data for experiments.  This time is the groundwork for my Senior Honors thesis; which will eventually cummulate in a defendable paper and hopefully publication.  I have just recently began a small study on GB2 and Actin multiplex PCR.  This is the first step on my larger project.  The technique will be applied an upcoming dosing regiment experiment as well as future experiments.  I also spent one quarter working in the lab of Dr. Xia prior to my involvement in Dr. Cook's lab., Ohio State Hospital Volunteering I Volunteered in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and Neuropsych facility.

    "text": "Medicine has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. At ten months of age, I contracted spinal meningitis and spent over a month recovering in the pediatric unit of the local St. Elizabeth Medical Center. Although I have no recollection of this experience, family members frequently spoke of my illness and of the doctors and nurses who cared for me during this trying time. As a result, I began to develop a curiosity about the field of medicine and about what being a doctor might encompass. I explored this curiosity in medicine through my childhood pastimes including conducting elementary experimentation with a microscope and household specimens and during visits to local science centers with my father. I was fascinated with the human body and enjoyed playing doctor with my toys. Whenever one of my older siblings was sick or injured, I was immediately drawn to the situation, helping care for them as much as possible.     As I progressed in school, my fascination in the impact of medicine on the human body developed into one of my passions. I found myself reading health articles and medical essays whenever possible. I continuously sought experiences that would help me further explore the field of medicine through education and community service. For example, I attended MedCamp, a summer medical experience for rising high school freshmen at the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, excelled in high school science courses, and began volunteering at Tod Children's Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio. In my early volunteer experiences at the Children's Hospital, I spent a few mornings each month assisting with waiting room reading programs, holiday parties, and floor decorating. For the first three years of my attendance at the University of Notre Dame, I continued working in a hospital environment as a student volunteer in the rehabilitation unit at St. Joseph Regional Medical Center in South Bend, Indiana, the Comprehensive Care Center, an HIV/AIDS clinic in Ohio, and in the Emergency Room at Northside Regional Medical Center in Youngstown, Ohio. My volunteer work now entails learning the practices of triage, patient transport, and observing various medical procedures. During my final year at Notre Dame, I intend to continue volunteering in a medical environment, most likely working at the Chapin Street Clinic, a free health clinic, and at the Life Treatment Center, a drug rehabilitation facility, both located in the South Bend community.     These volunteer experiences have helped solidify my decision to pursue medicine as a career. I will actively fulfill my calling to serve others through the ministry of healing. In the future, I plan to serve my community as a physician and caregiver for underserved populations, promoting individual health, community health, and community awareness. I believe that an individual's health is an essential component in the nurturing of one's overall well-being. The likely result of sub-par or nonexistent medical care is poor health, which could affect all other areas of individuals' lives and could result in the degradation of our society. By committing my life to a life of service through medicine, I will be able to help improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable members of society-the poor who often struggle to attain proper medical care. It is this aspect of medicine, providing care for those most in need, which compels me to enter this field.     Along with the development of my passion for medicine, my studies at the University of Notre Dame have allowed me to develop an interest in learning about people. Notre Dame's Arts and Letters Pre-Professional Program has allowed me to study the field of Anthropology along with the required pre-medical coursework. I chose to study anthropology because of its emphasis on the importance of cultural awareness and diversity with respect to individual populations. As a bilingual individual, I understand firsthand the role of a culture in the shaping of one's identity. Growing up in my Slovenian family, I learned to appreciate my heritage and to respect and appreciate the backgrounds of those different from myself. As a doctor, a working knowledge and understanding of the role different cultures play in the lives of those whom I will treat will be vitally important in enabling me to provide the best medical care possible.     I believe that medicine is my life's true calling. I know this from the feeling I experience whenever I begin to talk about life as a doctor, the latest medical discoveries, and health-related issues. It is a result of countless conversations with family and friends, the development of communication skills, and the shaping of a disposition of one who will ultimately serve the community as a doctor. I believe I have the academic ability and discipline necessary to enter the field of medicine. A sincere desire to serve the community motivates me to pursue this life path. While realizing that there are numerous challenges ahead of me in my pursuit to become a physician, I am up for the challenge and am eager to begin my formal medical education. Student Government Committee Member As a member of the Residence Life Committee, I work with other committee members to improve campus life for the students of the University of Notre Dame. During the past academic year, projects I have assisted with included improving the Student Activities Center, organizing Alcohol and Drug Awareness Week, collecting data for the new College Town off-campus project, and assisting with end of the year campus activities. The Committee on Residence Life strives to foster communication between students and University administration to improve the college experience for all those living and working at the University of Notre Dame. Participating in this Student Government activity is an opportunity to improve my leadership skills while also working to serve the student body. I look forward to serving on the Committee on Residence Life during the upcoming academic year., Emergency Department Volunteer As a volunteer in the Emergency Department at Northside Medical Center, I primarily assist the nursing staff in Triage. I am qualified to take patients' vital statistics and assist with patient transport to the various rooms in the ER or to other departments. Whenever invited by the attending physician, I also have the opportunity to observe various medical procedures. Volunteering in this department has exposed me to a variety of different medical conditions and various treatment methods used by the ER staff. It has also allowed me to gain experience working in a fast-paced hospital environment., Peer Advisor As one of forty senior students chosen to serve as a Peer Advisor, I am a student contact for Advising Services in the First Year of Studies at Notre Dame. I meet with First Year students at the University on an individual basis, developing a working relationship and striving to help students succeed during their first year of college. The Peer Advising Program helps facilitate first year students make the transition to college life at Notre Dame by providing advising, academic and other student services, as well as access to a variety of campus resources. It is an honor to serve as a Peer Advisor, assisting students in this unique capacity., Hospital Student Volunteer During the spring semester of 2005, I served as a volunteer on the Rehabilitation Floor of St. Joseph Regional Medical Center in South Bend, Indiana. My weekly responsibilities included re-stocking supplies, filing charts, organizing paperwork, bringing water to patients, and posting the rehabilitation schedule on a large wall chart each Sunday. This experience allowed me to work in a hospital environment, interact with patients, and learn from the staff that provided care for the individuals on this floor. As a result, I improved my communication skills and reaffirmed my commitment to serve others through the field of medicine., Student Assistant During the spring semester of 2006, I served as a student assistant to Dr. Yorke Rowan of the Department of Anthropology. As a student assistant, I aided Dr. Rowan in his research on mortuary practices in the Middle East. I also completed general office tasks, proofread academic papers, graded exams, and worked extensively with Adobe computer programs. This experience allowed me to learn more about the field of archaeology, particularly in the Middle East. I also developed a working relationship with a professor at Notre Dame and experienced learning in a different capacity., Church Festival Volunteer Each summer during the St. Rose Parish Festival, I volunteer in the Lemon Shake Booth run by the women of the St. Rose Altar and Rosary Society. During the four day festival, I spend several hours each evening helping prepare lemon shakes, handling money, and assisting customers in this annual event to raise money for my parish. This is an opportunity for me to remain active in my parish through service. It is also an opportunity for me to further develop my communication skills., Deputy Clerk Each summer, the Girard Municipal Courthouse employs three students each of whom participates in a one-month internship program at the Courthouse. During the month of June 2004, I served as a deputy clerk at the Girard Municipal Courthouse. My responsibilities primarily included completing office tasks in the Probation Department, running errands for the Clerk of Courts, and collecting police reports. I was also able to attend several court sessions and observe the legal system at work in the courtroom of Judge Michael Bernard. Through my internship, I learned about and participated in this particular division of public service., Assistant Manager Every summer since sophomore year of high school, I work at Katie's Korner Homemade Ice Cream to help earn money for college. I began working at Katie's Korner as an ice cream server, assisting customers and preparing orders. In the summer of 2004, I became an Assistant Manager of the Girard Katie's Korner. In addition to waiting on customers, my responsibilities include training new employees, counting register drawers between shifts, assigning evening cleaning tasks, and closing the store on a regular basis. Working at Katie's Korner has helped me develop better leadership skills and the skills necessary to work efficiently and effectively with other employees in a fast-paced environment., Reporter for Branch 55, Slovenian Women's Union of America For the past four years, I have served as the Reporter for Branch 55 of the Slovenian Women's Union of America, in Girard, Ohio. I write bi-monthly reports on branch activities and events for Zarja magazine and attend meetings regularly. Founded in 1926, The Slovenian Women's Union of America is a national organization for women and children that celebrates the Slovenian Heritage in the United States. Members are encouraged to participate in ethnic, cultural, social, and charitable programs, attend monthly meetings in local chapters, contribute to national scholarship funds, promote Slovenian immigrant studies, and participate in the national conventions. My participation in this organization has allowed me to attain greater appreciation for my heritage and to learn about the life stories of other Slovenians living in the United States., Private Tutor For three years, I worked as a private tutor for Joey, a child with Asperger's Syndrome. Twice each week we met to complete homework, study for tests, and strengthen math and reading skills. While completing these academic tasks, I also worked with Joey to help develop his social and communication skills to facilitate his participation in a mainstream classroom environment. Tutoring Joey was a learning experience for me, as I had not previously worked with a child with disabilities. As a result, I developed an awareness and better understanding of the daily challenges an individual with a disability faces while living and learning in our society., Comprehensive Care Center Volunteer The Comprehensive Care Center is an HIV/AIDS clinic founded and staffed by the Ursuline Sisters of Youngstown that serves low-income individuals in Youngstown and the surrounding community. The clinic provides free HIV testing, low-cost medical treatment, counseling, and social services for individuals who could not otherwise receive quality medical care. As a clinic volunteer, my responsibilities included stocking the supply room, organizing patient charts, answering phone calls, filing paperwork, and assisting patients as necessary. This experience allowed me to work with a population that I have had minimal exposure to in the past. During this month of service, I learned about the needs of the HIV/AIDS population in my community and became aware of the daily challenges this population faces. I hope to continue serving the HIV/AIDS population in the future and hope to raise community awareness about the many facets of this disease., Residence Hall President The Residence Hall President is an individual elected by the residents of the hall every spring as a leader in the dorm community. As Hall President of Cavanaugh Hall, my responsibilities included attending weekly meetings with other Hall Presidents during the Hall Presidents' Council, organizing hall events, presiding over weekly meetings in Cavanaugh Hall, and working closely with twenty commissioners in the dorm community, each of whom was responsible for organizing particular hall projects or events. This experience allowed me to work closely with the Student Activities Administration, Hall Staff, campus leaders, and my peers to provide service, social, spiritual, and athletic programs for the residents of Cavanaugh Hall. Working with these individuals helped me develop my leadership skills and learn how to work effectively with others. It was an honor to serve in this position as a representative of Cavanaugh Hall and as a leader in the dorm community., Children's Tutor The South Bend Center for the Homeless provides a variety of services for homeless individuals and families living in South Bend and the surrounding communities. At the Center, guests are encouraged to participate in job training programs, various rehabilitation programs, and community events to help break the cycle of homelessness. As a children's tutor, I worked primarily with kindergarten students who were also guests at the Center. I met with the students twice a week and assisted them with homework, developing reading and math skills, and playing educational games with other children in the tutoring program. I developed friendships with the children in the program and enjoyed listening to their stories whenever possible. This experience helped me grow in my understanding of the challenges and needs of the youngest individuals affected by homelessness. It has also inspired me to participate in other activities to help the homeless in both South Bend and my local community of Youngstown, Ohio., Dean's List This award is granted to the top thirty percent of the students in the College of Arts and Letters at Notre Dame.  I have received this award four times including the Fall and Spring Semesters of the 2003-2004 academic year and the Fall and Spring semesters of the 2005-2006 academic year., Blood Drive Organizer Working closely with the staff at the Central Blood Bank in South Bend, Indiana,  I organized a blood drive held on December 3, 2004 for the Residence Halls located on the North Quad of the University campus. During this blood drive, approximately sixty individuals donated blood to be used as necessary in the South Bend area. This project was an important way to connect students at the University with members of the South Bend community in providing a much needed resource for the winter months."

    "text": "My father, and my inspiration for becoming a doctor, was a compassionate healer.  First in his mind as a physician was the well-being of his patients.  When other doctors were hesitant to care for belligerent or ornery patients, Papa would take the chronic cases that would contribute more to his stress than his income.  His dedication taught me there was nothing that precluded the best care; even the patients caught in their own misery needed a tender hand.  Each patient is not merely a disease wrapped in human flesh, but still a person, even when the pain may obscure sight of all else.  My understanding of this increased during my recent trip to Mexico, where we distributed food in a poor village.  I could see such need in their eyes, but the poverty seemed to be a wall blocking both concern and medical care.  I longed to give them the help they so needed.    My father's anguish over my oldest sister's Hodgkin's disease and his inability to cure her stands out in my memory.  It stirred my spirit, spurring my desire to heal the broken.  I know the pain of a family grimly waiting beside a suffering patient, and I have seen the amazing perseverance of a dying girl.  I have seen my own father's strength falter as he too grew weak from Adenocarcinoma of the liver.  My life has been molded by the diseases of today, and all these things call me to extend my hands to ease the hurt and heal the pain.  I seek to grow so that I can use my strength of knowledge and experiences to treat the body and comfort the mind.  I desire to excel so that I may address suffering wherever it exists.  The need to excel has always been with me.  I continued in my piano studies even when they frustrated me because it was the one area where I could exceed the limited bounds of school.  When I finally reached a point around fifth grade in my piano lessons where my skill blossomed, it was a wonderful feeling to grow as far as my mind and fingers could take me.  At the same point in time, I realized my mind could rise to any challenge when the desire is great enough.  This idea propelled me to the creative competition, Odyssey of the Mind, several science fairs, and the mathematics competition, MathCounts in which I placed 1st in the region and 6th in Ohio.  Such extracurricular activities were the doors to expanding and challenging my mind.  College offered me challenges that I never experienced in high school.  I realized my thirst for knowledge was fueled by these challenges, and the more challenges, the greater desire I had for learning.  Immersion is the best way to grow, and the difficult, advanced biology courses opened my eyes to just how amazing the knowledge is that humanity has.  The profession of medicine will satisfy both my hunger for knowledge and my thirst to comfort the weak and hurting.  I am prepared to enter the rigors of medical school and accept the constant learning environment of a physician.  My life and experiences have given me a drive and desire that will assist in both care of patients and attaining the skills necessary to become a doctor. Hospital Human Resources Clerk Duties and responsibilities are to manage employee files, organize and utilize employee paperwork, interact with archive services, manage the front desk - interacting with employees, directing phonecalls, and assisting people seeking employment, assisting with orientation for new employees, and assisting with company events, including awards ceremonies and ticket distribution.

    "text": "Having spent several years with a rheumatoid condition as a young child, I became aware of doctors and the health care field at an early age. Consequently, I have never had apprehensions about hospitals or doctors since they were so kind to me and helped me through my condition, although at the time I hadn't made that thought quite so distinctly; I just knew that I liked it when the doctor came in and spoke to me. \tThis affinity of mine for doctors might have transitioned into a career choice sooner had my rheumatism not gone into remission when I was 9 years old. After this time I was very healthy and only saw doctors for physicals or vaccinations and generally stopped thinking about health care throughout high school, not being acquainted with any doctors on a personal level.  There were many topics that interested me in and out of school including music, literature, math, cultures, sports, and science. For this reason I had trouble choosing what to study in college, and considered engineering or business. I took an interest in economics and continued to enjoy it until, before I knew it, I was well along in getting my economics degree. Looking back I failed to realize that I was enjoying my math, microbiology, and physics classes even more than economics, but hadn't ever considered them ingredients to a career (I suppose I had become business-minded). My scientific curiosity began to blossom later in college so that I started considering medicine the summer before my senior year, even changing my courses for the fall. But as I considered it over the summer, it seemed more and more formidable: I was behind in classes and volunteering/ research, it would have taken five years to graduate, and few people gave encouragement. I resumed my economics track because at the time my commitment was not strong enough to rise to the challenge. Since then my commitment has grown. I graduated and took a job in research where, after some time, I realized that the corporate world was not satisfying to me. In addition to not enjoying the work enough to excel at it, I felt as though any help that I gave to coworkers, clients, or even the world at large was not causing much impact. Helping others has always taken my mind off myself, and I find that the moments when I am thinking only of myself are, in fact, my worst moments. I have also found that the best thing we can do in this world is try to make the world around you better for everyone in some small way. My service experiences in college had opened my eyes to the satisfaction of meeting unfilled human needs and, without realizing it, I hadn't had my fix in almost a year. Looking for a service opportunity, I began volunteering at an emergency room. My eyes were reopened to the satisfaction of helping others with their most basic needs, and they were opened for the first time to some of the ills of the health care system and people who don't appreciate your best efforts. It's a little bit funny, but I think I realized that I wanted to be a physician just as soon as I learned how difficult it is. The hours in the emergency room went by very quickly as I lost myself in the tasks at hand. And as I meet more physicians I learn more and more about the intangible rewards they receive and the headaches that make the rewards seem even better. It is for these rewards that I have given up the money and security I had to return to school and have a chance at becoming a good doctor. Although my experience in health care and related research is less than the average applicant (due to my late start and my financial situation that has forced me to continue working), I feel that my opportunity to mature and my variety of experiences are just as valuable. Experiences like sailing team, musical theatre, foreign languages, studying social sciences and economics, corporate work, and especially my inner city outreach services and leadership in my service fraternity have exposed me to diverse problems, points of view, and thought processes. I learned in the emergency room that sometimes people just want to talk about something besides their illness for a while. I feel my experience with chronic illness also helps me relate to patients who just want to be able to do everyday tasks without problems or pain.  Since returning to school to fulfill the science requirements, I have found myself more interested than ever in the subject matter in my courses. I truly enjoy laboratory sessions as I observe how things work and react. I often leave biology lecture and ask a friend something to the tune of Did you know that..... Returning to school and studying science and nature has sparked my curiosity to the point that medical school is now looking to be quite fun, although I am not so nave as to think it will be anything like fun and games. I just realize that although there is some practicality in any kind of learning, there will be more and more from here out that is directly applicable, and that is exciting. During that summer where I didn't rise to the challenge, medical school seemed like an inconvenience on the way to a respectable profession. Now it seems like a wonderful part of an exciting and challenging adventure that has begun already and will continue until I retire. Supporting Role in a Theater Production A friend who studied theater told me that they needed more men to audition for a musical, and I found myself with a supporting role.  The time commitment was significant, with rehearsals running from 5-10 on weekdays and longer hours closer to show time. Working with such interesting people (Theatre majors tend to be a different breed) in an aesthetic environment was an excellent experience for me as I was exposed to learning and creating alongside a diverse group of individuals. Working as a team during setup and the time-sensitive scenes was exhilarating and very educational. Many people needed to accomplish a variety of tasks in a specific order, time being of the essence. It was a wonderful team activity., Physician-Shadowing After observing several surgical procedures prior, I was able to see the office aspect of patient care. For a few days, I observed Dr. Kerlakian as he consulted his patients for a wide variety of procedures including hernia repair, gastric bypass, cyst removal, and gall bladder removal. This was incredibly educational, as he was gracious enough to take me aside after each appointment and tell me the significance of the consult and the procedure and how he came to know its necessity. He also told me more of the ins and outs of being a physician than any book can tell. I also hope to shadow my family doctor in the near future., Emergency Waiting Room Liason During this experience I was posted in the emergency waiting room. I assisted patients in check-in with the triage nurse, and helped family members of admitted patients in visitation and information about the conditions of the admitted friend or family member. In addition to these duties, I often found it beneficial to hold conversations with patients waiting to be seen, assuaging some of their anxieties and making sure they knew that they were not forgotten. Occasionally I helped with miscellaneous tasks such as wiping beds, transporting patients, and organizing charts. It was here that I saw the great need for health care that made me want to become a physician. Patients came in and although my words were often fruitful, they often were not and I was left wishing I could do more. I also learned a bit about the problems of the health care system, such as the dangers of using the ER as a primary care physician. I feel that this will help me when I begin my own practice with my own patients., Ohio State University Sailing Team I joined the sailing team as a recreational activity, mostly because I was interested in learning what competitive racing was like after doing some leisure sailing as a teenager. We practiced twice a week in the afternoons and had regattas about every other weekend during the fall and spring. Being a freshman, I was only allowed to race at one or two smaller regattas and often helped run the logistics of the race, such as timing the races, plotting marks on the lakes, and running errands. Through this activity, I learned that often times much work goes into having fun., Professional Data Analyst/ Marketing Research I obtained this job after graduating with my economics degree in 2004. My job duties included writing consumer questionnaires, setting up computer systems for survey administration, analysis of raw data from the surveys, trouble shooting, chart/report creation, and data proofing. As my first full-time professional job, it was a valuable experience in that I was able to conclude that science was what I was primarily interested in after doing work with the DuPont corporation. I was able to improve my computer and analytical skills as well. Ultimately, it was during this job that I also learned that I wanted to work with and help people, rather than work for a corporation., Surgery Observation I was fortunate enough to scrub in and observe several surgical procedures at Good Samaritan. The most exciting one was open-heart surgery to repair an aneurysm in a lower chamber of the heart, during which a heart bypass machine was used to oxygenate the blood after flow was stopped in the heart. I was permitted to stand right beside a surgeon at the table as the two surgeons explained the surgery step by step, allowing me to learn the most about the nuts and bolts of medical care that I had to that point. I learned how complicated some aspects of the surgery are and how simple other ones can be. I also was exposed to how much planning and instruments go into surgery, and why surgery is so expensive for that matter. The experience left me with surgery as one of my options for field of medicine in the future., Capstone Thesis Honors My capstone research paper was written on the state of the German economy after WWI and its role in bringing on WWII. After papers were presented, my professor chose mine to submit to the archives of exemplary capstone papers that successfully integrate a variety of academic disciplines., Surgery Waiting Room Liason My duties were primarily administrative ones, although I had contact with more doctors here than in other experiences. I helped families of surgery patients check in electronically so we could update them as to the patient's status. I coordinated the post-surgery briefings between the surgeons and the waiting loved ones, attempting to streamline the process since the surgeons tend to be busy people. Keeping track of the different operations and their purposes allowed me to learn more about the variety of modern surgical procedures. I was also able to talk to several surgeons and ask them what they like and dislike about their jobs, which was very informative. I plan to continue this work until I leave the city because of all the nice people I meet, as well as my access to surgery observations., Leadership in National Service Fraternity Probably my most valuable experience as far as personal development, I spent three full years in the fraternity. I held office for two of them, including service chair and vice president.       As service chair, it was my responsibility to propose and organize service projects and community outreach, for which I increased member involvement by about 100%. The main service projects included weekly excursions to downtown Cincinnati for rehabilitation of a community/ religious center, and philanthropic projects such as a free campus concert and canned food drives. I was service chair for four semesters.      Although my service chair position was clearly focused outward from the fraternity, I took an inward focus when I became vice president. I chose to work on refining the minds and attitudes of the members as well as turning them into a more cohesive unit. Doing this became more of a diplomatic position in which I just redirected any activities that caused unnecessary strife. As vice president, my duties included running the weekly chapter meetings, sitting on the executive committee, heading up the ethics committee, and general oversight of all committees. My best accomplishments here were reworking the brotherhood meetings and succesfully heading an ethics committee hearing that ended a major crisis., Student Government Judicial Council The Living Unit Commission (LUC) is an option for Ohio State University students facing disciplinary action due to an alleged on-campus infraction. Students may choose to go before the LUC, a committee of peers formed to evaluate and act on student disciplinary situations. After training, we generally met for hearings according to the needs of the university, which was typically weekly or biweekly. After hearing the statements of all students involved, responsibility was discussed and sanctions were issued, always based on the best way to keep such incidents from occuring again. It was a valuable experience because I learned how somewhat simple instances of miscommunication may lead to extreme situations, as most infractions involved minor arguments turning physical. I only regret that I had to leave the commission when I transferred to Miami University."

    "text": "I heard a soft, but urgent knock at the door. Through bleary eyes, I peered at the clock. It was four in the morning. I immediately leapt out of bed and opened the door, remembering the stomach flu was circulating through my building. Matt, one of my residents, was curled up on the floor clutching his stomach in obvious pain. Concerned about Matt, I asked him how I could help. As a Learning Assistant, I was available for any problems that could arise in my residence hall. Matt informed me that another resident was now ill. I followed Matt as he crawled next door where Alice was lying in her bed, sweaty and thirsty. I made Alice and Matt comfortable by filling up water bottles and placing trash cans near their beds in case they got sick later. Unfortunately, I felt powerless to do more.  The stomach flu incident was not a catalyst for my desire to pursue medicine, but it reaffirmed my decision to become a doctor. My interest in medicine was most cultivated in college. During my three year undergraduate education, I undertook a difficult course load and held multiple jobs. My balancing act toppled only during the first semester of my third year. The time I had spent on my jobs often extended past normal hours. I reviewed debate cases at midnight when I had a test the next day, and I counseled residents at three o'clock in the morning when I had class at eight. Because seeing my debate team and residents succeed was important to me, I do not regret these decisions. However, I learned a valuable lesson in time management and priority setting. I started reviewing debate cases after my tests and I began counseling residents after completing my homework. In the spring, I returned to my exemplary academic record, while qualifying two novice debaters to the state championship and maintaining close connections with my residents. Having recognized how to balance multiple tasks more effectively, I am now better equipped to handle the rigors of medical school.  I discovered other important skills when I volunteered as a History Taker at the Free Clinic. I learned to adjust my demeanor to put patients more at ease. One evening, a young man stepped into the exam room wanting an STD test. He looked frightened and apprehensive. Instead of verbally asking questions about his sexual history, I allowed him to answer the questions on the sheet himself. He looked at me with grateful eyes and I gave him a warm, comforting smile. From my work at the Free Clinic, I have realized that sensitive issues need to be treated with tact and compassion in order to create a trusting rapport with the patient.  I further explored my interest in medicine by working as a Research Assistant with Dr. Maria Rojeski at the Medical University of Ohio. There I conducted chart reviews of diabetic patients in a general medicine clinic and in an endocrine clinic. I examined the link between the patients' medication habits and successful diabetes management. Reviewing charts gave me insight into the scientific aspect of clinical practice. I learned medical terminology and the necessary examinations for diabetes patients. However, by observing Dr. Rojeski with patients, I also discovered that medicine is more than the diagnoses and treatments found in charts. One day in the clinic, a woman burst into tears because her life felt so out of control that she could not keep her blood sugar level down. Dr. Rojeski listened sympathetically and helped the patient make manageable changes in her lifestyle. I realized that treatment is not limited to curing medical ailments, but also includes recognizing secondary causes that may impact health decisions and general well being.  By observing Dr. Rojeski, I learned that the skills I have acquired outside of the medical field can be applied in the examination room. Explaining technical terms in simpler language had a visibly comforting effect on patients. I developed similar communication techniques while volunteering at an after school center. I helped a third grade girl, Tai'Mai, improve her reading skills. Sometimes she stumbled on difficult vocabulary words. When the word ripple appeared, I defined and illustrated a ripple with hand motions. Later, when I asked Tai'Mai the meaning of ripple, she mimicked my movements while describing the rings made when dropping a pebble in water. My ability to describe unfamiliar ideas in an easy-to-understand manner will serve me well as a physician.  Now that I have graduated from college, I have committed this next year to volunteering as a nursing assistant at Christ House, a clinic for the homeless in Washington DC. While at Christ House, I will interact with a diverse population and explore the inner workings of health care. I hope to see beyond the idealized version of medical care and instead face the reality of medicine and its limitations.  My experiences have not only confirmed that I want to be a physician, but have also prepared me to make a meaningful contribution to both my patients and the field of medicine. When I become a physician, I will not only utilize what I have learned about nurturing patients, but I will also have the skills to heal the patients' afflictions. Next time the stomach flu races through my building, I will not feel so powerless. Tutor After the debate season ended and I was done coaching, I wanted to continue instructing in some capacity. I volunteered as a tutor at an after school center. I interacted with elementary school children. Most of the time was spent reading with the kids, but some time was devoted to other homework, play activities, and creative storytelling. I learned to have patience and understanding with people who are developing new skills. I felt a sense of accomplishment and joy when the children would give me a big hug and want to read again when I came in., Learning Assistant (LA) As a Learning Assistant (LA) I lived in a first year residence hall and served as an academic mentor for first year students. I directed students to appropriate academic resources and assisted with university programs. Because I was living in the residence halls with students I was always available for concerns and problems. I monitored the environment in the community and its impact on academics. I worked with various student services like Educational Services for Students, the Office of Undergraduate Studies, and the Office of Housing, Residence Life, and Greek Life to ensure that first year students' concerns were addressed. I then planned programs like Study Skills and Time Management to help students cope with the rigors of college. As a leader for first year students, I tried to set a good example for my residents. At the end of the year I was given the Best Supporting Role award by my colleagues and supervisors for my dedication and commitment., Club Member As a member of the Indian Student Association I attended many cultural events. For two years I danced in the annual Diwali show which celebrates an Indian holiday with food and an entertainment show. By dancing, I not only became more cultured and developed lifelong friendships, but I also learned when to compromise and when to speak up and defend my opinions., Nursing Assistant Christ House is a 33 bed residential medical clinic for homeless patients that not only provides medical care, but also serves as a recovery facility. As a volunteer Nursing Assistant I provide care by treating and dressing wounds, assisting with new admissions, and maintaining a neat and caring environment. I am not only learning valuable medical skills but I am also becoming more comfortable working with sick patients. Working with such a vulnerable population I am becoming aware of some of the limitations within health care. The stories I hear at Christ House are heartbreaking, but despite the hardships patients have undergone their attitudes and outlooks are uplifting. I have committed to volunteering at Christ House for one year., Research Assistant I conducted research on the availability of adequate health care for diabetes patients. More specifically my independent project assessed the connection between successful diabetes management and the amount of medications prescribed by a physician. I reviewed charts for HgbA1c levels and the medications taken by the patient. At the end of the internship, I wrote a short paper to summarize my findings. As a side project, I also worked with patients and the researcher to develop effective nutrition assessment tools. I spoke with patients about their diets and utilized many methods to elicit the most accurate description of their food intake. I also helped diabetes patients learn how to count carbohydrates so they could best maintain an appropriate diet. Through the internship I was able to shadow Dr. Rojeski, interact with patients, and learn more about a widespread health concern., Tour Guide I led prospective students and families on campus tours and greeted families at luncheons and other admissions events. As a tour guide, I gained strong leadership skills and learned how to effectively communicate with individuals and with large groups of people., Dean's Honors List I received the Dean's High Honors for the Fall 2003, Fall 2004, and Spring 2006 semesters. I made the Dean's Honor List for the Spring 2004 and Spring 2005 semesters., Media Runner and Security Volunteer I volunteered as a media runner and as a security volunteer at the 2004 Vice Presidential Debate held at Case Western Reserve University. As a media runner I helped media personnel with production and set up. As a security volunteer I checked credentials at the entrances to the venue., Debate Judge and Debate Coach I worked as a debate judge from October 2003 to March 2005. From September 2005 to March 2006 I was the Lincoln-Douglas Debate Coach for University School. As a debate judge I observed high school students in debate rounds at tournaments on the weekends. I critiqued their debating styles and their ability to make logical and persuasive arguments. At the end of each round I selected a winner. As a debate coach I taught high school students the skills of thorough research, effective argumentation, and good sportsmanship. I guided them while they wrote their cases. Cases consisted of a standard by which to judge the round and the arguments the debaters were using to uphold the standard. I helped my students construct solid arguments backed by research and sound logic. I shared in my students' high points and low points and learned to be supportive and firm when necessary. Most of my students were new to the activity, but I helped qualify two debaters to the state championship., Research Assistant I worked in Dr. Lynn Singer's lab on two different psychology research projects. One was a longitudinal study that followed children who were born prematurely and with bronchopulmonary dyplasia (BPD). The children had been in the study from birth to adolescence. The effects of BPD on thinking, language, behavior, and parental distress were examined through the years. On the BPD project, I observed and assisted with testing in addition to reviewing data for entry. I then entered the data and managed the data for completeness. The second study was also a longitudinal study that examined the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on children's learning, language, physical capabilities, and behavior. The children had been followed from birth to age nine. On this study, I worked on my own independent research project. I examined the relationship between academic achievement and behavior in prenatally cocaine exposed children at age six. My research culminated in a poster presentation at Research ShowCASE on April 7, 2005., Habitat for Humanity On the Habitat for Humanity trip in Mechanicsville, Virginia I worked with a team of first year students to build a house for a homeless family. When one of our leaders was called home for a family emergency I stepped up and shared the responsibilities with another leader. As a leader I learned the importance of team building and how to better manage conflict within a group. While building the house, I not only learned new construction skills, but I also learned how to work on a team and communicate more effectively., History Taker The Free Clinic of Greater Cleveland provides free health care to those without health insurance. As a History Taker, I communicated with patients about their backgrounds and current conditions, directed patients to proper waiting rooms, examination rooms, or the laboratory, and alerted the physician to severe conditions that required immediate attention. I took vital signs and charted the patient's condition. I learned about the workings of a community nonprofit health clinic and worked with a diverse population of people."

    "text": "Second semester, junior year. This is one of the most important time periods for a pre-med student, and it's the time that is supposed to be spent researching medical schools and studying for the MCATs. Well, why wasn't I doing just that The answer to that question came in the form of two of my friends, Sam and Hiatt, whose lives altered my carefully structured regimen of planning and studying.     Sam's father passed away in the middle of April, leaving her studies and primarily her life in total disarray. I jumped into action by assisting her through this difficult time and helping to make her transition back to school as easy as possible. I collected information from the classes and workshops that she had missed, and taught the chemistry workshops that she wouldn't be present for. A few days after Sam had left to return home, I was informed that my other friend Hiatt had checked himself into the hospital because of his battle with depression. After talking with him, and discussing his future plans, he informed me that he would not be able to teach his workshops for the rest of the year. I once again offered my assistance by assuming responsibility for one of his workshop sessions.     Up to this point, I haven't made it clear why this period of my life helped to answer the question of why I want to go to medical school. The reason was because of the reaction that other people gave when they learned of Sam and Hiatt's plights, and just how different those reactions were from mine. When our class of teaching assistants was asked by Professor Farrar to help Hiatt and Sam, only one other person, out of a class of fifteen, offered to help. For several weeks, I was shocked at the idea that so many people were unwilling to assist someone else in a time of need. This was not an uncommon reaction, however. When discussing my additional workshops at a staff meeting, one of my staff members confusingly asked, But you're taking the MCATs soon. Why are you helping them This response baffled me, because it appeared that to other people, their definition of wanting to help others came on their terms. I realized that I was so shocked by these reactions because I expected compassion and altruism to be part of their nature, as it was part of mine. This was the moment in my life when I realized that my need to assist others in times of trouble was what set me apart from those other people.     When I first arrived at college, there were many different occupations that interested me. As a result, I sought confirmation that a career as a doctor was what I really wanted. I tried to experience these different occupations by working in a laboratory, working as a teacher, and working as an emergency medical technician. My experiences slowly shaped a clearer picture of my dream occupation in my mind. From these different experiences, I determined that my future occupation would need to include a continuing education. In addition, I also wanted an occupation in which I could assist others in a hands-on fashion.     I spent over 30 hours assisting in fire stations, ambulance stations, and in the emergency department of the hospital. Through these clinicals, I was allowed the opportunity to interact with several different patients in a healthcare setting and this really secured the idea of medicine in my mind. However, I still felt that this occupation was not quite what I wanted to dedicate my life to. The moment that it became clear to me that I would not be happy with the limited scope of an EMT was when I was in the emergency room after treating a patient with diabetic keto-acidosis. I was asking the paramedic, who I was assisting, about the symptoms and underlying causes for a similar affliction, hyperosmolar non-ketotic diabetic coma. When this paramedic, Clay, didn't know the answer, he asked one of the ER doctors. The doctor was also unsure of the answer to this question, and proceeded to leaf through the medical dictionary on his shelf. As he looked up the affliction, he asked, Are you a pre-med student To this, Clay responded, No, she's a pre-EMT student. The doctor replied, That's not a pre-EMT question, that's a pre-med question.     The idea that someone else was able to see that my mind yearned for a more complex understanding of medicine really surprised me. I didn't realize how apparent my curiosity and ambitions were to other people, even before I was clear about my own aspirations. I also didn't realize, until that moment, that I had distinguished myself from the average pre-EMT student by my continuous questioning of medicine.     The thought of becoming a doctor to help others is one of the most common reasons that I have heard people give when asked why they want to attend medical school. Throughout my whole life, I have stopped to help others in need, not taking in account the convenience of the situation. I have come to the realization that this response is of an atypical nature when compared to the responses of my peers. However, my dedication is what drives me, and my desire to help others by caring for them in a medical setting is more than just a desire. It is a need. That is my answer to why I want to go to medical school. Club Sports Representative for the Outing Club I acted as a liaison between the outing club and the club sports committee. This position involved attending monthly club sports meetings, and attending weekly outing club meetings. I also helped plan outing club trips, and would often lead these trips. By the end of the year, I had organized weekly bouldering trips to a nearby climbing gym., Volunteer at Strong Memorial Hospital I chose to volunteer in the radiology department at the hospital because I was interested in the medical field and in laboratory work. However, I did not feel that this volunteer position allowed me to experience either the kind of medical work that I was interested in, or the kind of laboratory work that interested me. These reasons are why I did not choose to continue volunteering in the radiology department., Volunteer in the laboratory of Xin Bi I continued to work in the Bi laboratory on a volunteer basis because although I wished to continue my research, I was not able to work part time in the laboratory. This allowed me to continue with laboratory research although I had a very full schedule.    This also allowed me to conduct an independent research project during my junior year. From this, I determined that I would not be interested in obtaining an M.D./PhD. I did not enjoy working in the laboratory, and I learned that my future occupation would need to allow me to interact with other people on a daily basis., Carl A. Whiteman Teaching Award I received this award for my dedication to my students while working as a teacher's assistant in the chemistry department. I was first nominated my Professor Thomas Krugh, who taught the first semester of general chemistry, then by Professor James Farrar, who taught the second semester of general chemistry. I think this award demonstrates the hard work that I was willing to put in towards helping my students expand their knowledge of chemistry.  This award also opened my eyes to other opportunities like the Teach for America program, which I am currently applying for. I would like to continue to make a difference in the lives of my future students, however, I do not think I would be able to teach the same subjects for more than a few years., Working in the laboratory of Xin Bi I started working in the Bi laboratory because of my interest in biology and lab work. I wished to determine if I enjoyed laboratory research, and if I would be interested in obtaining an M.D/PhD., Teaching Assistant for General Chemistry I taught recitations and workshops for both of the semesters of general chemistry. I taught recitations for a total of about three hours a week. Most of the time that was dedicated to this course was spent preparing either recitations or review sessions. I also spent a few hours a week individually assisting students during my office hours. I really enjoyed working with the students, and I mostly enjoyed being able to see the improvements that certain students made., Honors Organic Chemistry Lab II I worked as a teaching assistant for the honors organic chemistry lab. This lab met twice a week, and also included a weekly lab lecture/workshop. All of the teaching assistants also meet weekly to discuss the preparations which would need to be made for the upcoming week. I also spent about two hours a week preparing chemicals, and preparing the laboratory for the upcoming experiments., Resident Advisor I worked in an upperclassmen floor which represented a challenging experience. I planned hall programs, and assisted my residents with different residential life tasks. This leadership position also helped me learn more about responsibility since I worked as an on-duty resident advisor throughout the school year and for my assigned vacation duty. I also participated in the resident advisor selection process., Honors Organic Chemistry Lab II This experience was different from my experience from the previous year since I was now the only teaching assistant who had previously taught the course. This presented an interesting challenge to me since I was now expected to fulfill a larger leadership role, which was especially important due to the lack of a graduate teaching assistant. I was able to successfully use my previous experiences to help form an effective teaching assistant team., Physical Chemistry Workshop Leader This has been my most challenging teaching assignment so far. This is mainly due to the fact that physical chemistry is a very challenging subject to grasp, and it is especially hard to lead a workshop on the material. However, I am confident that I will be able to meet this challenge successfully because of the time and energy I am willing to dedicate to understanding and teaching the material., Business Manager for the Outing Club This is the second year that I have held an officer position in the outing club, and I am incorporating more rock climbing into the outing club. I am currently working with a local climbing gym to offer a discount to our club members. I started this project as a way to generate more interest for rock climbing at our school., Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Tour to Taiwan This program lasted a little over a month, and allowed me to become better acquainted with my cultural and ethical background. My time was spent traveling around Taiwan, and learning about the historical significance of the various cities and towns. We also learned about the history and culture of the native people., Personal Care Provider/ Homemaker Working as a PCP/Homemaker has enabled me to help people at the homes of people who are no longer to take care of basic needs due to either a mental or a physical disability. Since I have several different clients, I have had the opportunity to learn about different disabilities, and the effects that these disabilities have on the lives of my clients. I have had clients whose disabilities ranged from decreasing coordination due to old age to extreme pain from a car accident. These clients really opened my eyes to the decreased quality of life that can come from several different situations, which I originally would not have considered when thinking about people who have been affected by a medical disability. I enjoyed several of my different tasks like assisting with ambulation and talking to my clients. From these experiences I was able to get to know them and learn about their lives. I also received a great deal of satisfaction in helping people perform tasks that they were no longer able to complete. However, I would much rather help them by using my education of medicine to increase their daily quality of life rather than performing chores around the house."

    "text": "I want to be a doctor because medicine fascinates me, and it fulfills my drive and desire for a life of purpose. From the complexity of the human body to the depth of the experience of suffering, I see so many possible areas of study and opportunities for activism. Our national healthcare system and the global health situation call for reform that must be based on sound knowledge of the determinants of disease and wellness. If I can be trained as an expert and be actively engaged in this profession, I can make a contribution, and above all I want to help.      Initially unsure about pursuing a medical degree, I spent much of my college career studying the societal impact of medicine through seminars with experts in the field.  Through their courses in medical anthropology, the history of medicine, and international disease ecology, and many clinical and research experiences throughout college, I eventually became convinced that I really did want to be a physician.  Immediately after receiving my Bachelor's degree I entered the Post-baccalaureate program at Bennington College to complete my premedical science courses.      Spending the summer of 2004 conducting research with breast cancer patients in Lima, Peru at the Instituto de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN), the only major cancer center in the country, had a major impact on defining my career and educational goals. I had become interested in breast cancer in high school and did clinical research with an oncologist at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine during the summers and school vacations of my first two years as an undergraduate. For my senior honors thesis I wanted to study how social and economic forces in a developing country affected the treatment of a disease with which I was familiar.. Medically, it was an amazing experience in terms of what I was able to observe and learn on a daily basis. In terms of my educational goals, my observations there formed my expectations for my medical education.     First of all, working in a medical environment in a developing country allowed me to see patients with a great variety of rare and very advanced cancers and the struggle to treat them with limited resources. Sixty percent of the 1200 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who come to INEN annually have advanced stage tumors. Patients came to the clinic every day with tumors that had been developing for two years of more, who had only just saved up enough money to travel to the city. Not surprisingly, over half of the patients that begin treatment at INEN do not return for follow-up. INEN's services usually had to be paid for out-of-pocket, meaning that every visit, every dose of chemo, every mammogram presented an economic dilemma for the entire family. The intensity of that level of choice for a patient meant that physicians had to be much more conservative with their care. The history and physical exam were essential, and decisions had to be made quickly and accurately. I spent the majority of my time with the surgical residents. The rigor of the residency program for surgical oncologists reflected this necessity for efficiency and precision, creating an intense and inspiring learning environment.      Observing residents in the midst of what is notoriously the most demanding training program in South America gave me great hope and expectations for my own medical training. The eight residents of the Breast Department worked as a tightly bound team. They worked 18 to 24 hours a day, yet still expressed a passion for their field and their training. I began spending more time at the hospital, joining seven AM rounds, conducting my research interviews during morning consults, assisting in the operating room or with minor surgeries in the afternoon until 4pm rounds, and then staying late into the evening when I had charts to review. I would sit at a desk on one of the wards and watch the hospital life at nighttime: the R1 who had to finish his work-ups for the day's admissions, the R2 who coordinated care with the nursing team, the R4 who oversaw every patient in the hospital, then midnight rounds. Continuously raising new questions, developing the necessary intuition, preparing themselves for their future patients; this was life for these physicians-in-training. A mistake made by an R1 was considered a teaching opportunity for her R2, who evaluated the situation with the R3, who brought in the R4 to gather the team and review the case. In an environment where books are treasures that are passed through many hands and journal articles are often two years late in arriving, the passion for studying, learning and teaching amongst the residents made me appreciate the great honor of being a part of the medical field. I saw medicine practiced as an exact and thorough science yet with profound humanity and respect for the patient. It was enormously inspiring to be part of the team, to experience how medical training can be such a privilege. I came away with very high expectations for my training and for myself.      The community of medicine and the art of patient care absorb me. I am excited to learn about people and the diseases, anatomy, environment, and genetics that affect their health. I want to play a mindful part in this world. Tutoring for children with disabilities For three years I tutored two brothers with special needs.  One had severe developmental disabilities that affected his speech, physical capabilities, and learning.  I learned to communicate with him and to help him complete his school work.  His family uses Applied Behavioral Analysis to improve his symptoms and behavior.  His brother is bi-polar with emotional and behavioral difficulties.  He and I have also learned to work together to improve his academic performance., Poster Presentation Glass EL, Blau R, Heffelfinger S, Lower EE. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) use before, during, and after chemotherapy for breast cancer.  Breast Cancer Research and Treatment. 18:1S, 2004: 6067. Abstract. I was invited to present this abstract in 2004. The previous year I had presented a poster on estrogen and progesterone receptor status and metastatic disease (see publication).  These international conferences bring together over 7000 breast cancer specialists annually to discuss and review current research in the field.  I had the opportunity to meet with many specialists, receive feedback, discuss further research, and attend many interesting sessions., Poster Presentation Glass EL, Hawley DK, Drosick R, Blau R, Lower EE. Complementary and Alternative therapy use by breast cancer patients. Journal of Clinical Oncology. 22: 14S, 2004: 8136. Abstract. This meeting draws over 30,000 oncologists to discuss their research.  I was able to meet with many physicians and attend some exciting sessions in a variety of fields.  The poster presentation was a great opportunity for discussion, feedback, and ideas for collaborative projects., Summer camp Director I developed and co-led a summer recreation program, including tutoring and local outings, for children with learning disabilities on this small island with limited resources., Cum Laude honors I graduated with cum laude honors due to my 3.65 GPA and the successful completion of my senior honors thesis.  My grades also earned me Dean's List recognition for 3 semesters., Trail Leader and Steering Committee member I helped develop and institute the school's first pre-orientation backpacking program.  In August 2003 I led 8 incoming freshmen on trail.  Then in 2003-2004 I sat on the Steering Committee, helping expand the program's focus on social justice and develop a new leader training program that included wilderness skills, group dynamics workshops and crisis intervention., Clinical Research I initiated and led two studies in clinical oncology.  I was extremely involved throughout the entire process, from developing my own instrument to presenting at international meetings. I gained skills in the clinical encounter, chart review, data entry, and statistical analysis.  The first project concerned the differences in estrogen and progesterone receptor status between primary and metastic breast tumors.  In the second project I examined women's use of complementary and alternative medicine before, during, and after chemotherapy for breast cancer (see presentations and publications)., Surgical Oncology Internship and Research I participated in clinical examinations, floor rotations, and observed in 100+ surgeries.  I interviewed 140+ patients for my Senior Honors Thesis, Breast Cancer in Peru: Treatment Choices in a Medically Pluralistic Society., Citizen of the Year I received this award in recognition of volunteer  activities with the Community Partnership for Awareness regarding adolescent drug and alcohol usage., Hoopes Research Fellowship I was the first recipient of this fellowship awarded by the Office of Undergraduate Research.  The committee reviewed the work that I completed for my Senior Honors Thesis and then sponsored my continuing research in Peru in the winter of 2005-2006.  With this award I was able to continue my work in Complementary and Alternative Medicine use by breast cancer patients.  I conducted research on several medicinal plants, including Annona muricata, which I was later able to study and present for my organic chemistry research project at the Bennington College Post-baccalaureate program.  This plant was used by 40% of all breast cancer patients whom I interviewed for my thesis.  I also travelled to Iquitos, Peru where I worked with experts at their Medicinal Plant Research Center at the University of the Amazon.  My work in Peru was overseen by Dr. Martha Villar, head of the National Program in Alternative Medicine.  I was also able to asisst her with an on-line directory of the medicinal plants of Peru and their prescribed uses., Journal Article Lower EE, Glass EL, Bradley DA, Blau R, Heffelfinger S. Impact of metastatic estrogen and progesterone receptor status on survival. Breast Cancer Research and Treatment (2005) 90: 65-70., International Activities Fund for Undergraduates Monetary grant supporting international field research leading to a Senior Honors Thesis.  This grant covered my second trip to Peru in December of 2004.  On this trip I was able to conclude the research I had started the previous summer.  This included working with breast cancer patients who had chosen not to pursue conventional care.  I was able to travel to the city of Cajamarca where I met patients and observed several traditional healers., Beyond Tourism Essay Contest My essay on my experiences volunteering in Mexico was selected for first prize out of over 500 essays.  The prize included travel and monetary awards as well as publication of the essay at www.beyondtourism.com., Treasurer and Trip Leader Treasurer, 2003-3004.  I was responsible for managing a $10,000+ budget, purchasing gear, funding wilderness excursions, organizing wilderness medical training courses, and organizing major fundraising events. Trip leader, 2002-2005.  I led various weekend trips and taught outdoor skills workshops including winter survival, basic map reading, and wilderness first-aid., Clinical Research Coordinator While in Peru I spent several weeks working with this American foundation whose goal is to develop and test non-toxic, cost-effective alternative therapies.  I helped with a pilot study of an electromagnetic device used to treat patients with congestive heart failure.  My volunteer work included chart review, coordination with the staff at the Heart Institute of the Seguro Social Hospital in Lima, Peru, and translation of all medical meetings for the foundation's site visits.  I also helped plan their expanded clinical trial for this same device, as well as its application for patients with cancer.  We also began the project proposal for a clinical trial of a plant, Uncaria tomentosa, which is being investigated in patients with HIV."

    "text": "The ache had grown steadily worse, a dull to sharp throbbing pain, pulsing back and forth between my temples, each footstep setting off a new cycle.  Breath came in short gasps at 4824 meters above sea level. When I emerged from the dark mine entrance an explosion of dazzling sunlight assaulted my eyes and elevated the agony in my head to a whole new level. I was suffering from soroche, altitude sickness.  Before long I was surrounded by concerned indigenous Bolivian women from the nearby market who took me under their care to minister me with native remedies.  I was told to lie down flat, then they proceeded to cover my face with thin sliced potatoes to draw out the pain they told me.  The cooling relief was immediate, and soon I was well enough to sit up and sip the green coca leaf tea they offered me.  I was just 8 at the time, but this incident had a profound impact on me; it set me on a lifelong path to pursue a vocation in care giving and medicine.  Prior to this occasion, I had been blessed with a relatively pain free life; when needed I would run to my mother to provide a Band-Aid for a scraped knee or small cut.  For the first time I became aware of the truly revolutionary powers of timely medicine; of how deeply it can impact and comfort an individual.  I decided at this point that there could be no more gratifying way of spending my life than pursuing a career in medicine and coming to the aid of those in pain, just as I had been helped.    My interest in medicine also stems from my upbringing.  My family moved frequently during my formative years, evenly distributed between the United States and Bolivia.  In the U.S. I would see the marvels of modern medicine continually grow, while in Bolivia there are still frequent mortalities from such curable ailments as giardia, cholera, and common infections.  My life took me to places where I had a firsthand view of the devastation that the lack of medical services can wreck on the lives of those underprivileged and under-serviced. Witnessing the destructive force of sickness gave me the impetus to seek a role in combating it.    This abiding interest in medicine has been reconfirmed for me several times over the years as I became engrossed with natural sciences in my studies.  I chose to enroll in college as a human nutrition major, seeking the best background education to set me on a trajectory towards the field of medicine.  It seems that many of the prevalent illnesses of our day are nutritional in nature, and so I have taken a great interest in this field of study.  Medicine is the ultimate service field.  Throughout my life, service has been modeled by my parents and other international aid workers whom I look up to.  Their nurturing influenced my development, cementing service as one of the cornerstones of my character.  Helping those in need is the most important thing I can do with my life, and through medicine I will be able to pursue this on a daily basis while capitalizing on my great love and aptitude for the natural sciences. I love medicine for the depth of the profession, drawing and building on a vast pool of knowledge and experience that is never stagnant. I see myself as a lifelong learner, someone who is prepared to spend the rest of my life in the pursuit of knowledge and its applications.

    "text": "When I was very young, I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I grew up.  I wanted to be a carpenter and an inventor. I loved working with my hands to design, build and fix all sorts of items.  This desire to build and fix led to a driving force to know.  With a full ChildCraft book set at my disposal and parents willing to read to me, I inquired about the workings of everything I came into contact with.  I did not know this process as science, but the need to analyze and adjust only grew stronger as I grew older.  Though I still find infinitely many areas of study to be interesting, the majority of my curiosity has been clearly focused on science and medicine since sometime before junior high.   \t I still ask questions, but my obsession is not limited to learning.  I find it equally fascinating and rewarding to share what I have learned with those around me.  I thrive on the challenge of explaining the research project I work on to people who are not even in the field of science.  Informing a person about my research may be interesting, but it is not often pertinent to his day-to-day life. In medicine, an explanation can mean far more. A certain level of comfort comes with knowing what is wrong in one's own body. Additional comfort can be gained through understanding the basic science behind one's treatment. \t Medical school will allow me to link all of my passions.  It will bombard me with a plethora of interesting information delving deeply into the workings of the human body.  If I choose to specialize in surgery, I will be able to work with my hands to fix and build in or upon the human body.  Possibly most important of all, medical school will allow me to help people by listening to their questions and using what I have learned to help them understand the answers.  \t Countless individuals have reminded me about the difficulty of medical school.  I hope for nothing less. I never want to do any job below my highest capability.  The challenge of medical school will push me to a level beyond what has ever been expected of me before. I am ready to go to the next level. I want to have much expected of me, and I look forward to meeting that challenge.   Above all, I still want to know. When someone comes to me and asks, Why does my body do this I want to have an answer. Requiring long hours of study, biochemistry was among the hardest classes I ever took. When the course started, there were seven students enrolled.  In the end, only three of us remained. The course was difficult, but I enjoyed learning the information my body must know every time I take a breath or eat a meal. I can only imagine how much more information I will be given in medical school. \t Fixing a car that will not start or building a new wall in a house can be very rewarding. I cannot imagine how much greater it must feel to replace a failing organ, or reconstruct the face of a small child born with birth defects or bludgeoned in an automobile accident. I remember the first time I read about hand transplant surgeries in Popular Science.  I though, Wow! How does anyone make so many specific and minute attachments I further wondered about the thoughts in the mind of someone who has just felt with a hand that has been gone for years.  People's lives are changed every day by the work of physicians and surgeons.  I cannot think of a better way to put my creative building enthusiasm to use.  \t Fixing the symptoms of a disease can often leave patients with the mental anguish of unanswered questions.  Many treatments bring about negative side effects that could make the patient believe he is not being healed at all.  Often, patients just wish their doctor would take the time to listen to them. As a doctor, I will make a point to explain my patients' conditions and treatments to them. I know the time of a physician is limited, but that only increases the challenge of explaining to patients. Anything that forces me to become a better doctor will be a welcomed challenge.   Posing a unique challenge to explain, obstetrics is one field I find particularly interesting.  Most people go to the doctor with problems in need of remedy.  In these cases, the doctor is explaining a situation that both he and his patient wish were not true.  Obstetricians have a rare opportunity to explain a positive condition to a person who is often eager to learn.  I cannot think of a more exciting time to be involved in the life of another than at the birth of a new child.  I would not attempt to choose a specialization without first having rotational experience in many fields, but I look forward to a rotation in obstetrics.  \t Medical school will allow me to blend all of my interests into one rewarding career.  I will enjoy channeling my passions to help those in need.  In a single career, I will be a builder, a learner, and a teacher.  A medical school education will provide me with the tools I need to be my best. IDeA Conference I attended workshops and seminars on topics ranging from Presentation Skills to proteomics and the female reproductive system.  I also presented a poster I coauthored on the benefits of a sustained research experience for undergraduate students., First Biennial IDeA National Symposium I coauthored and copresented the following poster at a national conference:  R.D. Shurina and P.A. Hartman. 2006. The Influence of Summer Research on the Career Choices of Biology Students at Wheeling Jesuit University.  First Biennial IDeA National Symposium, WV-INBRE- COBRE Research Symposium I was a coauthor on the following presented poster:  B.M. Fenner, R. J. Wakim,  M. Sirage, M. Hartzell , P. A. Hartman,  J. D. Homan, C. Starkey, K. Lopez, K. Koral and R.D. Shurina. 2005. Undergraduate Biomedical Research at Wheeling Jesuit University.  WV-INBRE- COBRE Research Symposium., Church Choir I was a volunteer member of the 9PM mass church choir at Wheeling Jesuit University.  We met once a week to practice for aproximately 2 hours.  We also practiced for one hour before church each Sunday and sang in one mass each week., Resident Assistant I was responsible for a hallway of residents.  I had one duty night each week during which I could not leave the building from 6PM to 8:30 AM.  During that time I was responsible for dealing with any situations that arose in our building and sitting the front desk for the first 2 hours (6PM-8PM).   I also had several duty weekends a semester during which I had duty nights on Friday, Saturday, and, during first semester, Sunday as well.   As Resident Assistant, I was also responsible for maintaining order on my hall, in my building, and anywhere else I happened to be on campus when trouble occurred., Williamson Water Study I worked full time on a grant from the company Altria studying contaminated water in Williamson, WV.   In Williamson, many people had no access to city water.  The well water had been contaminated sometime around the mid 1980s.  We took metals and coliform samples at wells, streams, ponds and the river in an attempt to trace the contamination to its source.  While the data analysis for this project is still incomplete, the media attention drawn to the town by our efforts caused the Governor of West Virginia to mandate and fund the extension of city water to the houses with contaminated wells., Public Speaking My wife and I spoke at a Gabriel Project Benefit, a Students For Life meeting, and an Ethics Class on the issue of abortion.   When my wife became pregnant, she was on Dilantin, an anti-epileptic drug known to be teratogenic.   Her doctors attempted to persuade her to have an abortion.  We did not give in to their persuasion, and our daughter was born perfectly healthy and devoid of any detectable abnormality.   The Gabriel project is a non-profit organization devoted to helping needy mothers and children.   Students For Life is Wheeling Jesuit University's right-to-life club.  The ethics course we spoke at was a 300 level philosophy course taught by Beverly Whelton.  We shared our story to these groups with the intent to provide strength to others in their attempts to hold steadfast to their beliefs in the face of opposition., Laughlin Chapel after-school program One day a week I went to the Laughlin Chapel to volunteer in an after school program.  Most days, I worked with the kindergarten students assisting them with their homework, reading books with them and playing games.  I really enjoyed this opportunity to act as a teacher and role model for underprivileged children., WV-INBRE Research Symposium Our lab presented three posters at this research symposium.  I was the primary author on the following poster: Hartman, P.A. ,B.L. Venci, M.J. Porta, B.M. Fenner, D.C. Flynn and R.D. Shurina (2006). Generating an Antennapedia-GFP-AFAP Fusion Protein to Determine the Role of AFAP-110 in Angiogenesis. Presented at the WV-INBRE Research Symposium, Morgantown, WV, August 3, 2006.  I was the second author on the following two posters:  Venci, B.L ,  P.A. Hartman, B.M. Fenner, D.C. Flynn and R.D. Shurina (2006). Creation of  Membrane Permeable Fusion Proteins using Antennapedia and the Green Fluorescent Protein in the pGEX Fusion Protein Vector. Presented at the WV-INBRE Research Symposium, Morgantown, WV, August 3, 2006. \t Porta, M.J., P.A. Hartman, B.M. Fenner, D.C. Flynn and R.D. Shurina (2006). Internalization of Antennapedia-AFAP-110 and Its Effects on Endothelial Cell Morphology. Presented at the WV-INBRE Research Symposium, Morgantown, WV, August 3, 2006., AED Honors Society Our official induction into the AED pre-health professional honors club will occur in the fall of 2006.  Last year, we worked to become an official chapter of AED., President of Students For Life Students for Life is the name of the right-to-life club at Wheeling Jesuit Univesity.  We held weekly meetings, hosted speakers, and attended a right-to-life march.  Our organization promoted the human right to freedom from unnatural death., 18th Street Center Volunteer The 18th Street Center is a Catholic charity organization.   One day a week I went to the 18th Street Center and bagged donated groceries and served dinner for the homeless and hungry of Wheeling., BBB Biology Honors Society Though officially inducted in May of 2006 at the end of the school year, I participated in BBB throughout the 2005-2006 acedemic year., American Association for Cancer Research Annual Conference While employed under an NIH grant for angiogenesis research, I attended the American Association for Cancer Research Annual convention.  I found it thrilling to be given the oportunity to speak with experts about their work.  Often textbooks leave one wondering about unclear points or subjects delved into only briefly.  Speaking with the people who write textbooks and do the research I had previously only read about was a wonderful experience., Angiogenesis Researcher Working 15 hours per week during the school year and 40 hours per week in the summer, I designed and executed experiments in cellular and molecular biology.  I also attended conferences and presented our work on published posters. This research experience taught me what real research is.  In a lab course, the experiment is designed to be nearly fail-proof.  In this job, I spent almost a year attempting to create three vectors and their fusion proteins in a bacterial system only to be thwarted by a premature stop codon.  Real research does not always work out the way it should.  However, enough failed experiments can provide one with the open mind and insight necessary to see where changes must be made to break through a proverbial roadblock.   I also believe there is no better way to truley understand a system or process than to watch it fail and search for the reason why.  Due to the amount of time I spent learning about the science behind our equiptment and procedures, I was even allowed to train incoming student researchers and manage the lab while the professor in charge of the grant was away."

    "text": "Eager hums and whispers fade as the conductor lifts his arms in preparation of the first powerful stroke, the very movement that vivifies the words and music of Verdi, Puccini, Offenbach or Mozart. Suddenly, life returns to the theatre as the musical life blood fills the hall. The overture has begun, soon to be followed by the singers and actors of the stage. I smile, knowing I have a special connection to this stage, to its life: my parents are the stars. This unusual upbringing cultivated my appreciation for humanity, and ultimately, I believe that having opera singers for parents taught me to lead a life of passion, integrity and leadership. So naturally, I want to go to medical school.   Music challenged me to acknowledge the melody of sciences during the overture of my life. I found myself entering state science fairs by the eighth grade, and then taking advanced science courses in high school to satiate my love of the biological world. These activities were a mere prelude to pursuing a Chemistry degree in college. I researched in the organic chemistry lab, synthesizing compounds that may be useful for future AIDS medication. But as fascinating as I found the work, a crucial part of my life dream remained missing: people. I quickly developed a love for Anthropology and traveled to India to study the Tibetan culture and research the Tibetan treatment of type II diabetes. These opportunities strengthened my understanding of the sciences and continuously sparked my interest in medicine and culture. Experiences magnified my passion for medicine, but people impel me to attend medical school. Throughout high school and college I have volunteered in medical clinics in Haiti and Uganda, worked with elderly in Mexican nursing homes, and orphans and underprivileged children throughout the USA, India and the aforementioned countries. Taking blood pressures, working beside doctors and meeting patients, I fulfilled the practical role of observer and aid, but the pinnacle of my experiences occurred in the city of Jinja, Uganda.  The day I visited the children's hospital of Jinja, I heard the melodies of desperate families awaiting some kind of help. I had seen poverty and disease, but here these bitter notes, expressed through mothers sleeping on straw mats beside their infants and young children hoping to overcome the worst diseases, revealed the impact a doctor can have; an impact I want to have. I spent most of my time working with HIV infected and abandoned babies. This experience challenged me to interact with families without cultural bias and to try to understand the needs and goals of a world very different from mine. I met Stephen, an extremely malnourished eleven-year old, incapable of smiling or walking and afflicted with TB. He shared his coloring book with as much enthusiasm capable, as I stood at his bedside sharing a smile. Then there was the lovely Immaculate whose eyes sang of compassion as if she were a humble diva in her remarkable ability to understand and empathize. This child, paralyzed from polio, gazed at me from her metal barred hospital bed, looked away from her coloring books, and extended her hand in greeting and friendship. She continued to look directly at me and smile. If eyes are indeed a gateway to the soul, at that moment, I felt Immaculate stare through my eyes as if revealing the mysteries of life. I want to help these families that revealed to me a greater appreciation of life; to help the children with AIDS, cancer or the common cold; to make a difference using my love for people and my fascination with science. Recently, receiving news that one of the babies in my care at the orphanage passed away, I immediately felt the loss and realized the situation could be the first of many. I may just be waiting for news of each passing HIV baby I had the honor to care for and love. Through the heartache of this situation, I recognized that to go blindly into medicine thinking that everyone will live long and full lives could result in overwhelming disappointment. With this understanding I remain undeterred in my aspirations. In these moments I am reminded that I want to pursue medicine to try the best I can not only to save lives, but improve life; to learn and experience the preciousness of life; and to live the best life I could possibly fathom by working as a doctor. Shakespeare once wrote, All the World's a stage,/ and all the men and women merely players; through our experiences and relationships, each of us has a role in the opera, and just like my parents walking beneath the lights of the stage to perform an aria, or Immaculate's inaudible bittersweet songs beneath the lights of a deteriorating hospital ward, or the surgeon performing an Appendectomy, we can sing our passions and talents in our lives. When my curtain rises, I hope it reveals my perseverance and dedication to improve life through medicine. Service Fraternity Alpha Phi Omega is a service fraternity that works: to organize service opportunities for the community, such as aiding at a local homeless shelter or cleaning yards for the elderly; to develop helpful philanthropic fundraisers; to build friendships and strengthen leadership.  I've participated in Relay for Life the past three years and I've participated in helping the Oxford Community Family Center organize clothing, helped with the Bluegrass Festival Uptown for the past two years, and several other campus and community needs. The fraternity strives to serve while facilitating a strong social network., Home Health Care Aid As a home health care aid, I would go to patients' homes to help. My training allowed me to work with the patients by helping with stretching techniques, reminding them to take medications, and helping the patient with various household tasks and personal hygiene. All the patients that I worked with were above 65 years old, and had a variety of difficulties ranging from blindness and diabetes, to severe dementia. I remember during my training feeling slightly intimidated by the thought that I would be spending one on one time for several hours with these patients, bathing them, cleaning for them, interacting with them.  The very first time I bathed a patient was difficult, but I quickly learned how to balance hygiene care and the proper amount of respect. This job was difficult, but the lessons I learned with the patients including building a better rapport, made it extremely beneficial., Haiti Medical Clinic During the summer after my junior year in high school, my school offered the opportunity to volunteer in Haiti. I worked as a small group leader, organizing meetings and activities for a summer school the entire group helped run. The area we visited was a small city known as Ouanaminthe, just across the Dominican border.  Our other activities included helping with construction of classrooms and offering a medical clinic. The village had a single doctor, so our clinic was extremely popular and needed several volunteers in our group to assist the volunteering doctors. This gave me my first opportunity to work with doctors, helping by taking blood pressures and distributing vitamins. The doctors included us in the physical exams of patients and allowed us to listen to heartbeats and the breathing of patients with bronchitis as well as showing us more unique cases with men, women and children that aren't seen very often in the USA. The experience enhanced my leadership skills and taught me about medicine from a very unique perspective., Habitat for Humanity For Spring Break my senior year of high school, my AP US History teacher organized a group to spend the week in Lexington, Kentucky, to work on building a house. I remember feeling the excitement being amidst friends, but also, I was one of the only students that had already turned 18. This meant that I could use power tools. The use of power tools enabled a wide range of freedoms, greater productivity as well as giving me the chance to work as a leader. My group worked together to frame walls, post dry wall, place shingles on the roof and various other tasks. The trip not only taught me the basics of house construction and repair, but developed my understanding of team work., Undergraduate Summer Scholars I conducted independent research on the affect of stereochemically altered catalysts and the kinetic rates and yields associated. Though I was unable to publish the work, I felt my appreciation for lab workers and researchers increase. I also developed greater independence in my personal life. This experiece has had an imperative role in my personal maturation., Campus Crusade for Christ I lead a Bible study through this organization, as well as sing in a worship band for a Campus Wide Prayer event that includes all the Christian organizations on campus.  I also participate in a Bible study led by another student.  The movement as a whole is committed to reaching out to other students and becoming actively involved in and off campus.  Volunteer opportunities, leadership positions, friendships and growth are all aspects very important to the organization.  Being a Bible study leader requires me to be a mentor for several girls and offer advice and friendship while committing myself to remaining a role model for the girls., Bank Teller I spent two summers after highschool working as a teller in the First Merit Bank. I cashed checks, helped customers with credit information and ran several transactions that introduced me to the world of debits and credits, loans and investments. In a subjective manner I was to help customers by referring them fo products they may find useful. As a teller, I got to know people on a personal level through consistent visits to the bank. By the end of my time at First Merit, I felt like a part of the community. Families would invite me to see highschool football games, or join them at a neighborhood party. It was a wonderful way to get involved with the community., Organic Chemistry Lab Research I worked under Dr. Gung's supervision for second semester of my sophomore year, over the summer and then the first semester of my junior year. The beginning of my research taught me lab skills as I would repeat reactions for graduate students and then perform spectroscopy to determine the purity of my results. I learned how to use the NMR, IR and various laboratory tools necessary in Organic Chemistry research. The experience also taught me to appreciate research from a practical level. It is a tedious job that requires detailed observations, cleanliness and patience, all of which are areas in my life that I saw improve., Observing at Rainbow Babies Hospital In the summer of 2006, I had the opportunity to observe in the pediatric oncology and hematology unit of University Hospitals in Cleveland. Throughout the day I was able to see the laboratory facilities, exam rooms and offices where I met several nurses, doctors and patients. Shadowing Dr. Jacobson was particularly educational. I was able to go with him to observe doctor-patient communication and rapport. He discussed treatment possibilities and the option of a clinical trial with the patient and her family. Watching his mannerisms, listening to the way he spoke with the patients, and watching the patients interact with him, was very insightful. I was also able to talk with several children and families that had come to receive chemotherapy, which also proved educational medically by exposing me to administration techniques to which I was unaccustomed.  Seeing how patients, nurses and doctors interact with one another was one of the most rewarding aspects of observing that day with their demonstration of communication, respect and medical expertise in a field that greatly interests me., Volunteering in Ugandan Orphanage In the summer of 2006, I traveled solo to Africa to volunteer at an Orphanage called the Amani Baby Cottage. Planning the trip had begun the previous fall, just with an email to the director of the orphanage, expressing my interest in helping. Things came together remarkably well and in June I flew to Africa. The orphanage is home to just over 60 infants through toddlers all needing medication and stimulation. Volunteering allowed me to work with AIDS/HIV orphans, severely disabled and abandoned children and to see an area of the world in dire need of medical aid and education. Most days were spent feeding and caring for the infants, or taking infants for necessary medical treatments at the nearby clinic.  I also spent a day at a disabled children's clinic in a smaller village outside of the city. There I helped the doctor review patients in desperate need of surgery and physical therapy. My experiences in Uganda showed me how to appreciate a culture so different than my own and facilitated my growth as an independent individual by travelling alone., Resident Assistant Taking on the tasks of a dormitory resident assistant was a great decision.  I worked with six other RA's to provide the hall with educational and social programs and to promote safety. About 200 students occupied Swing Hall, 20 of which were in my corridor specifically. With these girls I provided a listening ear and conversation, programs, an information bulletin and reminders of alternative activities on campus. RA requirements included two programs a month and duty nights, which involved remaining in the building to help residents from seven at night till seven in the morning. Most of my resident interactions were done beyond those requirements. I attended events with residents, provided them with resources and offered assistance. The staff also grew close and encouraged one another as a family. I learned a lot about leadership as a resident assistant, including the advantages of working as a team. To be a good leader does not mean to be everyone's friend and in some circumstances, I had to make difficult decisions, such as whether or not to call the police at the smell of marijuana in the dorm or how to confront image obsessed and possibly bulimic students about poor choices. An RA needs a creative and open personality  and willingness to lead students while maintaining integrity in the community., Culler Award This award was granted for my work in Physics. It included a scholarship from the school at the conclusion of my Physics course. To me, this award demonstrates the old cliché, if at first you don't succeed, try try again. I had taken second semester, calculus based Physics the year prior, but near the end I felt that I had not developed the level of understanding I would have liked. So I took a chance and dropped the course. I knew that by dropping the course I made sure that I would take the course again and work with even greater diligence. Second semester of my junior year had its challenges preparing for the MCAT, taking my senior capstone course, organizing a trip to Africa, and several other time necessary challenges. With all these pressures, I worked harder.  With each new challenge, I sought to do my best. The Culler Award may be an award for academics, but for me, it reveals that hardwork and proper time management skills promote success., Ski Club This has been a fun hobby since I was about 13 years old when I first started skiing. By my senior year in highschool, I decided to start snowboarding as well. I love the sport and the chance to enjoy the winter weather. In the winter of 2005, I decided to join the Miami University Ski Club and went snowboarding in Steamboat, Colorado., Halaqa This was a unique opportunity I had to befriend and discuss issues with Muslim students around campus.  The first few weeks were more informative about the state of Islam today, what they believe, such as what the Q'uran is and who Mohammed was.  After that, the group would send specific emails of what the discussion topic to be addressed each week would be.  We discussed global and national ethical issues as well as issues we face on a daily basis. The main reason I joined the group was to gain a greater cultural understanding of my friend, Ivana. We both worked as RAs in our college dorm and I knew I would understand her better if I understood this part of her life."

    "text": "In the middle of the Arizona desert, I was on cloud nine.  I had just completed five grueling hours of interviews for a position at a preeminent technology company and was confident in my performance.  Since I still had a few hours before my return flight, I thought it would be a good idea to check out the area that could perhaps become my future home.  I wandered through a neighborhood market, trying to gain a sense of the local culture while still decompressing from my stressful morning.  Feeling light as air, I was suddenly brought back to reality by an unusual sound.  Turning around, I noticed an elderly woman struggling to breathe, indicating with her hands that she was choking.  I quickly attended to her, eventually performing the Heimlich maneuver to clear her air passage so she could regain her breath.  I helped her to find a place to sit down and she quickly thanked me, embarrassed by the crowd that had gathered around us.  I made sure she was alright and then walked away:  saving her life took from cloud nine to the moon! I have always hoped that I might someday have the opportunity to experience this same satisfaction in my chosen career.  As the daughter of a physician, I have always admired my father's adeptness and goodwill when responding to people in need and have been fortunate to witness his talents firsthand.  From tending to a broken arm on the soccer field to helping me cope with meningitis in college to shadowing him while he implanted a stent or visited patient rooms, he has always displayed not only the expertise of a trained physician, but also the compassion of a life of service.  Regardless of the hours his cardiology practice demands, the decisions he faces, or the family sacrifices he makes, his love for medicine is undeniable.  His dedication has been a motivating factor for four of my siblings to enter the field of medicine as well.  His guidance and encouragement through each of my educational, professional, and personal decisions have been invaluable to my development.  While studying at Notre Dame, he helped to instill in me an appreciation for the changing face of health care and the increasing need for a physician to also have a sound understanding of business.  Upon completion of my undergraduate degree, I sought to develop a business acumen by earning a master's degree in business administration from The Ohio State University. While I did receive an offer as a senior analyst at that technology company, after business school I opted for a unique opportunity with a venture capital firm in Chicago specializing in early-stage financing for upstart biomedical and technology companies.  I was excited about the position because it was a perfect union of my undergraduate science studies and my business graduate degree and offered insight to a new facet of medicine.  My work entailed evaluating proposals:  from protein informatics and semi-conductor manufacturing to drug delivery and digital media solutions, I presented the viability of the ideas to the firm's partners and board of directors.  The experience I gained strengthened my research skills and critical/rational judgment, while also reinforcing my confidence in decisive situations.  My current position as an investment banker has developed my understanding of how non-profit and government agencies function as well as how to improve their fiscal operations through more economical funding or refinancing opportunities.  The analytical and personal skills that are required for success in this field as well as the service aspect of assisting non-profit institutions, such as hospitals and universities, are invaluable assets that I will take with me in my future career in medicine.   After discussing my educational and professional progression with medical school admissions directors, I relocated to Philadelphia to attend the University of Pennsylvania as one of fifty students selected for its Post-Baccalaureate Pre-Health Special Science Program.  Penn's educational and medical resources provided me with the opportunity to take upper-level courses in the natural and physical sciences (such as cellular biology, neuroscience, and biochemistry) within the University as well as gain clinical exposure through its prominent hospital network.  I have continued to work as an investment banker to support the financial cost of my studies as well as serve as a volunteer providing assistance to patients and staff in the surgery unit at the University's graduate hospital.  Equipped with these experiences, I am ready to transition to my ultimate goal of a career in medicine. Investment Banker As an investment banker, I provide financial advisory and underwriting services for tax-exempt and taxable debt for municipal and school district issuers and non-profit organizations in healthcare, higher education, and housing.  I am responsible for the analytical structuring of transactions and risk-return valuation of derivative candidates.  I also initiate and manage client relationships as well as prepare and present industry-specific research., First Aid/CPR/AED certification, instructor preparation I completed certification coursework and instructor training in adult and infant CPR, first aid, and the use of an automated external defibrillator through the American Red Cross Preparedness programs.  The role of an instructor is to educate members of the community and businesses on the appropriate response protocols and to increase their familiarity with the practices., Chairperson, Finance and High-Tech Organizations I initiated and organized networking and informational sessions with prominent professionals in both finance and technology fields.  Through these organizations, I also worked to coordinate service projects to provide tutoring services as well as basic needs to underprivileged communities., Student instructor (volunteer) I instructed and supervised pre-kindergarten children in basic learning and safety skills as well as cared for their basic health and wellness., Entomology research project I undertook a research project through the entomology department at Notre Dame to examine the morphology, systematics, and techniques used in the study of insects through specimen collection and preservation of over 100 families of insects.  I presented my physical specimens along with an oral discussion of my findings to senior faculty members at the university., Urban Plunge participant I volunteered to participate in Urban Plunge, an experiential learning course offered by Notre Dame, which engaged me in the work which is done to eradicate poverty in underprivileged areas.  During my semester break, I was immersed for several days and nights working in women's shelters, soup kitchens, and foster homes.  Upon completion of the experience, I composed a research paper detailing my insights and observations., Guest lecturer, Distinguished Speaker Series I was invited to speak, based on my achievements in the fields of venture capital and investment banking, to the graduate MBA students at The Ohio State University about my experiences., Venture Capitalist I was involved in the initial review of business plans in the science and technology industry sectors (medical devices, information technology, manufacturing, and healthcare services) while I worked to develop a strong market expertise in these disciplines.  I performed financial due diligence on potential investments and evaluated the commercial efficacy of deals, assessing the relevant markets and business models.  I developed recommendations in the form of presentations of investment opportunities to the firm's partners and board of directors., Graduate Instructor I was selected by interview and my academic credentials to be an instructor of an undergraduate honors business course at the university.  Under a defined curriculum, I was responsible for instruction, content, method, and grade assignment for over 150 students.  I financed a portion of my graduate education through this teaching position., Clinical laboratory intern I was selected by interview as one of two interns to pioneer this clinical laboratory program at the largest hospital in the city.  I trained and worked as a phlebotamist in inpatient and outpatient clinical settings.  I also was responsible for preparing and analyzing patient specimens in the general clinical laboratory and flow cytology departments., Biological Sciences laboratory research assistant I worked as a research assistant in the ecological genetics laboratory of a senior faculty member at the university.  I investigated the relationship between host specialization and speciation in a particular species of insect., Neuroscience Fair I worked with other neuroscience students to develop a project to present as a learning experience for an outreach program for elementary school students at a collaborative Neuroscience Fair.  Third- and fourth-grade students participating in the Penn Kids Judge! Fair, were the judges of projects developed by Penn undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and graduate science students to explain how the brain and nervous system function.  The exercise was designed to make scientists better communicators and to interest elementary school students in science.  Our project, a relay race demonstrating chemical signaling in the body during times of hunger and food intake, won first place in the fair., Dean's Honor Roll , Hospital volunteer - clinical Volunteer in Endoscopy Department, Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, and Operating Room.  I work in assisting the clinical staff in caring for patients in these departments' various nursing units.  Some of my responsibilities include making rounds on patients, inquiring about their pain status, and other duties as requested by the medical staff.  I interact with the physicians, nurses, hospital administrators, visitors, patients, and families in addition to learning about the important ancillary departmental interactions between nursing units and other departments."

    "text": "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious, the source of all art and science. Albert Einstein  In 2006, I was asked to paint for Our Daily Bread soup kitchen in downtown Cincinnati.  Before starting to paint, I took the opportunity to observe the homeless residents as they conducted their everyday lives, making something out of almost nothing.  The residents at Our Daily Bread each clung to a fragile slice of hope, which they guarded and kept very close.  I could see it in their smiles and kind gestures, as they welcomed me into their company and shared what little they had.    I spoke with Todd, a previously homeless staff member at ODB, who would later be my inspiration for the mural.  He told me homelessness is not a choice, but a consequence.  Homelessness is a symptom of a bigger problem--a disease, addiction, or lifestyle.  Todd recognized his problem and overcame it to reconstruct his life.  After my discussions with Todd, I took a moment to appreciate the personal freedom I enjoy each day in choosing my hopes and dreams, as well as my path in life.  I wanted to express more than Todd's words in the mural; I wanted to express the unspoken words--the power of the hopes and dreams--of the individuals at Our Daily Bread.  I decided to paint both their sadness and joy.   I depicted Todd waiting to open a double door to either the light or the darkness, offering a guest the choices each one of us must make.   I called it Be the change you wish to see in the world, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's dream of freedom for the people of India.  The sense of satisfaction and fulfillment I felt while sharing my thoughts and talents with others at the mural's unveiling ceremony has stuck with me ever since. Such fulfillment continues to strengthen my desire and commitment to becoming a physician.  My experience with the homeless helped me explore and observe the underlying message for the mural.  Similarly, in order to identify and solve a medical problem, a physician must actively listen to the details of what her patient is saying, as well as what her patient is not saying.  Understanding the untold story can be as important, and possibly even more important, than understanding the story explicitly presented.  In designing the mural, I translated the impressions and hopes of individuals into the details, which in turn, contributed to a result that is very real and tangible: the mural.  I want to enter medical school to develop this talent more.  In the future, I want to actively listen to a patient, and hear the unspoken details--the mannerism, facial expressions, and symptoms--to solve the problem.  I see myself as a person who can successfully mix the creativity involved in both the arts and the sciences.  One of the primary reasons I pursued Biomedical Engineering, with the ultimate goal of becoming a physician, was because I view an engineer as practicing the science of the art, while I see a physician as practicing the art of the science.  Through Biomedical Engineering, I wanted to be the artist and the engineer to design surgical devices and prosthetic instruments.    An engineer must be aware that the concepts used to solve one engineering problem will differ from those used to solve the next.  Hence, an engineer quickly learns how to utilize creativity, resourcefulness, and intuition to solve complex problems. I have learned engineering principles and their applications to healthcare.  I have also learned to balance the simple solution with the desire to meet the needs of the user or patient.  As a physician, I want to be able to identify and analyze a problem--the disease, disorder, or syndrome--from all angles.  I hope to approach it by using my collective scientific knowledge, passion for the arts, as well as my intuition.   I like to sketch and paint just about any object put in front of me.  I do simply because I can and must.   I want to see the subtle details and accurately express the complexity of the object.  I must see that there are quite a few colors to work with and quite a few angles to choose from. With enough diligence, thought, and creativity, I can blend together the details into a piece that is both beautiful and real--a work of art. Just as the mural began as a blank canvas and became a work of art, so too does a physician begin with a patient and unknown problem. By collecting physiological data, a physician can discover the solution and has the skills necessary to implement the treatment. I want to enter medical school to learn and experience this talent.    Being a physician is more than an occupation; it is a way of life.  I do not expect to significantly change the life of every patient I encounter, although the positive impact a physician can have on the lives of so many draws me toward this path.  In the future, I want to use my sensitivity and creativity expressed through artistry, my academic skills as a Biomedical Engineer, as well as my strong sense of self and responsibility, to collect and process physiological data on many levels.   Next year, I hope to enter medical school and continue to use these skills to imagine and create medical solutions. Dean's List Distinction At the University of Cincinnati, all undergraduate students with at least 12 credit hours are placed on the Dean's List if their quarterly grade point average is at least a 3.400. I met this requirement after my first academic quarter at UC in the fall of 2007, and I have continued to earn the Dean's List distinction for all of my academic quarters at the university., CEAS Ambassadors: Treasurer/Secretary/Vice-Pesident CEAS Ambassadors is a service organization that is involved with various events and activities hosted by the College of Engineering and Applied Science, such as Open House and high school recruiting events. We work to strengthen the relationship between current students, future students, alumni, faculty, and staff of the college. We primarily fulfill our role of ambassadors by serving as tour guides to prospective students every Friday. As student representatives to our college, we promote CEAS by giving prospective students the opportunity to learn about our college in a casual (and less intimidating) atmosphere during the Friday tours. I have been a member since the spring of my freshman year at the University of Cincinnati. I have held the position of Secretary and Treasurer, and just this past spring, I was elected as Vice-president for the 2010/2011 academic year. With the help of the President and executive board, I hope to increase the service aspect of our organization. I want to seek more opportunities to serve the college, outside of Open House and college tours, as well as plan a community service event for each quarter. For example, in the past we visited the Ronald McDonald house near the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine to play board games and bake with the resident children.,  Co-operative Education Student/ Research Assistant,  Co-operative Eduction Student/ Research Assistant, SURF-N Poster Presentation During the last few weeks of my internship with the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Neuroscience, I designed and created a poster summing up the projects I worked on and the knowledge I had gained. The primary focus of the poster was the cloning project I was assigned and its application to multiple sclerosis research.   My mentor, Dr. Aaron Johnson, helped me organize the poster, so it would flow nicely for presentation. It was my responsibility to design the figures and write the abstract, methods, and conclusions. The poster title was: Cell Specific Disruption of H-2K^b and H-2D^b Genes Employing Splicing by Overlap Extension PCR. I presented the poster at the Undergraduate Research Symposium in August. Since one of the primary benefactors of Dr. Johnson's research is the coach of the Bengal's football team, Marvin Lewis, a copy of the poster hangs at the Paul Brown Stadium in downtown Cincinnati., College of Engineering and Applied Science EWeek Chair EWeek is a nationally recognized week dedicated to the positive contribution of engineers globally. EWeek is a purely student-run event at UC. The EWeek committee organizes the events throughout the week, in which student teams engage with each other and engineering professors. As the chair of the EWeek committee for 2 years, it was my duty to oversee the planning, funding, and organization of each of the activities for EWeek 2009 and 2010. Some of the activities include team events, the Engineering Blood Drive, a date auction benefiting the American Cancer Society's Relay For Life, a canned food drive, and finally, the Engineering Banquet and Awards Ceremony.   I had the opportunity to collaborate with corporate sponsors, college faculty (including the dean), and the engineering student body. In 2009, our biggest accomplishment was the student date auction, in which we raised over $1600 for Relay For Life in less than 3 hours. Each year, EWeek ends with the Engineering Banquet, a highly regarded event attended by students, faculty, and corporate sponsors, at Paul Brown Stadium in downtown Cincinnati. I had the opportunity to co-host both the 2009 and 2010 banquets. Throughout EWeek 2010, I trained multiple engineering students and shared a few pointers on how to carry on the EWeek tradition., University of Cincinnati Homecoming Court For the 2009 Homecoming at the University of Cincinnati, a total of 35 female students were nominated by campus student organizations as Homecoming candidates. I was nominated by the Engineering Tribunal. The top 10 candidates were chosen by votes from the UC student body.  The top 5 candidates--the Homecoming Court-- were selected after an interview by a panel of faculty, staff, students, and alumni.  The top 5 candidates were scored on academics, school spirit, involvement, and leadership. As a member of the Homecoming Court, I was invited to be in the Homecoming Day parade, in which the UC community and surrounding community celebrated the UC Big East Football Championship Team. The Homecoming Queen was announced at the sold-out football game. Homecoming Day was an exciting event for the University of Cincinnati and the surrounding community, and though I did not win as Homecoming Queen, I was honored to represent UC as a member of the Court., Department of Cancer and Cell Biology Co-op Quarter II & III I completed another two cooperative education (co-op) quarters by working full-time in the Waltz laboratory. I was assigned to work for a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Aaron Marshall, who also served as my mentor throughout the two quarters. During this experience, I was exposed to the professional environment and given the opportunity to research the human protein, Ron receptor tyrosine kinase, in more detail. I was given a list of tasks each day, and it was primarily up to myself as to how to complete these tasks. If a particular experiment failed, my mentor and I would sit down and discuss how to approach the process differently.  My accomplishments for this co-op include: I acquired a broad understanding of the human protein, Ron receptor tyrosine kinase, and its participation in cell signaling and tumor growth; I learned technical skills in a research laboratory by completing a variety of bench work and experiments; and most importantly, I have a better understanding of the process of research, so I may serve as liaison between the research and clinical environment in the future. Lastly, I will design a research poster for the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine undergraduate research symposium in August 2010, summarizing my cumulative research over the past three co-op quarters., Department of Cancer and Cell Biology Co-op Quarter I I completed my first cooperative education (co-op) quarter by working full-time in the Waltz laboratory at UC. I was assigned to work for a postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Nikolaos Nikolaidis.  My goals for this term included: acquire a broad understanding of the human protein, Ron receptor tyrosine kinase, examine its participation in the inflammatory response, and aid in the Waltz lab research by carrying out various experiments to shed light on the role of Ron in cell signaling. My main project, a cloning project involving the insertion of the full Ron gene into a pCDNA plasmid, is a process I merely read about in my genetics class. Through this experience, I was able to directly apply classroom knowledge to lab work.  I also created new relationships with established researchers of cancer. I formed a better understanding of the correct methods of processing and examining scientific data, and I learned the importance of consistency and detail in the process of research. I kept my own lab notebook throughout the quarter to document my progress--failures and successes. The techniques I learned in my first co-op quarter carried over to my next co-op terms the following year., Church Lector I first became a lector for Sunday mass at my home church, St. Ignatius. Lectoring has been one avenue for me to stay involved with the mass and get to know other parishioners. I continued to lector in college at St. Monica/St. George Parish. The parish is located very close to UC's main campus, and is heavily involved with UC students and campus life. St. Monica/St. George encourages students to give back to the Cincinnati community.  In becoming a lector, I could stay involved with the parish's liturgical ministry., Our Daily Bread Soup Kitchen Mural Project In 2006, my art teacher at Mercy high school asked me to paint a mural for Our Daily Bread soup kitchen in downtown Cincinnati.  I had the opportunity to observe the homeless residents while they made something out of almost nothing.  The ODB residents welcomed me into their company. I spoke with Todd, a previously homeless staff member, who would be my inspiration for the mural.  He told me homelessness is not a choice, but a consequence.  Homelessness is a symptom of a bigger problem-- a disease, addiction, or lifestyle.  Todd recognized his problem and overcame it to redevelop his life. I painted both the sadness and joy of the ODB residents. I decided to paint Todd, waiting to open a double door to the light or the darkness, offering a guest the choices each one of must make. With the guidance and inspiration of the ODB residents, the mural was completed in about three months. I called it: Be the change you wish to see in the world, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and his dream of peace for the people of India. The unveiling ceremony was an extremely rewarding event; I was able to share my thoughts and talents with the residents of ODB and the community. The mural still hangs outside the entrance to Our Daily Bread today., Milestones Inc. Volunteer Milestones is a therapeutic horseback riding center for children with disabilities. Therapeutic horseback riding provides a unique (and fun) type of therapy for children that can improve a child's muscle control and strength, while allowing for the development of independence and confidence.  I volunteered at Milestones every other weekend with a group of UC students. As a volunteer, I helped teach the children the basics of horse care and riding, assist them while riding, encourage independent behavior, and promote their communication skills.  Most importantly, I would uphold the love and enthusiasm the creators of Milestones started for both the children and horses, throughout the training sessions. The most rewarding aspect of Milestones was being able to observe the growing bond between a child and a horse from week to week. I will never forget the glowing face of a child riding a horse all on his own for the first time and the parents watching with smiles., Relay for Life Captain/Participant Relay For Life, in support of the American Cancer Society, is the largest student-organized community service event at the University of Cincinnati. Spring quarter means Relay For Life at UC. The month leading up to Relay is an eventful time, full of fund-raising activities coordinated by student teams. On the night of Relay, my team and I celebrated those whose lives have been hurt by cancer for 18 hours. My freshman year, 2008, I served as a team captain, in which my team earned over $1100 for the American Cancer Society. During the weeks leading up to the main event, our team went around the halls of freshman dorms asking for spare change; we also held a bake sale. I have been a participant each year at UC, devoting my time to Relay during the couple of weeks leading up to the big event., Sigma Phi Women's Honorary Member & Alumni Relations Chair Sigma Phi is a honorary for women at the University of Cincinnati. It exists to bring together individuals who have contributed significantly to the University of Cincinnati through academics, campus life and activities, and community service. I was tapped into the Sigma Phi Class of 2010. As a member, I attend weekly meetings in which we gather on a basis of understanding, mutual interest in promoting our university, and the desire to help each other in each of our endeavors. Sigma Phi plans and hosts Pamper Yourself, an evening of relaxation and inspiration that brings together the female leaders of UC's student organizations. As the sister organization to Sigma Sigma, the members of Sigma Phi co-host the annual Sigma Sigma Carnival at the University of Cincinnati. The Sigma Sigma Carnival is a tradition that began in 1940, in which all UC student organizations are invited to host a booth and help raise money to support a gift to give back to the university. I helped with food and beverages at this year's carnival, and in the past, I have designed and hosted a booth for the College of Engineering and Applied Science Tribunal., Omicron Delta Kappa Member The primary purpose of ODK is to honor those who have attained a high standard of efficiency in collegiate activities. ODK also recognizes achievement in scholarship, athletics, campus/community services, mass media, and creative arts.  As a member of ODK, I attend hourly meetings each week, in which representatives of all phases of campus life and in all sorts of student organizations gather to strengthen the relationships between each other. We also collaborate with UC's Student Activities and Leadership Development division to help plan Camp Bearcat, a first year student leadership institute developed by students for students. Camp Bearcat is a weekend retreat in October that offers incoming freshman the opportunity to network with upperclassmen, enrich leadership, listen to inspirational speakers, and most importantly, connect with their fellow peers. As UC's leadership honorary, the members of ODK help plan and host this event. We are also responsible for building up the hype and energy throughout the event and inspire school spirit and leadership from the students., Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Neuroscience The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at the University of Cincinnati is designed to give hands-on research experience to undergraduate students pursuing a career in medicine. Through this program, I was assigned to work in a laboratory dedicated to the research of multiple sclerosis (MS) for 10 weeks. The primary goal of the laboratory was to study MS in animal models through magnetic resonance imaging.  During my internship, I designed, engineered, and synthesized a gene of the immune system for MS research in mouse models. I was also assigned another project, in which a team and I examined MS progression in mice with MRI, while also monitoring their loss of motor function. At the end of the program, I designed a poster summarizing my research for the University of Cincinnati undergraduate research symposium in August 2008. What I will always remember about this experience was the importance of team work between the scientist and the clinician. The scientists set up the experiments and animal models, while the clinician examined the brain MRI images and data. It was after this program that I understood the importance of translational research and the power it has to advance medicine and improve human health."

    "text": "Since childhood, I have always been drawn to challenges.  I feel the strongest sense of accomplishment from being pushed beyond my experience.  Likewise, I have always strived to help others and I find deep fulfillment from doing so.  I have chosen to pursue a medical career because it provides challenge, excitement, and the opportunity to serve others.  Having a passion for medicine since I was very young, I have had many unique opportunities to explore its practice.  Starting in high school, I have shadowed doctors in a variety of fields, both in surgery and in clinical practice.  These fields include: family practice, emergency medicine, orthopedics, general surgery, ENT/neurotology, and transplants. I also have had hands-on experience in cadaver and research labs.  These experiences have set the foundation for a career as an innovating surgeon, one that not only practices, but also leads research and interfaces with industry.    Over the past four years I have studied Biomedical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati.   During my junior year, I was invited to participate with a group of doctors and professional engineers to review a biomedical engineering textbook.  During a discussion within the group, I realized that through innovation, a surgeon could treat thousands of patients all over the world while healing the individual patient locally.  I chose a background in engineering to help fulfill my personal goal of leading medical innovation. The prospect of healing patients not only within my community, but also internationally, motivates me to continue towards my goal to become an innovating surgeon -- fully aware of the commitments that are required to do so.  My personal experiences have helped me understand the sacrifices a physician must make for an education and a career.  It is this commitment I am and will be excited to make.  A mentor of mine once told me that a surgeon reaches his greatest potential toward the end of his career when he has the greatest amount of experience.  To me, this sentiment highlights the commitment physicians must have to continuous learning and training in a constantly evolving field.  My time as an undergraduate at UC has helped me to appreciate the value of knowledge and the excitement that comes from learning.  However clich the phrase may be, knowledge is power. That is precisely what makes learning exciting for me; it empowers me to solve problems.  Before solving an engineering problem, I know from my training within the classroom and in industry that it is equally important to fully define the problem as it is to know what solutions already exist.  The latter of these principles is an unending pursuit and is realized by the training, research, and study a doctor must perform throughout his career.  I enjoy studying and accumulating knowledge. Hence, I know I will thrive in the academic challenges of a medical career.    In addition to pursuing medical innovation, other significant goals of mine are to heal, to serve and to be among others.  I am the founder of the Annual Robbie Slack Memorial Tennis Tournament, and have been directing it since my junior year of high school.  The tournament benefits the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Greater Cincinnati with an annual donation of all event proceeds.  At the conclusion of the first few tournament events, I delivered a check to the Ronald McDonald House at a small ceremony. I felt a great sense of accomplishment as House volunteers, employees, and directors shook my hand.  While I enjoyed the attention, it was after the celebration was over that I felt the strongest sense of accomplishment and a deep fulfillment.  My greatest reward was looking back on the work that I had done, on the challenges that I had overcome and on the patients who benefited from my work. Eventually, the ceremonies at the Ronald McDonald House turned into a brief tour and a few handshakes.  Even without the ceremonies, I still get a great sense of pride and satisfaction after the tournament is over.  My fulfillment comes from working hard for something that benefits others more than myself.  I imagine that the satisfaction a doctor feels after a day's work is similar to my feeling and it is one I would like to perpetuate with a medical career of my own.    From talking with medical students and doctors, I expect that in medical school, I will work harder than I ever have before. I understand that during my education, my desired field of practice may change.  But it is from these same talks that I am confident a medical career is right for me.  They have assured me that I have the motivation to succeed in medicine, and that my goals - while large - are possible with hard work and commitment.  I believe my experiences in the biomedical industry, volunteer research, academia, and professional shadowing have given me the foundation to thrive in both medical school and a medical career. Cincinnati Police Department-Computer Programmer Analyst As a Computer Programmer Analyst for the Cincinnati Police, I assisted in beta testing and deployment of a new accident reporting system. My role can be broken down into two phases.  In the first phase, my duties included mastering the use of the system and testing it for flaws. I then reported any findings to my supervising officer.  In the second phase, I assisted in classroom sessions where groups of officers were instructed on how to use the new reporting system. Later, I was stationed at four district headquarters where I provided technical support to officers in the field.  My work required me to interact with the public and teach officers in a controlled environment and on the scene., Summer CoOp at the Enviornmental Protection Agency As a Laboratory Support and Accountability Staff Intern at the EPA, I reported to the accountability manager at the National Risk Management Research Lab.  My main function was to identify and update the status of annual performance measures within Excel spreadsheets. However, by completing my assignments quickly, I was able to conduct bench research that re-established an investigation into hydrophobicity of pathogens in drinking water.  In this position, I organized the labs previous findings, determined a protocol from previous testing, acquainted myself with the lab procedures, and began testing the efficacy of the old protocol., CoOp at Integra LifeSciences As a Product Development CoOp, I spent a year completing the duties of a full-time Design Engineer in the Biomedical Industry. During this time, I worked alongside other CoOps and rose to a leading role in a Total Wrist Arthroplasty (TWA) Development project.  My duties included implant/instrumentation design; writing and performing engineering test protocols; contributing in design cadaver labs and assisting in teaching labs; ordering prototypes and managing suppliers; design analysis of prototypes, implants and instruments; managing and tracking the development of the system; as well as performing literature reviews and benchmarking marketed products., Research Assistant- Temporal Bone VR Simulation Study As a volunteer research assistant for Dr Samy, I initiated and managed a study investigating the utility of a virtual reality surgical simulator on temporal bone drilling skill.  For this position I have performed background research where I compiled data on objective grading of surgical skill and surgical task-based assessments.  I constructed a protocol for the study, created and statistically validated a grading scale based on published studies, and completed a successful IRB application with Dr Samy's staff. I have also been in charge of preparing temporal bone specimens and recruiting surgically naive subjects for the study., File Clerk/Office Aid at Ohio Valley Ortheopedics During my 2008 winter break from college, I worked as a file clerk and office aid for a private orthopedic practice in Cincinnati, Ohio. I accepted the position not only as a way to generate income, but also as a means to explore the inner workings of a private medical practice., Mercy Healthplex Tennis Instructor I instructed private and group tennis lessons for the Mercy Healthplex between my junior years of high school to my junior year of college. Throughout that time, I coached both children and adults of various skill levels., Cincinnatus Scholarship/ Academic Acknowledgements I received the University of Cincinnati Cincinnatus Scholarship for the past four years of undergrad and have been listed on the Dean's list every quarter of my undergraduate career.  For the Cincinnatus scholarship, I have maintained academic excellence while completing community service.  I have participated in events such as: Fuller Center Alternative Spring Break to Shreveport, LA to rebuild a home, helping to run and manage Cincinnati Community Outreach as an Executive Officer, working with Boy Scouts of America Mulch Move, and tutoring a freshman learning community in chemistry., Sigma Phi Epsilon I was recruited to Sigma Phi Epsilon and awarded the Balanced Man Scholarship based on my high school academic achievements and community involvement. I quickly became involved with the inner workings of the chapter, participating in chapter meetings and holding positions such as Social Chair('07-'08), Philanthropy Chair(07-'09), Phi Development Coordinator('09-'10), Junior Guard('09-'10), and one of eight Standards Board Officials('07-'10).  As a senior member, I worked with events and philanthropy councils as an advisor to the younger members. My experience in the chapter's mentor program has helped develop my leadership skills., Biomedical Extracucciculars In my later years of undergrad, I have had several unique biomedical experiences. One experience involved a Design Charette for a local teen who sustained neurological damage from a falling tree limb.  In a blitz style design effort, our task was to construct a device that would assist him in extending his hand and fingers, a task he was no longer able to do on his own.  I also participated in a Biomedical Engineering textbook review with a group of surgical residents and industry professionals.  The purpose of the group was to learn the innovative design process from the textbook for use in future potential design efforts., Intramural Sports and Personal Fitness Physical fitness has been a priority for me throughout my life.  I played on intramural soccer and flag football teams, practiced with the tennis club, took Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes, and enjoyed a consistent personal fitness schedule that included powerlifting. Throughout my undergraduate career, I have been able to set aside time for my athletic hobbies and have maintained a healthy balance between work and play.,  Product Development CoOp, Professional Shadowing -Shadowed Dr Ravi Samy & Dr Nael Shoman, ENT/Nuerotology, +30 hours in OR and clinic -Shadowed Dr Colin Martin, UC, Emergency Surgery, 12 hour shift -Shadowed Dr Amit Tevar, UC, Kidney transplant -Shadowed Dr Brad Warner, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, General Surgery, 6+ Hours in OR -Shadowed Dr David Taylor, Ohio Valley Orthopedics, 4+ hours OR & 4+ hours clinic  -Shadowed Dr Joseph Thomas, Ohio Valley Orthopedics, 4+ hours OR - Shadowed Dr Steven Rudich, UC, Exploratory Laparoscopy w/ Ultra Sound and Liver Biopsy - With Dr Jon Thompson, UC, I shadowed and eventually took part in interviewing  ER Surgeons and Physicians for areas of innovation in the acute resuscitation process, Robbie Slack Memorial Tennis Touunament- Director Since 2006, I have directed the annual Robbie Slack Memorial Tennis Tournament.  I am the founder and six-time director of this charity event that has donated over $38,000 to the Ronald McDonald House of Greater Cincinnati. For the event to be a success, I had to organize logistics for the tournament; sanction the tournament with the USTA; recruit players; solicit sponsors and donations; recruit and manage service volunteers; generate and direct the match schedules between multiple sites; and moderate player and parent disputes.,  Supplementary Instruction Leader, Reserach Assistant- LapMentor II Study The work I did with Dr Thompson and the LapMentor Research team resulted in the following publications:  I was acknowledged in:     Thompson JR, Doarn CR, Roesch MJ, Henry BD, Broderick TJ.  Limited Value of Haptics in Virtual Reality Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Training.

    "text": "Everyone has a story. Our past influences the way that we interact with the world, and with each other. This isn't immediately apparent at Miami University, where many of the students seem roughly the same: white, upper-middle class, apathetically conservative, Christian. However, while leading sessions of intergroup dialogue through the Diversity Affairs Council, their stories emerged. For instance, one girl who, at first glance, would did not seem too different from the Miami stereotype, talked about growing up in Bosnia and how she hates being seen as a fragile war victim. In listening to the participants tell tales of their past and of their hopes and dreams, I became aware of my ability to make strangers feel comfortable sharing their lives.  When I walk into a room with a patient, I will always remember not to assume I know all about him or her from first impressions; there will always be more relevant information just below the surface.  I must always listen first and act second.  Some patients withhold medically relevant information because they fear criticism or worry that the doctor's disapproval will affect the quality of care they receive. For example, members of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (GLBTQ) community often fear disclosing their sexual orientation to their doctors or are even reluctant to seek medical care. In my Women's Studies class that focused on GLBTQ issues, we studied the way in which medical practitioners have disadvantaged the GLBTQ community throughout history. Because of religious or moral values, or just because of ignorance, doctors have historically provided inadequate care to this group. Discrimination delayed the search for the causes of AIDS and social stigmas negatively affected the treatment of patients with the disease. After facilitating dialogues and taking my Women's Studies class, I not only know how to create an open and safe space, but I also know the importance of the safe space for the health and well-being of patients.  Getting to know the patient on a personal level enhances the doctor/patient relationship and fosters a sense of intimacy and trust. When I shadowed Dr. Reigle I noticed that her patients felt very comfortable and would often tell her stories that seemed unrelated to their current health concerns. I enjoyed hearing about their children or grandchildren, or about a recent trip. Dr. Riegle later included their stories in the notes that she dictated, because she realized that factors such as the patient's level of stress can affect their ability to emotionally and physically tolerate a treatment or recover from surgery. She helped me see how much my affinity for stories would help me as a physician.  This connection is pivotal in order to truly help patients and get on a deeper level during the time I will be able to interact with them in the office. As a urologist, Dr. Reigle is able to see many patients regularly in office visits and also gets to perform surgeries. I would enjoy the precision work of surgery, but it is more important to me to know the person under the surgical gown and their stories.  My understanding of the social context of medicine, paired with my aptitude for science, will allow me to excel in patient care. One of the most emotional stories I heard during a session of intergroup dialogue was about a participant's family learning to adapt to life after her mother died of breast cancer. In this case, a devastating disease changed this student's life forever. For another student with an eating disorder, daily struggles and the pursuit of perfection turned into life-threatening health problems.  I will be able to give my patients confidence and take away the fear that comes from a lack of knowledge. I will also help my patients by strongly promoting preventative medicine and by compassionately offering solutions and treatments without judgment.  I intend to become a primary care physician, because of my interest in following my patients' stories over time and in improving the quality of medicine delivered to underserved communities.  As a physician, I will be working in a healthcare system wrought with disparities, facing the challenges of trying to care for the millions who are underinsured and overlooked. My experiences at Miami have given me the skills that I will need to solve both big and small problems with the way healthcare is delivered. I now have the strength to constantly advocate for my patients, no matter their backgrounds, in order to effect change in the health of communities and--more  importantly--in people's lives.  At Miami, I learned to appreciate the richness of every person's story. I believe that listening attentively and treating all patients with respect, as well as making primary healthcare more readily available, can ameliorate many healthcare challenges. Although the word patient typically describes a person who sits and waits, I will empower those I treat to take control of their care, ask questions, and make healthy choices. University Summer Scholars After just one year in the lab, I so impressed Dr. Lorigan that I was allowed the responsibility to undertake an independent project in the lab. I wanted to develop a better method for studying membrane protein structure using EPR Spectroscopy. The current method involves inserting peptides into bicelles(disc-shaped phospholipid bilayers used in place of natural membranes). The challenge is that to obtain the most structural information from an EPR study bicelles need to be aligned with the magnetic field. Bicelles can be doped with Lanthanide ions for alignment, but this causes a broadening of spectral lines. For my project, I am using a special lipid that has a magnetic moment to align the bicelles instead of the Lanthanide ions. During the spring of 2010, I used my preliminary data to apply for a University Summer Scholars position to work on this project for 10 weeks during the Summer.  Because my project was accepted, I am receiving a stipend and faculty mentoring that will allow me to complete my work and get my results published in the coming year., Recording Director of the Executive Board of DAC Diversity Affairs Council (DAC) is a branch of Associated Student Government that exists to strengthen and promote the diverse communities of Miami, and to improve cultural competency on campus. DAC is made up of 2 repreresentatives from each of the 98 organizations that include some aspect of diversity in their mission statement. When I joined the board of the Association of Jewish Students, I volunteered to represent AJS on the Diversity Affairs Council. One year later, I was nominated by a fellow DAC member and selected by the Director of Diverse Student Development for the Executive Board of DAC. As the recording director, I have had the opportunity to act as the liaison between many groups on the council. Diverse student groups are strengthened when they work together because cooperative programs are more enriching and better attended. I have also created a weekly e-newsletter called DAC Monday Memos that announces events from the groups on the Council. This publication is sent out to about 1,400 students and 200 faculty and staff every Monday. I have gained computer skills from managing DAC's listserves, but the best part is that now that I know about less advertised events, I have had the opportunity to attend events such as a Nepali New Year Celebration and a Women's Symposium poetry reading., Community Service Construction Projects During fall break of my first year at Miami, I traveled to New Orleans to aid in the reconstruction efforts that were still going on after Hurricane Katrina. I installed siding and roofing on a Habitat House for a family that had been living in a trailer since the storm flattened their previous home in August 2005. I continued to volunteer with Habitat for Humanity in Oxford, Ohio  after returning home. The house that I helped build aided a family who needed help because their medical bills became too much after one parent lost his job. After talking to the family, I realized that my presence and words of encouragment were just as valuable as each shingle I carefully nailed in place. I returned to New Orleans for an Alternative Spring Break trip in 2009 and was amazed at the destruction that still existed almost four years after Hurricane Katrina. My group rebuilt a fence that had mostly dissappeared in the storm for a family that lived in the Lower Ninth Ward. The owner of the house had made many repairs to the house by himself, but had recently broken his back at his construction job. He was very thankful but nothing compared to the smiles on the faces of his small children.  High crime rates had made it too dangerous for them to play outside, but that simple fence helped  their lives return to normal., Shadowing of Urologist, Dr. Melissa D. Reigle I asked Dr. Riegle, a urologist, if I could shadow her because a few of my family members, who are normally anxious about doctor visits, told me about how comfortable she made them feel. While I was interested in urology so I could observe both surgeries and patient care, I was initially concerned that I might feel uncomfortable; but shadowing Dr. Riegle turned out to be an amazing experience. After the first patient, my concerns faded and I was able to learn so much about what it is like to be a physician. During my week with Dr. Riegle, I observed 5 surgeries and about 100 office visits.. Dr. Reigle always took the time to tell me about the patients before we entered the rooms so that I could understand their histories. She made sure that my questions were always answered and let me look into the microscope to see all of the urine and semen samples. After I learned about what to look for, she asked me about what cell types were in the samples, rather than just telling me. I learned that a doctor must carefully  listen to  the patient because even seemingly unrelated issues can affect a patient's urological health. Because I am interested in becoming a primary care doctor, I will shadow Dr. Richard Kratche, a family physician, this summer., Harrison Scholarship I feel very honored to have been selected as a recipient of the Harrison Scholarship, a full ride scholarship, based on my exceptional academics and extracurricular involvement during high school. To qualify for this extremely competitive award (only awarded to 21 students in a class of more than 3,600 students), I had to not only demonstrate my hard work and high school achievements, but also to maintain excellent grades while at Miami., Membrane Protein Research in Dr. Gary A. Lorigan's lab. I joined Dr. Lorigan's lab to study the structural topology and dynamics of membrane-bound peptides because membrane proteins are key components of transporters and receptors, and small mutations in them often lead to disease. When I joined the lab group, I began to synthesize peptides with at least one nitroxide spin label and to purify them using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Then I added the peptides to lipids, which self-aggregate into structures such as micelles or vescicles around the peptides. We study the peptides in a lipid environment that is similar to natural membranes, so that our structural and dynamic measurements reflect physiological conditions. We use either Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) or Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (EPR) to determine structural and dynamic properties. During my first year in the lab, I co-authored a paper entitled Molecular-Scale Force Measurement in a Coiled-Coil Peptide Dimer by Electron Spin Resonance, which was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on March 30, 2009.  I am excited that our research in characterizing membrane proteins helps to better understand disease mechanisms, because it makes it possible that we might one day have more cures., Organic Chemistry Tutor I mentor a group of 12 students who are underrepresented in science in organic chemistry. The group meets twice a week and I review the current lecture material, help students who have fallen behind and assign practice problems for our sessions. I seek to empower students to take responsibility for their own learning.  Rather than waiting for knowledge to be handed down to them, as they do in lecture, my students must work together to reach new understandings. By answering each other's questions, the students gain confidence and remember concepts more easily. My goal is that my students learn more chemistry from working through problems together than they do from me teaching. Leading the group has been equally beneficial for me. Besides solidifying my own knowledge of organic chemistry, I have learned a lot about teaching and about group dynamics. Now I am more able to explain difficult concepts in a less esoteric manner. I know how to keep a group focused and motivated, even when the members would rather give up. Sometimes the students get overwhelmed by all that they need to know, but usually all the students need is a little encouragement from someone who has been in their position., Joseph A. Culler Prize in Physics I received the Joseph A. Culler Prize in Physics in recognition of outstanding work in Miami's freshman/sophomore level physics course. My Professor, Dr. Stephen G. Alexander, selected just a few students for this award, based on their hard work and excellent academic achievement in his course., Quilter/Quilting Instructor In this club, we sew quilts and give them to children staying at a Ronald McDonald House while receiving medical treatment. Many of them are far from home and are not feeling well from various health conditions. Some of the children have difficulty connecting to others because they do not speak english. The quilts provide them with comfort, strength, and the warmth of a caring community. Whether the kids are shy or outgoing, they happily bundle up in the colorful creations. Their parents also truly appreciate the gesture. I have also spent a lot of time fundraising and seeking donations of fabric and supplies, but it is all worth it when I see the comfort that our quilts can provide to both the children and their parents.,  Resident Assistant, Leadership of the Association of Jewish Students The Association of Jewish Students (AJS) is an organization devoted to developing the vibrant community of students that are either Jewish or interested in Judaism. Each member of the executive board is responsible for planning, promoting, and helping to carry out educational, religious, social, cultural, and community service programs.  After my first semester at Miami, I was elected to position of Culture and Education Coordinator. In that capacity, I created programs to help Miami students learn about the diversity within Jewish populations around the world. During one program I planned, we celebrated the Sabbath with Ethiopian food and learned from an Ethiopian Jew, who described his experience of immigrating to Israel via Operation Solomon . After my term ended, I became the Secretary of AJS for the next two years. As secretary, I have continued to create well-attended and educational programs, while aiding in the group's communication by taking minutes. This April, I was voted into the position of president. I am excited to bring together a group of students that can learn from each other and work together to  promote Jewish ideals, such as social justice.  I will use the community building skills that I have gained from AJS as a Resident Assistant in a first-year residence hall in the coming year."

    "text": "Some people seem to be born into a particular profession.  Over the course of my educational career, I have known many people who seemed to have figured out very early in life what profession they wanted to pursue.  I, however, was not one of these people.  For me, college was a process whereby I discovered that healthcare offers the opportunity to help people in a way that, in my opinion, is unique to any profession. \tWhen I entered college, I was a typical 18 year-old kid that wanted to rebel against my family history and leave my home state of Ohio behind.  I enrolled in Colby College in Waterville, Maine (1000 miles away from Dayton; my home city) and pursued a liberal array of disciplines including philosophy, chemistry, and art.  Despite the fact that both my father and grandfather were physicians, I had not seriously considered medicine as a future profession as I had a strong desire to forge my own path in life.   \tAs my freshman year progressed, I began to take particular interest in my science classes.  In addition, I began to think about what exactly I wanted to do after college.  I thought maybe journalism would be something that would spark my interest.  Over Christmas break of my freshman year I shadowed an editor for the Dayton Daily News.  Although it was an enjoyable experience, I didn't get that feeling I was searching for; the feeling of profound meaning and satisfaction that I wanted from a profession.   \tBy sophomore year, I had gotten very interested in my life science courses and had picked Biology as my major.  I also began talking with my father about what exactly being a physician is like, and I decided that I would like to shadow some different physicians.  Over the course of the year I spent time with my father as well as Dr. Robert Bulow, a cardiologist, and Dr. Marcos Amongero, an orthopedic surgeon.  In addition, I spent a month volunteering at Inland Hospital in Waterville, Maine. \tIt was during these shadowing and volunteering sessions that I solidified my desire to pursue medical school.  When I observed the interaction between the physician and patient, I realized that there was something profound in the relationship that was cultivated between these individuals.  I became fascinated with the way in which the physician cared for the patient, and also how the patient responded.  Never before had I witnessed this kind of connection.  I found it very unique and interesting how the physician transcended generational and demographical gaps and improved the quality of life for other people. \tIn addition, there are other characteristics about the physician lifestyle that appeal to me.  For example, healthcare offers a dynamic, constantly involving working environment where one is able to continue one's education into later life.  It also offers the ability to practice in many different areas of the country, and the flexibility to raise a family.  Although these are definite perks that should be considered when pursuing a profession, they are not the central motivating factor for me.  Rather it is my desire to be a part of the unique physician-patient relationship that has inspired me to endure the premed path through college. Mission Trip to Eastern Ohio For 3 days in June (of 2003, 2005, and 2006) I aided Rural Appalachian Housing Development in association with St. Paul's Episcopal Church (my local Church). I helped rebuild homes (in particular I did shingling and window repair) for the disadvantaged in the area surrounding Athens, Ohio., Dean's List Given for maintaining a grade point average in excess of a 3.5 in a particular semester.  I was given this award 5 times., Joseph A. Culler Prize Given for outstanding work in the freshman/sophomore level Physics course at Miami University., Summer Employee I assisted full time employees with street/waterline maintenance for three summers.  I also cut grass, trimmed trees, and performed various other tasks required by the City of Oakwood., Day Surgery / Emergency Room Volunteer I assisted patients into and out of the hospital after minor procedures, changed linens and cleaned the recovery rooms, ran errands for nurses, and made coffee and toast for recovering patients in day surgery., Premedical Organization (Fraternity) I attended the weekly meetings which included speakers (such as the President of Miami, various doctors, malpractice lawyers, etc.).  I was a member of the business committee which was responsible for asking local businesses to sponsor our large yearly event: a dinner banquet for Children's Miracle Network.  I also volunteered in Phi Delta Epsilon's name at the Kid's Fair held at Miami University, and aided in various brotherhood events throughout my junior year at Miami University., Teaching Assistant for Chemistry 142 Lab I led the second semester inorganic chemistry lab in coordination with Dr. Rebecca Rowe.  I answered questions during lab and provided input on lab techniques for students., Physician Shadowing I spent 10 hours with Dr. Bulow, a cardiologist in Dayton, Ohio.  I attended rounds at Kettering Hospital and observed him treating patients at his practice in Dayton., Physician Shadowing I spent 20 hours with Dr. Amongero, an orthopedic surgeon, as he examined patients at his practice in Dayton, Ohio.  In addition, I observed 3 spinal surgeries that he performed at Miami Valley Hospital., Volunteer at Men's Health Fair I spent 5 hours setting up and greeting visitors to the Men's Health Fair in Waterville, Maine., Physician Shadowing I spent 8 hours with my father at his practice in Dayton, Ohio.  I observed as he treated patients with a wide array of illnesses., Colby College Intramural Soccer In the fall of 2004, and the spring and fall of 2005/2006 I participated in competitive intramural soccer.  In the fall of 2004 my team won the intramural championship., Premedical Summer Intern This is my summer job between junior and senior year at Miami University.  I work in the clinical research department under Dr. David Uddin, and I will be running statistical analysis for various Miami Valley Hospital research projects.  In particular I will be analyzing the Help Me Grow campaign in Montgomery County as well as various research projects submitted by physicians associated with Miami Valley Hospital."

    "text": "The doctors were dead wrong. For a moment, they could only stare into the patient's abdominal cavity, dumbfounded by what they saw. They had taken out her appendix, but she had been misdiagnosed. Gassed out on the operating table, she lay dangerously open, in need of a quick reassessment. Did she have enough time to continue the operation Enough blood Everybody looked to Dr. Chenev. He hadn't seen it coming and was ill-equipped to operate on her startling condition. But if he closed her up now, a consecutive surgery might prove disastrous. He fetched the surgical gynecologist from the adjacent chamber and after a minute of deliberation and debate, Dr. Chenev and his colleagues charged back into the woman's open cavity. Four surgeons huddled over her, collaborating tensely for a half-hour. Then all of a sudden, shouts of success rang out! I stood by and saw for the first time the source of all their agonizing. From her belly, they lugged out an ovarian tumor eight or nine inches in diameter. They cut open the cyst on a nearby tray. A green pussy substance spilled out, unloading tufts of wet hair growing inside. A rare case of teratoma! Though benign, the extricated tumor had been fatally close to rupturing and the doctors had no doubt saved her life.  This kick-started my first day at work in Ghana where I shadowed a surgical team headed by Dr. Chenev, a Bulgarian doctor. The surgical operations I encountered were astounding. Without scanning equipment or medical probes, doctors had to rely primarily on X-ray data. Each surgery was high risk due to severe blood shortages. And yet, the team handled incredible ailments seldom seen in the States such as osteomyelitis, infected hydroceles, and massive goiters. For the first time, I was exposed to the exciting methods and treatments used to confront raw disease and tropical epidemics in a core-infected region. Met by an intensely dedicated team of doctors, I was invited to learn techniques commonly used to analyze and diagnose patients. I palpitated abdomens, checked for breast lumps, identified AIDS patients, and received thorough explanations of root diseases and their resulting symptoms on a case-by-case detail. During ward rounds, medicine slowly revealed itself as an art -- a finely tuned craft demanding vigilance and a keen eye for observation. Watching the doctors in action gave me an exhilarating taste of the dynamic contribution I craved for my professional career. More than ever, I became drawn to the intellectual challenges of medicine, spurring forth an ardent desire to follow the sciences and develop a working knowledge of medicine.   Through medicine, I wish to serve others on a practical and personal level. My first experience in healthcare began at the Sunnyview Retirement Community where I worked with 20 elderly women suffering from Alzheimer's and Dementia. They were often confused and disoriented, asking for their families, and I would sadly have to remind them where they were. Every morning, I introduced myself and guided the women through their daily activities. One day while I was coordinating a word game with the vocal patients, I noticed that a woman named Francis was having difficulty breathing. Her fingers had gone cold and she complained of numbness in her arm. Fearing she might be having a heart attack, I quickly called the nurses over. When the paramedics came to rush her to the hospital, Francis adamantly refused to budge from her seat, declaring with broken speech that she was fine and wanted to stay put. I was struck intensely by her sense of dignity, moved by how boldly her personality shone through her illness. I was very relieved once she lasted the attack and glad that I had exercised the proper judgment to help Francis at a time of emergency. Yet her struggles weren't over. She, like the others, remained at the mercy of a terrible, debilitating disease, which would probably never be cured within her lifetime. All my efforts felt inadequate, dampened by the frustration that there was nothing more I could do for them.  In order to regain perspective, I decided to learn as much as I could about Alzheimer's research and current treatment methods. I talked to doctors about Alzheimer's prevention and investigated similar neurodegenerative ailments such as ALS and Parkinson's. My experience working with Alzheimer's patients motivated me to pursue a Bachelor's in Neurology, Physiology, and Behavior, through which I developed a fascination with brain dynamics, developmental hormones, and mental disorders ranging from schizophrenia to addiction. Moreover, the experience inspired me to take academic challenges head-on and taught me the value of devoted patient care.  Though regrettably the women will never remember me, I feel rewarded simply by being a part of their care and knowing I had made a difference. As an aspiring doctor, I take these lessons to heart, granting the utmost respect and dedication to the lives I aid. Geared for the challenges ahead, I believe that my devotion to reconciling illness with compassion, dignity, and determination will make me an excellent physician. I eagerly anticipate the day when I can put my formal learning to greater service. Hospital Volunteer in Africa For 5 weeks, I volunteered in Central Regional Hospital in Cape Coast, Ghana. I shadowed the hospital's surgical team and followed their emergency cases into the operating room. I also spent time in the hospital lab with other volunteers, viewing tests for infectious diseases and observing the Malaria life cycle., Research Assistant with US Forest Service For 9 months, I worked with the USDA Forest Service (interrupted briefly by Study Abroad). We manipulated bacterial genes and conducted phylogenetic analysis to study secondary growth and circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana. My role in the lab included all the necessary bench work: DNA isolation, restriction digests, gel electrophoresis, PCR, plating, and cloning transformations. I also chose genes for a future study, designed primers, and helped prepare miRNA constructs., Volunteer with Children's Development Clinic I observed and assisted occupational therapists at a children's development center. The children, ranging from 2-10 years, suffer from Autism, sensory defensiveness, attention deficit, chromosome disorders, and other developmental problems. Most of the work was done on motor planning, language development, and visual perception using specially-designed games, tools, and stimulatory devices. The occupational therapists discussed their methods, procedures, and talked about how kids responded through their program., Vice President of Bioinformatics Club I was Co-founder and Vice President of the Bioinformatics Club at UC Davis. During my term, I organized club meetings, coordinated officer meetings, recruited club members at events, and reviewed source material for presentations. We also offer Bioinformatics news updates, academic links, and Bioinformatics opportunities on our online webpage., Volunteer with Alzheimer's Unit I worked with patients in the Alzheimer's/Dementia unit of a convalescent home. I took care of patient residents with debilitated memories and motor functions, coordinated mind-stimulating activities, music, arts, and crafts, and assisted in community events for the elderly., Emergency Room Internship The ER at Sutter Memorial was a level II trauma center for women and children, with an adjoining clinic. I aided nurses and technicians during 4 hour shifts, helping and transferring patients, delivering lab samples, restocking supplies, and preparing rooms. I also got opportunities to assist with sutures, splints, EKGs, and observe CT scans."

    "text": "Growing up in a family of teachers, I had a childhood centered about exploration and discovery.  My mother merely smiled when I filled the freezer with water/spice solutions (the garlic powder mixture froze; the saltwater did not) and thus discovered freezing point depression.  She wore that same indulgent smile the day my father, also a Louisiana alligator nuisance control officer, let nine baby alligators loose in the kitchen as an animal behavior study.  Starting with this constant coaching to be curious, all of my life experiences have culminated in my desire to be a physician-scientist.  I first ventured into computer science.  My high school, as a satellite Compaq repair center, serviced over 800 laptops.  The career move seemed logical enough to my fifteen-year-old mind; I wanted to know how to fix the broken computers, and the help desk was hiring.  I interned for five months then began work as a certified computer technician, with a brief but fascinating detour in telemedicine equipment when the technology department received a small grant.  I enjoyed the challenge of diagnosis but could not shake the nagging feeling that, as appreciative as the school's resident nuns were when I created a desktop shortcut to Solitaire (their Christmas card was gushingly grateful), my abilities could be used to help others in a more meanigful way than computer repair.  Looking for a change, I applied for a position as a counselor at Louisiana Lions Camp, a summer camp for children with disabilities where my father had worked almost 30 years before.  Working with those children gave me a new focus.  Many of my campers had some sort of neurological disorder such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or spina bifida.  What these kids had to face was awful, but at the same time the ways in which they and the medical professionals who cared for them had compensated were truly inspirational and fascinating as well.  I realized that I wanted to work in medicine, and due to my interest in science I started college that fall as a biomedical engineering major with grand plans to cure spina bifida or, at the request of one of my campers, design a wheelchair with air conditioning.  Biomedical research soon appeared to be exactly the niche for me.  By the end of my freshman year I had honed in on Dr. Walter Besio's epilepsy control research because it dealt with a condition that affected my campers.  At my request, he allowed me to help out around the lab for free my sophomore year, and he gave me the neccessary materials to write a grant to fund my own project.  I found the research fascinating with the added bonus of potentially making a difference to my campers.  In the meantime, I returned to Lions Camp for a second summer.  I was helping the kids through science while still spending time with them; life was good.  However, the next year I had to choose between direct work with the kids and a more behind-the-scenes approach.  Dr. Donald Haynie, chief scientific officer of the startup company Artificial Cell Technologies, Inc., offered me a summer position as a research assistant in his lab.  After careful thought, I turned down my return request from Lions Camp and headed to New England for the summer.  The job was amazing.  I split my time between working on my own drug-release research project and doing general background work, and I loved both.  The vaccine market research opened me up to research possibilities outside of the focus on neurological disorders I had single-mindedly pursued since Lions Camp.  I found my scientific research even more exciting as I conducted trial after trial to determine the optimum thickness of ACT's drug-releasing microcapsules, though my biggest contribution to the project by the end of the summer was the discovery of numerous ways the microcapsule building and testing protocol would not work.  I learned what research was actually about, and I loved it.  But, at the same time, I missed having personal interaction with the people I was trying to help through my research.  Unexpectedly, I stumbled across the solution while looking up funding possibilities for ACT.  A search of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's website yielded a new word, physician-scientist, which instantly grabbed my attention.  I realized that my dilemma of choosing between medicine and science was not a dilemma at all, and that a need exists for physicians with the research training to apply innovations from the lab bench directly to the people in need of treatment.  With this goal in mind, I continued to work under Dr. Besio during the school year- now with my own funded research- while making the necessary preparations to become a physician as well as a researcher.   While my experience at Lions Camp made me consider being a doctor, I initially shied away from the idea.  My scientific mind wanted to understand not just how to treat medical disorders but why they existed in the first place.  As my life continued, I realized that the scientist's Why and the engineer's What am I going to do about it do not have to be separated.  I now know that the world of medicine has a place for the biomedical engineer, and I hope to fill it as a medical student and, eventually, a physician-scientist Music Ministry Co-Chair Along with my co-chair, I coordinate the music for the Sunday 7pm Student Mass at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church.  Our responsibilities include planning the music, recruiting musicians, and coordinating practices.  Since taking office, my co-chair and I have doubled the choir membership as well as raised the funds to purchase new music which we have incorporated into the Mass., Secretary, Association of Catholic Tech Students As a leader of a campus religious organization, I was responsible for leading the Catholic student community to fulfill its spiritual, community service, and fellowship goals.  As a spiritual leader, I helped to organize retreats and keep all members informed of various opportunities available.  As leader of a group committed to community service, I served as liason between the leadership team and the Social Justice committee head to direct our main service project for the year, hurricane relief.  Our student group adopted a blind refugee couple whose home had been destroyed during Hurricane Katrina.  Along with other students, I visited this couple weekly and assisted them with setting up their new home and adapting to the challenges of living without their accomodating equipment, which had been destroyed in the hurricane.  In the social arena, the entire leadership team worked to revitalize the student organization.  We planned and raised the money for a new series of weekly social events in which members took turns cooking for the group.  Once these socials were started, a new community formed, and attendence increased at our other organizational functions as well., Network/computer technician At the end of my sophomore year of high school I became an A+ certified computer technician and proceeded to work as a tech at my high school, where the tech department maintained over 800 laptops as a Compaq, then IBM, then Dell satellite service center.  I worked part-time during the school year and full-time in the summers.  As a help desk employee, I repaired laptops and also taught a Computer Applications course to high school freshmen each summer.  Just before I moved away to college, the school's network went down during a period when all of our network employees were out of the office.  I taught myself how to use the network, repaired it, and then redesigned the wireless system to be more efficient.  I was then asked to remain on the payroll as a network technician, and I returned to St. Joseph's during my school breaks to perform network maintenance and eventually a full equipment upgrade.  I was also involved in a telemedicine project my senior year of high school where we set up telemedicine equipment and conducted remote dermatology appointments between students and an off-site dermatologist as a pretrial to a rural telemedicine program., Summer Camp Counselor for children with disabilities For two full summers (2004 and 2005) I worked as a counselor at Louisiana Lions Camp, serving as a senior counselor for most of that time.  Each seven-week summer consists of one week of training, two weeks with mentally challenged campers, two weeks with physically challenged campers, and two weeks with diabetic campers.  As a senior counselor, my responsibilities include leading a patrol of 5-10 campers.  In addition to typical summer camp counselor duties, I attend to the particular needs brought on by each child's medical condition, which often includes washing, feeding, changing or seizure intervention.  During the two weeks of diabetic camp, I am a blood tester responsible for constantly carrying blood testing materials, and in the case of my younger campers, making on-site decisions to keep blood glucose concentrations at safe levels.  My first year as a counselor I was awarded the Starlight Staff Award for Excellence.  Though my position is paid, I have donated all wages earned back to Lions Camp.  After leaving Camp to do research out-of-state in 2006, I joined the Louisiana Lions Camp Staff Alumni Association to provide further support to the camp.  I am happily returning to Camp as a counselor for four weeks this summer (2007) while my research lab is closed., Habitat for Humanity Habitat for Humanity is an international organization which builds houses to give to first-time homeowners in need who largely pay for these homes by investing time in building other Habitat homes.  In high school I participated in the youth builds sponsored by my school and also worked on houses in my hometown of Port Allen.  I joined Louisiana Tech's chapter of Habitat for Humanity as a freshman.  Our chapter tries to participate in one building day each month.  Though the work days often conflict with my job, since joining the Louisiana Tech chapter I have participated in the building of four different Habitat Houses., Undergraduate Research Assistant in epilepsy research I approached Dr. Besio at the end of my freshman year because of my interest in his epilepsy research.  He allowed me to observe and help out in the lab during my sophomore year, and we co-authored a $5000 NASA-funded grant to provide for my own research project the next year, which we received.  As an undergraduate research assistant, I participate in animal tests which measure the effectiveness of concentric ring electrode stimulation in controlling induced seizures.  In these experiments I assist in equipment setup and animal preparation.  I also film the animal's behavior and then go over the video later to note the times of each seizure behavioral manifestation.   Since January we have begun brain tissue analysis as an indicator of how effectively Dr. Besio's concentric ring stimulator prevents seizure-induced brain damage.  I perfuse each test animal after experimentation and excise the brain.  I recently learned tissue staining and slide preparation techniques, and I will soon be taking over those responsibilities., Outstanding Junior, College of Engineering & Science I was nominated by my research supervisor, Dr. Besio, for this award and recognized by the Louisiana Tech University College of Engineering and Science as one of nine outstanding juniors for 2006-2007., 1st place, <20 female in full marathon In December 2005, I successfully completed a full marathon (26.2 miles) after four months of training.  I won first place in my age and gender group, though to be fair I was also the only finisher in my category., Research Assistant with sustained release microcapsules Last summer I worked as a research assistant for the biotechnology startup Artificial Cell Technologies, Inc.  My twelve weeks with ACT were split between my own research project with sustained release microcapsules and general background work for the company.  This background work mainly involved patent preparation, market research, and lab tasks such as preparing buffer solution and preparing batches of polypeptide capsules enclosing hemoglobin.  ACT eventually hopes to use its polypeptide capsule technology as an artificial red blood cell substitute.  My project goal was to determine the optimum thickness of a polypeptide microcapsule to create the sustained release of the model drug pyrene.  I prepared multiple batches of polypeptide capsules with varying thicknesses and next allowed the fluorescent drug to release for varying time periods.  I then used a fluorescence microplate reader to determine the rate at which the microcapsules released the pyrene. My summer's work yielded preliminary data as well as several modifications to the sustained release protocol., Louisiana Tech Engineering Honors student - pilot member Louisiana Tech Engineering Honors students are required to graduate with 24 hours of Honors classes, 21 of which I have completed.  As a pilot member of the Engineering Honors program, I took three introductory honors engineering courses my freshmen year.  Each of these two-credit courses required the completion of a design project.  These design projects included a self-regulating saltwater tank and a Rube Goldberg machine.  For the final project, a biomedical device was constructed which was intended to assist a person with paraplegia recover from a fall., Poster at 24th HSEMB conference Myself and five colleagues compiled a poster entitled Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation Via Concentric Ring Electrodes May Affect Later-Stage Pilocarpine-Induced Status Epilepticus at the 24th annual Houston Society for Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference., American Academy of Nanomedicine 2nd Annual Meeting poster The company Artificial Cell Technologies, Inc. presented a poster by Ling Zhang, myself, and Donald Haynie titled Study of Designed Polypeptide Multilayer Nanofilms for Controlled Drug Release at the 2nd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Nanomedicine., Member, Biomedical Engineering Society The student organization of the Biomedical Engineering Society meets monthly for lectures which explore the professional opportunities available in the field of biomedical engineering.  I attend these meetings and also participate in activities with the greater Louisiana Tech community, such as cleaning out the bioinstrumentation lab before prospective students come to tour., Cengiz Topakoglu Scholarship This $1500 award is given annually to a junior or senior undergraduate in biomedical engineering at Louisiana Tech University who has demonstrated outstanding achievement in biomedical engineering research., National Merit Scholar This award is made nationwide to approximately 8,000 high school seniors based upon PSAT performance and personal accomplishments.  As a National Merit Finalist, I attend Louisiana Tech University under a fully funded scholarship."

    "text": "A broken finger. Medicine became my career path of choice based on the fact that I broke my finger. This event reminded me why I was considering becoming a doctor in the first place. It was my first semester of college at Emory University and I was being introduced to a new world which brought about a wavering on my intended career path. I doubted whether or not I should continue down the pre-med track and began contemplating other options such as law or economics which became one of my two majors. I was in a state of confusion as to what I was to do with my life again. Then I broke my finger while tubing on a lake.  Prior to this fracture I had never broken a bone and I stubbornly claimed my finger to be swollen and not broken for days since I experienced minimal pain. Eventually, due in part to the pleading of my parents and friends, I went to the clinic to have my finger x-rayed. The next day I shockingly learned not only was my finger fractured, but that I was extremely lucky to still have my finger attached at all. This lead to a path that traversed multiple trips to two different orthopedists in differing states and hours of time spent in two surgeries not to mention therapy. This time spent away from school took a toll on my academic record due to the weeks of class I missed and this is especially reflected in my poor academic performance in Physics 151, the introductory physics course designed for majors. Yet, more importantly, this broken bone provided me with a serendipitous opportunity to remember why I had originally intended to become a doctor.  I did not always want to be a doctor. At a young age I never really considered joining the medical profession despite my father's strong suggestions; I didn't even enjoy playing the game Operation. I did always imagine and desire that I would help the world, better it in some fashion, but the idea of practicing medicine seemed too gargantuan of an idea at the time. Nonetheless, I still idealized medicine as my career path of choice at a relatively young age. I can still recall the exact time and place when I originally became committed to the pursuit of a MD. I was ten years old and in the recovery room of the children's hospital slipping in and out of consciousness; catching glimpses of my parents and nurses busily rushing about responding to what seemed like hazy noises far over the veiled imaginary horizon. It was in this semi-conscious state I resolved to become a doctor.  It was an ablation. I had earlier gone to the emergency room twice for a tachycardia that left me awake, alert, and questioning life as well as my future. These trips to the emergency room were fruitless endeavors as my tachycardia was persistent despite any of the numerous and sometimes desperate tactics employed by the emergency room doctors. The treatment options scanned the gamut from using large doses of drugs to smothering my face with bags of ice for upwards of ten minuets all to no avail. This heart condition afforded me the opportunity to experience numerous trips to several cardiologists with an eventual diagnosis of pulmonary outflow ventricular tachycardia after a couple misdiagnoses and multiple unsuccessful ablation attempts. The first was claimed as a success; however I relapsed within a month of the procedure. By the second attempted ablation, I had seen the inner workings of the hospital and had the opportunity to interact with doctors in numerous situations and I grew to enjoy these interactions. In combination with a questioning of my life and future I began to do more then just appreciate the doctoral profession.  These interactions spanning over the majority of my middle and high school years, originally committed me to the pre-med track. My resolve was renewed in my freshman year as I was inundated with the medical profession on almost a daily basis again after the fracture. In high school I volunteered at St. Ann's hospital discharging patients, running various tests to and from the lab and answering the phones. However I wanted to experience the actual profession of the doctors themselves and not a perspective of their lives. I had the opportunity to see a bountiful amount from the patient's perspective, but I wanted to see how things looked while not horizontal the majority of the time.  Thus I began to seek out more opportunities which would allow me to become intimate with the medical profession from the doctor's perspective, and not the one I had previously garnered. I spent time shadowing doctors to see what it was like from the other viewpoint and needless to say I have been enamored with the idea of becoming a doctor ever since. Having experienced the doctors life vicariously through a patient's persona helped initiate my desire for the medical profession. Experiencing the life of a doctor committed me to strive for the profession. The majority of the world strives for immaculate health and hopes of avoiding hospitals in general yet had these misfortunes not befallen upon me I would not have been exposed to the doctoral setting. If I never experienced a tachycardia or never fractured my finger I would have been deprived of the opportunity to taste the inner workings of a hospital and I would have never pinned medicine as the pursuit of my life. Organic Chemistry Lab TA As an organic chemistry lab TA I am able to assist, teach and mentor those who are struggling through the daunting course of organic chemistry. Basic duties range from prepping the lab by creating solutions and setting up certain apparatuses to teaching the proper technique used within an organic chemistry lab. Additionally I have also been asked to present lectures to the students upon the theory behind the various techniques such as extraction, a role which is normally reserved for the course instructor or graduate student. This past summer the course instructor was out of the county for the majority of the class. As such I was put in charge of an entire lab and had to not only teach the students and monitor them within the lab, but also to grade the students many of who were my peers and in some cases many years my senior. All these experiences have helped me to realize the importance of taking incentive and becoming an individual that one can rely on and come to in their time of need. It has also fostered a growing love of teaching within myself and aided me distinguishing not only the way in which I learn, but also the ways in which others learn and techniques to help in this process., Dean's List Dean's list recognizes the top twenty percent of the class for a given semester. The GPA normally required to obtain this honor is around 3.85, but it fluctuates given the pool of grades per semester. I was awarded Dean's list twice: first semester sophomore year and second semester junior year. The second semester in which dean's list was achieved occurred as I received a 4.0 GPA with a full course load in addition studying for the MCAT which was taken shortly after this semester ended., Shadowing Various Doctors Following various doctors within the group Capital City Cardiology located in Columbus Ohio, through their daily lives brought me into the life of a doctor on a daily basis. From arriving at the hospital early in the morning and conducting rounds to witnessing operations such as an aortic valve replacement, I as able to see the entire spectrum of the life encompassed by these doctors. Additionally I was provided with the unique opportunity to watch the exact procedure I had as a patient, an EP study and ablation. This was an extremely eye opening opportunity to compare and contrast the experience while on the table to standing next to the cardiologist who was narrating the procedure for my benefit. However, the most valuable experience from these day long interactions would stem from the interactions I witnessed and participated in after the operation was complete and the doctor was discussing the situation to the nervous family members. In these meetings I was able to see the elation and dismay of the patient's family, a situation I never was able to see as a patient myself. These interactions helped fill out the entire picture of the duties of a doctor spanning from the patient to the family., Indian Cultural Exchange ICE stands for Indian Cultural Exchange and is a primary way with which one can connect with their cultural heritage. This group holds functions that help connect individuals with their heritage while at the same time educating others unfamiliar with the culture. While only paying dues in my freshman year, I continued to attend functions such as the Dewali festivals where food and bangra dance are prominent every year and attempted to educate my friends about my rich cultural heritage., WMRE DJ In hosting ones own radio show one is empowered with the choice of what music to play and what to do with their hour of allotted time. With a little bit of training one is set free to do as they please with their time as long as they follow the rules. Me and one of my friends had to plan our show in advance and then were forced to execute said plan while being projected live on both an internet radio station and on the local radio TV station. Filling a much needed niche within their lineup, our show catered to dance music with a slant to the techno genre., Alpha Phi Omega- Co-ed Service Fraternity In leadership, fellowship, and service; this is APO's creed and the defining characteristic of this co-ed service fraternity. Through this organization individuals are able to pledge their time and effort to better the community by not only participating in projects, but also through the creation of volunteer opportunities for other individuals as well. This organization allowed me a diverse foray into community service with numerous projects covering all aspects of community service. From planting trees throughout the Atlanta area with Trees Atlanta to organizing and packing surplus medical supplies with MedShare International to send to less fortunate countries, this organization allowed me to enjoy community service in multiple disciplines beyond what I could have endeavored on my own. Dedicating approximately thirty hours to community service per semester is not the only advantage of this organization. In addition the friendships and skills learned in striving to find and develop more service projects for the organization makes this fraternity unique and one of the more engrossing factors in ones life., Summer Research My research has primarily been concerned with Arl2Gap, and attempting to isolate this protein along with its binding partners through the use of non-denaturing gel systems such as composite and blue native gels. The lab, never having used anything beyond SDS-Page gels, had me develop a working procedure with which to run these gels on a reliable and dependable level. Once this had been accomplished western blots were used in hopes of finding a band that would correspond to the complex protein containing Arl2Gap which could then be cut from the gel and assayed through the use of mass spectroscopy. Several problems were encountered through out the process as is to be expected while developing a working procedure for any new system. Some of the hurdles include: the search for a suitable cell line that over expresses Arl2Gap, developing a purification system which could be used on small scale with out large losses of protein while still increasing the overall specific activity of the sample, using an antibody with a low affinity for the desired protein complex to simply name a few. Per week the amount of time devoted to this was upwards of forty hours and most of this time was spent working and problem solving in an independent manner with consultation with both the PI as well as the current post doc., General Chemistry Lab Prep-Assistant The first real job that I ever had, this experience helped me to appreciate precision on an aggregate level. My duties consisted of prepping the labs for the entire general chemistry lab, which often meant making hundreds of liters of solution while still maintaining a precise molarity needed for the students' experiments to succeed. In addition to this, I also gained an appreciation for time management and problem solving. With a limited amount of funds and an increasing number of enrolled students, sometimes there simply would not be enough equipment, such as hotplates and burettes for titrations, for all the students and one would have to devise a plan which would allow all the students gain the intended knowledge from the experiment while still maintaining oneself within the designated budget., Omicron Delta Epsilon- International Economics Honor Society This international honor society for economics not only recognizes excellence within the field of economics but also works to bridge the gap between academic research, the workplace, and the student of the science. This society allows for interactions between students, faculty members and professionals within the field in order to garner a better understanding of the interconnectedness of the disciplines despite the differing implied practices. These normally informal interactions are situated over dinner or more social settings allowing students to practice networking and discussing economics on a more theoretical and practical level then what is normally presented in class."

    "text": "After much reflection, I have determined that I can use my talents best as a physician.  My first exposure to medicine was through my mother, who was a nurse.  From a young age, I was encouraged to be open and comfortable speaking about any physical or emotional problems I had, and my mother has always shared her knowledge of medicine with me.  From these experiences and several others, I have decided to become a physician. I enjoy medical science, I am an effective leader, and I have an innate desire to lessen the suffering of others. I have become increasingly confident that medicine is my vocation.  As I learn more in the classroom and from life experiences about the intricacies of human life, I realize just how much more there is to learn, and I am excited that I will obtain this knowledge as I further study medicine.  In almost every Physiology lecture, I learned about a biological pathway or a cellular function that helped me put together the puzzle of the human body a little more, and the drive to complete this puzzle pushes me on to medical school.  Also, I volunteer primarily as a translator at La Clinca, a bilingual medical clinic in St. Louis.  There I am able to see how physicians assess medical problems and determine the best ways to solve them.  They use a deductive, scientific logic that pulls from their experiences as well as recent research.  My mind works in a similar scientific way.  With each problem I face, I use what I have learned and any other knowledge available to me to find the best solution.  I enjoy researching alternatives and I often seek the advice of others if I cannot come to the best answer on my own. I see the study and practice of medicine as a combination of scientific inquiry and human experience that seeks to heal.  This synthesis is what I desire in my future career.  From my observations, physicians lead the treatment process, but they must also work collectively with patients, their loved ones, and other health-care providers to offer the best care.  I have developed this sort of leadership that respects the group it serves through acting as a student advisor to the Advisory Board of Micah House, a service-learning community.  In this position, I attend Advisory Board meetings with the faculty and staff who teach in, advise, and direct the program.  In these meetings, I voice my opinions as well as those of my fellow students, and, afterwards, I inform the other students in the program about what we discussed.  From this experience, I have learned how to listen attentively to the concerns of others, work within a bureaucracy to solve problems, and cooperate with many people to bring about change.  I would not feel satisfied with my experience in the Micah House if I was not able to have a leading role in enriching the program.  Similarly, I will not feel fulfilled unless my future profession allows me to be influential in improving the lives of others.    I have seen pain in the faces of many people, and instead of feeling helpless, I want to become a physician to help them find relief.  I feel a nurturing impulse to care for those around me.  Both my mother and my grandfather have dealt with many health problems recently, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to assist in taking care of them.  I have spent many days and nights in the hospital with them, paying close attention to the treatment they receive from their doctors.  Now that they both are home, I have experienced the important role of the family in patient care, while I yearn to be able to offer more than company.  Furthermore, I have seen the sufferings of people who are poor, and I want to ease their struggles especially.  In the summer of 2005,  I spent 10 weeks in El Salvador, working with an organization that promotes health in rural communities.  I lived in one of these communities and investigated the contamination of the river that was vital to life there. A doctor only visited once every two months, and the people could not afford most of the medicine he prescribed.  In the future, I want to bring my knowledge of medicine to those who need it the most. I will also benefit from meeting individuals from many backgrounds who will help me to understand better the world and those who live in it.  I want a profession where I am able to recognize both physical and societal illness on a personal level and be equipped with the knowledge and compassion to offer a solution to those who are ailing. I have seen many people suffering both at home and abroad, so I want to pursue a career where I can most intimately offer relief.    For all of these reasons, I desire to become a physician to combine my most developed strengths in order to bring care and compassion to those who need it most.  I could serve humanity in many ways, but I believe that I have found my vocation in medicine. Volunteer on Orthopedic Floor of the Christ Hospital During the end of my Junior year, through the summer and in the beginning of my Senior year of high school, I volunteered on the orthopedic floor at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati.  I was just beginning to consider becoming a physician and I was looking for some experience to help me decide what I wanted to major in in college.  At the Christ Hospital, I enjoyed learning from the doctors I met.  Each one provided me with helpful insights from their personal experiences in the medical field., Summer Internship with CRISPAZ For 10 weeks, I lived in El Salvador with a family in a rural community.  I went as one of 5 summer interns with CRISPAZ, Christians for Peace in El Salvador.  We were each sent to different communities.  I worked with a Salvadoran organization called APROCSAL, which promotes health in the rural communities to the north of the capital.  I helped them in an investigation of a factory called El Pipil, which produces tomatoes, bell peppers and other fruits and vegetables using hydroponics for export to Canada and in 2005 they were waiting for the signing of CAFTA in order to be able to export to the US.  I was investigating the chemicals they were using as pesticides, which were causing contamination in the river that ran through my community.  By speaking to several workers in the factory, I learned of the unpleasant conditions they worked in for just $5 a day.  Through my work with APROCSAL, I also learned about the herbal medicines they produced and how they can only afford to provide a doctor to communities like mine once every two months.  In the community I also helped in the kindergarten class and taught English in the afternoon.  I have been forever changed by my experience in El Salvador.  Because of this experience, I plan to work as a doctor in a Latin American country in the future., Coordinator of St. Louis University's Just Earth! Club I have acted as the coordinator for the St. Louis University Just Earth! Club since the beginning of my Junior year.  I was also a member of the club during my freshman and sophomore years.  This club attempts to promote environmental sustainability on St. Louis University's campus, which includes improving recycling services as well as educating the SLU community about the state of the environment and what we can do to improve it.  This year we began working with the Environmental Task Force of the Student Government Association.  We are building a university-wide committee on environmental sustainability and stewardship.  Another initiative this year was to improve the salvage drive at the end of the year to collect goods that would otherwise be thrown away. We also sponsor an Earth Day Fair on campus as well as a table at the St. Louis Earth Day festival at Forest Park each year.  Through these activities, I have learned a great deal about our impact on the environment and about how to lead a group., Server/Waitress at a Mexican Restaurant I have worked as a waitress during the summer and on breaks at a Mexican restaurant.  This has greatly improved my Spanish skills, since I am the only server born in the U.S., as well as my understanding of the experience of being an immigrant.  I have also improved my memory, time management, and interpersonal skills., ER Volunteer at Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center I volunteered in the Emergency Department at Cardinal Glennon  Hospital as a part of the COVE Internship offered at St. Louis University for a total of 60 hours. (COVE stands for Career Opportunities and Vocational Education.)  My shift was from 7 until 10 on Tuesday nights. I kept a journal of my experiences and wrote a paper on what I had learned at the end.  In one of my journal entries, I wrote, One of the things I am beginning to become more conscious of is that in becoming a physician, I will not only learn about the human body but also the human condition - how each person's experiences are so varied yet so similar at the same time.  Every person suffers in their own way, and medicine is one way to try to understand and find healing for suffering., Presidential Scholarship to St. Louis University I was awarded the Presidential Scholarship, which is a full-tuition scholarship, to St. Louis University, where I attend.  I have also been active in the Presidential Scholar Society, where I have served on the service committee., University of Notre Dame's Joy in the Truth Conference I was chosen to present a paper on the Micah House Program of St. Louis University at the 2005 Joy in the Truth: The Catholic University in the New Millennium Conference.  The Conference was hosted by the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture.  It was an amazing opportunity to hear from some of the professors whose books and papers I had read for class.  Also, I was able to share my experience in the Micah House Program.  The Micah House is named for this verse from the book of Micah in the Hebrew Scriptures of the Bible: And what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God  The Micah House attempts to accomplish this mission in a living and learning community of 25-30 freshman each year.  The freshman take a Theology, Philosophy, English and Urban Crisis class together.  Their studies are combined with a volunteer experience in a poor urban neighborhood.  I served as a tutor at an elementary school near campus, which I greatly enjoyed.  After freshman year, Micah students are no longer required to take similar classes or live together, but because of the community that was created their freshman year, they often do.  Not only did I find a supportive community as I was beginning college, I also learned about poverty, service and love., Member of Alpha Epsilon Delta I was initiated as a member of Alpha Epsilon Delta on February 18, 2006.  However, I was participating in the St. Louis University Pre-health Club's activities during my freshman year as well.   As a member of this group, I have not only found good friends who are also preparing to go to Medical School, but I have also had the opportunity to meet physicians and hear about their experiences., Member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society I was initiated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa on April 26, 2007.  Phi Beta Kappa, founded on December 5, 1776, is an honor society that celebrates and advocates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences., Translator/Intake Volunteer at Hispanic Medical Clinic I work as a translator for doctors who volunteer at the clinic who do not speak Spanish.  I also often help with patient intake, which includes measuring height and weight and taking vital signs as well as patient histories.  I enjoy this work, especially for the amount of medical experience and knowledge I am exposed to., Tutor at Karen House (Catholic Worker House) Karen House is a Catholic Worker community established 27 years ago. The eight community members offer their home, which used to be a convent, to 25-30 homeless women and children in north St. Louis.  I helped to continue and restore the tutoring program there with two of my friends.  We would arrive at Karen House 30 minutes before the children would get home from school to prepare a healthy snack and clean the dining room so we could have a clean place to work and study.  The tutoring was varied based on each child's need.  Each one presented us with a unique challenge, but I enjoyed the opportunity to get to know each one because their experience growing up was different from mine - they experienced many more obstacles., Member of Pax Christi Pax Christi (Peace of Christ) is an international nonviolence organization founded in Europe after World War II.  At St. Louis University, we have a chapter of Pax Christi that meets once a week to reflect on peace, nonviolence and community on campus, in the United States and  throughout the world.  With Campus Ministry, we sponsor a trip each year to the gates of WHINSEC (Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation), which used to be called the School of the Americas, to call for the school to be closed.  People trained there have returned to their home countries, primarily in Central and South America, where they have committed many human rights violations.  We have also held weekly peace vigils as an outlet to pray for peace.  This group acts as a voice on campus for social justice and as a community for those who want to work for it., St. Louis University's Campus Kitchen Leadership Team St. Louis University is home to the first Campus Kitchen. We use  a kitchen that used to serve a dining hall in one of the residence halls on campus.  Students prepare meals using food donated from campus dining halls, the local food bank, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods.  Then, students deliver meals free of charge to individuals and agencies around the St. Louis community.  This has been my primary duty.  Student volunteers also provide empowerment-based education to clients, including culinary job training classes to unemployed adults.  As a member of the leadership team for Campus Kitchen, I have learned tangible ways to end hunger in my own community.  I have also learned the hunger for company of many older people.  I deliver meals to an apartment complex that qualifies as section 8 housing, and I have learned a great deal from its residents about hunger, medical care in this country, and hope., Msgr. John A. Shocklee Interfaith Social Justice Award This award recognizes valuable contributions to interfaith social action initiatives.  I was nominated on behalf of the Theology Department at St. Louis University and was one of two winners this year."

    "text": "As I looked into the eyes of these many women, I could see a depth of emotions in their faces - looks of fear, anxiousness, nervousness, happiness, hope, pain, or sorrow. I followed behind Dr. Osuagwu as we entered each room and she introduced me as a student who was interested in medicine and asked permission from each patient that I observe their visit that day. A few patients declined my presence in the room, for they may have been too shy or felt their situation was too personal for my observation. When I was given the opportunity to shadow I had no idea that it would allow me to gain a new understanding of a physician and the role they have in their patient's life.  My first day of shadowing began by observing regular routine annual examinations and prenatal care. However, there was one particular patient that allowed me the opportunity that I shall not soon forget. She was a tall thin woman in her thirty's who was anxiously awaiting a surgical procedure that was to take place in a few weeks. I soon discovered that this patient was no stranger to the operating room. Though this was not her first time in the operating room it would be my very first. During her visit I watched and was in awe as Dr. Osuagwu explained the pre-surgical procedures while easing the patient's worries and providing assurance and comfort.  What I observed subsequently in the operating room was in no comparison to anything I have seen or experienced before. Yes, I can admit that I enjoy watching popular shows such as E.R. which depict a hospital setting that plays out an enticing drama-filled medical scenario into a one hour show. However, the reality of standing less than five feet from a patient that I shared a conversation with three weeks earlier, and watching as the doctors made the first incision into her lower abdomen diminished the glamour seen on TV. I became thoroughly engaged in the procedure that was taking place before me. The patient was undergoing a total abdominal hysterectomy. As I stood there I thought to myself this patient has a family, a career, and a life that was awaiting her after successful recovery from this procedure. At that instant reality hit me and I became aware of the actual magnitude of a doctor's role in their patient's life, a role I wanted to play.   My initial passion for medicine began simply through my innate love of science. Each class allowed for a new discovery into the functions of the human body. As my interest grew I sought out opportunities that would extend beyond the classroom. I applied and was accepted into the OSEA Glenn-Stokes Research Internship. The idea that I may have an opportunity to interact and learn from faculty on the cutting edge of research was thrilling. Research with Dr. Brout on the investigation into intraovarian biochemical changes leading to follicular cyst development further stimulated my curiosity. Though I enjoy the excitement of novel bench research I realized that day in Dr. Osuagwu's office that the lab's distant analytical approach doesn't allow me to interact or show compassion to patients, so I sought more clinical experience.   As I think back to that day in the operating room it was then that I was able to whole-heartedly commit my life to becoming a doctor. The surgical procedure that I observed lasted about four hours. As I stood in the operating room at the end of the surgery I asked myself, Am I aware of the actual commitment and dedication needed to practice medicine and improve the lives of many people I believe that I am. My experience as a graduate student in the Medical Sciences Program at Boston University School of Medicine has reaffirmed my personal commitment along with strengthening my academic knowledge and credentials. By taking medical school courses I am aware of the hard work required to be successful in a rigorous medical school curriculum. I also gained valuable experience as a clinical research assistant at the Boston Medical Center where I was involved in a study which explored the knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of the HPV vaccine among a cohort of racially diverse patients in the Boston area. I elected to write my masters thesis on this study focusing on racial and sociodemographic barriers related to parental acceptability of the HPV vaccine. Because of the quality of my thesis and research work my PI recommended that my thesis be considered for honors and plans to include me as an author on a final publication. \t  From my experiences, I have realized that yes, both research and clinical medicine are equally important. Medicine allows for clinical observation and analysis of symptoms but without research the main pursuit of the physician to treat their patients would not be possible. My experiences have allowed me to incorporate both aspects of this into my education which will undoubtedly benefit me as a future medical student and physician. I know that medicine is a lifelong commitment. It involves hard work and a never ending hunger to improve oneself and improve the health of our society. It involves the ability to communicate and it involves teamwork. But most importantly, I learned that day in the operating room, it involves a profound sincerity to make a positive impact in your patient's life. Kent State University Mentoring Program As a peer mentor I was paired up with an incoming freshman for the 2005-2006 school year. My goal as a peer mentor was to use my experiences and knowledge as an upperclassman to give sound advice and to make my mentee's transition from high school to college a smooth one. I met with my freshman peer numerous times through out the year. We engaged in study and tutoring sessions, and I was able to help with time management, as well as how to deal with the academic and social issues experienced by many incoming freshman., Ohio Science & Engineering Glenn-Stokes Research Internship I applied and was accepted into the Ohio Science and Engineering Alliance Glenn-Stokes Research Internship. I completed my paid research internship during the 2005/2006 academic year. I worked one-on-one with my faculty advisor, Dr. Brent Bruot. Our project explored the effects of perchlorate a contaminate found in drinking water and its effect on ovarian cyst development in hypothyroid rats. Some of my duties consisted of sacrificing of the rats, ovary extraction, histologic examination of the ovaries, measuring thyroid hormone levels, and conducting progesterone and estrogen assays. I completed my research internship with the writing of an abstract a research paper and by presenting my results at the 2nd Annual Research Symposium held at Kent State University., KSU Undergraduate Research Poster Competition I presented my research poster at Kent State's Annual Research Symposium on April 16, 2006. I was third author of the poster. Our research project explored the effects of perchlorate, a contaminate found in public drinking water and its effect on ovarian cyst formation in hypothyroid rats. My presentation and poster won 2nd place in the undergraduate poster competition., Physician Shadowing at Doctors Hospital West I shadowed Dr. Ngozi Osuagwu at Doctors Hospital West, Columbus, OH from December 2005 to January 2006 for 6-7 hrs. per day. The experience allowed me to obtain exposure to a doctor's daily routine. I was also able to observe a total abdominal hysterectomy surgical procedure., Cleveland Clinic Ambassador I volunteered as a Cleveland Clinic Ambassador for about 7 months in the Cleveland Clinic Emergency Department. Although this hospital was about a 40 minute drive from Kent where I went to school I choose this hospital because of the fast pace of the city and the diverse patient population. This was one of my very first experiences working in a clinical setting. My role there was to provide assistance in any way possible to the patients and their families, the nurses, physicians and staff. As an ambassador some of my specific responsiblities were to escort or assist patients to their rooms, organize papers and supplies and assist in patient registration and other various tasks. What amazed me about my experience as an ambassador was how much my help was appreciated by the staff as well as the patients. I loved the fact that I was able to lend a helping hand to anyone who needed it. I spent most of my time in the triage but also found myself in the waiting room where I was simply there for someone to talk to or confide in. I particularly loved the fast pace atmosphere and the team work illustrated by the staff. What really fascinated me about emergency medicine was the huge range of conditions that arrived into the emergency room on a daily basis., National Dean's List I was a national dean's list recipient which recognizes students that receive a semester GPA of 3.4 or above., Ebony Achievement Award I was awarded the Ebony Achievement Award for outstanding academic achievement and contribution to the Kupita Transiciones Program. I recieved this award in April 2005. This award was particularly important because it is awarded annually to minority students who show great leadership and involvement in the multicultural center at Kent State University as well as those who maintain a grade point average of 3.3 and above., Phi Delta Epsilon Medical Fraternity I was inducted into Phi Delta Epsilon Medical Fraternity (PhiDE) during my sophomore year in college. PhiDE is an internationally recognized medical fraternity. I joined this fraternity because of its mission to foster and promote fellowship, mentoring, equality and unity within the medical community. As an incoming freshman I was drawn to this organization because it allowed me to interact and learn from individuals that had the same goals and aspirations as myself. I began attending meetings and social events hosted by PhiDE and gained a better understanding of PhiDE and its mission. This group not only fostered relationships within the medical community but a big part of their mission is to also reach out to those in need by volunteering and community service. During my time as a member of PhiDE I was able to participate in food and clothing drives, walkathons and fundraisers. This experience allowed me to foster strong relationships with other members of the fraternity. It also allowed me to serve and help individuals in our community who were less fortunate and in need of our services., Akron Children's Hospital Academic Associate Program In a highly intense atmosphere such as an Emergency Department I was able to interact with physicians and patients while assisting in six ongoing clinical research projects. At Akron Children's Emergency Department I volunteered as a clinical research assistant during the spring semester of my senior year. My role was to identify patients as potential clinical research participants. I also conducted surveys and collected data from physicians and/or charts. The experience allowed me to gain exposure into a fast pace environment where I was responsible for handling multiple tasks and being quick on my feet along with aiding and assiting patients and their families., Kupita Transiciones Kupita Transiciones is a week long orientation program for newly admitted African American, Latino and Native American students at Kent State University. It is a retention program geared towards minority incoming freshmen and its goal is to allow students to address academic, social, and cultural issues while making the transition from high school to college an easier one. The program allows students to move in a week before orientation to become familiar with the campus, faculty and upperclassmen. During the prelude to my freshman year I was a participant of Kupita Transiciones. This program along with the faculty and upperclassmen really made my transition to college a smooth and exciting experience. This is what drove me to participate as a peer mentor and group leader each year thereafter. I played numerous roles during the week long program such as leading culturally relevant and academic success workshops and social activities. The experience allowed me to enhance my leadership skills, demonstrate team work, and meet a new and diverse group of individuals. It also allowed me to use my past experiences to support, counsel and guide the incoming students as they transitioned into college., Boston Medical Center Clinical Research Assistant My interest in ethnic health disparities led me to proactively seek an opportunity to work on a related clinical research project at the Boston Medical Center. The study examined attitudes knowledge and acceptance of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among minority and non-English speaking parents and adolescents. I volunteered between 10 to 15 hours a week. My responsibilities included interviewing patients about HPV vaccination, conducting medical record review, and contributing to team meetings and qualitative data analysis. I was very passionate about the clinical research project that I contributed to. It allowed me to combine my interest in womens health and health disparities. An understanding of the health-related beliefs, attitudes, and practices of people of different cultures is important because it can help break down cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as improve services and close ethnic gaps in health status., Kent State's 2nd Annual Research Symposium The Kent State University Department of Biological Sciences host it's annual research symposium every spring semester. The symposium gives both faculty and students an opportunity to present posters, give presentations and engage in an open forum for discussion of research projects. I presented my research poster at the symposium on April 16th 2006. My research examined ammonium perchlorate, a contaminate found in public drinking water and its effect on ovarian cyst formation in hypothyroid rats., Master of Arts in Medical Science Honors Thesis Thesis title: Racial & Sociodemographic Barriers Related to Parental Acceptability of the Human Papillomavirus Vaccine.  I conducted my thesis research under the direction of Dr. Rebecca Perkins, Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Our research study explored the knowledge, attitudes and acceptance of HPV vaccination among minority and non-English speaking patients in the Boston area. The study used in depth interviews to elicit attitudes from a racially diverse cohort of parents and adolescents to discover what factors relate to parental acceptablity of the HPV vaccine in these groups. My thesis focused on racial and sociodemographic differences in HPV vaccination rates and acceptance. I used a multivariable linear regression model  and the Health Behavior Model to determine significant independent predictors of HPV vaccine acceptance or actual reciept of the vaccine. In the study we were able to determine several important independent correlates of HPV vaccine acceptance in our study sample. This study is useful in its attempt to develop educational interventions to promote acceptance of the HPV vaccine and to evaluate strategies to improve vaccination rates and reduce existing disparities in cervical cancer incidence."

    "text": "Understanding is everything in medicine.  I am interested in becoming a doctor not only so I can learn more about the human body, but also so I can help patients be aware of and understand their own conditions.  Having two engineers as parents has fueled my passion for science, and moving eight times before college has given me a great understanding of different cultures so that I am able to relate with many different peoples.  Becoming a doctor would allow me to continue my quest for more knowledge of science and to enlighten patients about medicine so they can be a part of their own healthcare.  For as long as I can remember, I have enjoyed taking science classes and participating in hands-on laboratories.  In my eighth grade science class, at Jakarta International School, we had a Solar Constant project where we built our own apparatus to collect heat from sunlight in order to calculate this constant.  Thinking of ways to perform different experiments or do different things really intrigues me, and I get excited about discovering new information, even if it is new information just to me.  Throughout my high school years, in both Indonesia and Canada, I signed up for all of the science classes I could take and found that I really enjoyed chemistry and biology.  Even though I was not sure exactly what the Biochemistry major was all about at Clemson University, I knew it would fit my personality.  After excelling in my first year of classes at Clemson, I was allowed to start research in a laboratory in the Biochemistry and Genetics Department to study the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes the devastating African Sleeping Sickness.  Although I have thoroughly enjoyed my experiences for the past two years in the lab, and am looking forward to another semester of it, I know that graduate school and a career working in a lab is not for me.  Taking my metabolism class sophomore year, though, helped me figure out that medicine is the correct choice for me.  When I started learning about the different systems in the body, I began to be able to answer questions my mom would ask me about sicknesses or medications, and I felt excited when I could explain the answers to her so that she could understand it all.  At that point I started thinking that I need to do something in my life where I can help others by helping them understand. \t Growing up with my grandfather and one of my uncles as doctors, I had an idea of how the medical profession works.  Because of my uncle, I am now actually very interested in family medicine.  When I started thinking about applying to medical school, my uncle took me to work to show me his practice and the residency program he is involved with.  Talking with him, I started to see that, as a doctor, I would get that interaction with patients where I could really help them by talking to them and informing them about all aspects of their illnesses.  While practicing medicine, I would still be learning more, as doctors continue to study new procedures and medications throughout their careers.  Last semester, at Clemson, I was chosen from a pool of applicants and was given the opportunity to take a clinical applications class.  During the course of the class, we listened to lectures given by many different types of doctors and shadowed doctors at the hospital in Greenville, SC.  Although I am still very much interested in family medicine, I discovered that other fields of medicine also sparked my interest, and my desire to attend medical school was reaffirmed.  This past summer, I jumped at the chance shadow a family friend, who is an orthopedic surgeon.  During the course of the day, I observed him as he met with patients and performed two surgeries.  Once again, I saw how important understanding is for both the doctor and patient.  As a surgeon, I would want to be aware of all parts of the surgery and the patient's conditions, and in order for my patient to be comfortable for surgery, I would want them to completely understand why they would need the procedure and all that would take place during the process. \t One important attribute that I feel I have that would help me in the medical profession is my ability to relate with many different peoples.  Ever since the third grade, I have had the chance to relate to people from different backgrounds and cultures.  Living overseas opened my eyes up to the whole world around me.  There are so many fascinating cultures and points of views on different subjects.  Because I was able to experience living around world as a child, I am able to relate, in some way or another, with most people I meet.  Since medicine is about being able to work with a diverse array people and help them understand, all of my travels have greatly benefited me. \t With all of my life experiences and everything that has surrounded me while growing up, I cannot think of anything else to do with my life besides working in medicine.  I thirst for more knowledge in science everyday and want to do my part in the healthcare system by caring for and passing on understanding to my patients. President's List I have earned a 4.0 GPA and been named to the President's List for the following semesters: Fall 2004, Spring 2005, Fall 2005, Spring 2006, Fall 2006, Spring 2007, Intramural Sports I played on coed volleyball and softball teams during the fall and spring semesters of my freshman year, and I was part of an all-female soccer team fall of my sophomore year., SC LIFE Colloquium of Undergraduate Research I presented my research from the past year to students and professors from Clemson University, Benedict College, Claflin University, and Morris College.  I also attended the colloquium held at Clemson University in April 2006 to present my research from the year before., Running I started running in middle school and continue to run to keep in shape and to spend time outside., Waitressing I waited tables and waitressed for private parties at the country club., Scholarships I was awarded the Trustee Scholarship, Colonel George F. Parker Scholarship, and Out-of-State Tuition Scholarship totaling to $4750 per semester for 8 semesters., Dixon Fellows I was selected my freshman year to be involved with the Dixon Fellows program, which is a mentoring program with approximately 80 junior fellows (students) and 10 senior fellows (faculty).  Students meet in small groups about twice a month to discuss current events, attend cultural events, or listen to a speaker.  Several Dixon Fellows also travel to different cities around the country once a year.  My freshman year, the group traveled to Boston to see performances and visits different museums., Cashier I worked as a cashier., Temporary Employment Work I worked both as an auditor at UPS and a secretary at a sales office., Physician Shadowing In February, I shadowed Dr. Cathy Hunt, who is a family physician in Greenville, SC.  I was able to talk with Dr. Hunt and observe the chief resident in her program meet with patients.  In June, I shadowed Dr. Joseph Misson, who is an orthopedic surgeon in Lima, OH.  I observed Dr. Misson meet with patients and watched two different surgeries., Student Research The lab I am involved with works with the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African Sleeping Sickness.  I have been given my own projects to work on and am also currently working on a project with a graduate student.  My experience includes incorporating Trypanosome DNA into E. coli, expressing recombinant proteins, running DNA on agarose gels, running protein on SDS-PAGE gels, and purifying protein.  During my sophomore year I started working with the protein AMP-Dependent Kinase, and currently my project involves the hexokinase protein."

    "text": "When I was in seventh grade, I participated in an after-school club called Science Olympiad.  In this club we learned about many aspects of science including biology, engineering, genetics, botany, and even chemistry.  Out of all the categories that I particicpated in, my favorite was the Science of Fitness category.  I, myself, am not a fitness fanatic, but I enjoyed the topics of health and medicine, anatomy, and physiology I was exposed to.  Our coach for that category was a pediatrician and he possessed such a wealth of knowledge that it still astounds me to this day.  Although I had always wanted to be a doctor before that year, exposure to that information further motivated me to become one.      I have always done well in and been fascinated with health and medicine, as well as biology, anatomy, and physiology, but my desire to be a doctor goes beyond that.  I want to become someone who devotes his life to helping others, to have a fulfilling and enriching life of service, and to have the potential and opportunity to do something great.  A life as a doctor of medicine is precisely the life of service, dedication, and education that I want to have.      First, serving others is what I was born to do.  I constantly put others first and go out of my way to make people happy.  Caring for people in need of my help and making them happy essentially makes me happy.  My life has always revolved around doing the best that I can for others.  As a doctor I will be able to fulfill that need to serve on a daily basis.  As a medical professional, I can live a fulfilling life making others happy and healthy.      But there is more about medicine that provides a chance to live a fulfilling life than serving others.  I can also serve myself.  Becoming a doctor would fulfill not only my dreams, but the dreams of many people in my family who have never even been to college, or graduated from high school.  I not only want to become a doctor for myself, but for those who believe in me.  Achieving my goal of becoming a doctor satisfies a sense of accomplishment that my family has strived for for generations.  A life in the medical field provides distinction, honor, and a vast wealth of knowledge that I've worked hard to attain for myself, and my family.      Finally, becoming a doctor will give me the potential and the opportunity to do something great.  Opportunities are abound in the field of medicine in today's society.  Issues such as public health and poverty, healthcare and age, new diseases, and medical technology provide many challenges to face and opportunities to become significant.  As a doctor I will have the ability to effect the lives of many people, and hopefully, to imrove society.  Although it sounds cliche, I want to be a doctor for the chance to change the world.      To me, being a doctor represents ambition, hardwork, dignity, service, education, and fulfillment.  Above all else, it represents accomplishment.  As a doctor, I can fulfill my desire to do good things, to help others, to provide pride and dignity for my family, and to face present and future challenges.  I want to go to medical school and become a doctor because I love life and I want to give back to it.

It was a phylogenetics research project which focused on the evolution of amphibians.  I participated in several conferences, including the Denman Research Forum, which is held at Ohio State every year.  This project was exciting to me and allowed me to experience the life of a research scientist first hand., Ohio Science and Engineering Internship I was awarded an internship from the Ohio Science and Engineering Alliance.  This internship was designed to provide research experience to minority undergraduate students. During my summer as an intern, I conducted phylogenetic research on amphibians.

    "text": "I used to think that being a physician meant writing prescriptions and performing procedures, but now I know that this belief is oversimplified. My many life experiences as well opportunities to shadow and work in clinical research have taught me otherwise. Physicians act not only as healers, but also as scientists, educators, community leaders, and mentors. I have witnessed the outcomes that culturally competent care and real concern can have on patients, trainees, and colleagues. This has inspired me to apply to medical school with the hope that I ultimately will be given the opportunity to practice medicine in the same compassionate and thoughtful manner.   Through shadowing numerous physicians in an effort to solidify fields of medicine that interest me the most, I have learned invaluable lessons of character. I witnessed the passion that one primary care physician had for helping his patients achieve health and wellness -- not only physically, but also mentally, spiritually, and emotionally. I admired the fact that he was less concerned with adhering to appointment time constraints and more with ensuring that his patients fully understood their diagnoses and treatment plans. Many of his patients repeatedly spoke of how he has changed their outlook on health. I have applied these qualities in my current position as a clinical research coordinator by connecting with our study participants on a personal level, educating them on research procedures, and helping them to navigate other services of which they are in need. Further, I challenge their health beliefs with practical examples and offer them a culturally sensitive alternative perspective.   The intersection of medicine, science, politics, and business, created by the health care reform, requires physicians to grasp and use knowledge outside of their respective specialties and to work in a collaborative manner. In anticipation of medicine's evolution, I believed it to be prudent to pursue training in health care administration. Through my current program, I have learned valuable lessons in health care organizational structure, law and ethics, as well as gained a greater understanding of all the entities affecting the medical field. My experiences as a research coordinator in both the asthma clinic and local neighborhood communities have mirrored these lessons and drastically augmented my level of comprehension and aptitude towards science, ethics, and health information.  I am not a traditional student. In high school and as an undergraduate, I worked multiple jobs while taking classes in order to support myself, my mother, and younger siblings. During my senior year of college, I enrolled in extra science classes to expand my breadth of knowledge and better prepare myself for medical school. Unfortunately, that year, my mother entered a drug rehabilitation program which forced me to focus more on meeting household expenses and caring for my younger siblings during her absence. I withdrew from classes and added more work hours to compensate. The impact that parental absence has on children is well documented and as an African-American, the statistics are even more distressing. There was no question that I had to step in and become a surrogate parent, mentor and educator for my younger siblings.   As I look back on these and other past experiences, I have seen the impact compassionate intervention can manifest and what impact I am able to leave on other people. Sometimes it is necessary to put our own personal wants and goals aside so that we may serve the needs of others. In my case, I saw the potential to improve the lives of my siblings before I pursued my own dreams. From these hard times, I know that I am capable of making hard decisions, sacrificing, and being flexible. Fortunatley, I have been able to create a positive and nurturing environment for my siblings over the past few years, allowing me the opportunity to move forward and accomplish my own goals. Persevering to overcome challenges, particularly during situations of extreme stress, has been a reoccurring theme in my life and has given me a unique perspective on the situations of other racial minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged people. I have often been in their shoes. Undoubtedly, these learned attributes will be valuable to me throughout medical school and beyond.    For these reasons, I am confident that I will be able to serve my community as a physician. I want to be an instrument in improving access to quality health care services in underserved populations, and to model for my fellow health professionals what culturally competent care achieves. I want to engage communities through research and outreach with the goal of empowering them to close the health gap between socioeconomic classes. I envision myself in a clinic setting that encourages collaborative health education, research, and disease prevention. Just as important, I would promote mentoring and shadowing programs for youth who share my dream of medicine, but also lack a family support system and resources. I know in my heart that it is simply not enough for me to touch the top of the ladder, but equally important for me to reach back to those on the rung below. African-American Professional Advisory Council (AAPAC) AAPAC serves as an employee resource group for people of color at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. As part of the leadership team, it is my role to encourage our membership to become involved in one of our 5 focus areas; global development, networking, community outreach, fundraising, and education and professional development.  Together with the Department of Diversity, we are charged with organizing events for Black History Month and numerous community engagement efforts focused on minority populations. I have benefited tremendously from this group by gaining valuable leadership skills, cultural education and health care management knowledge., American Cancer Society Committee Member/Team Leader ACS has always held a deep place in my heart because I have several family members who suffered from cancer and it is also a national initiaive of my sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Inc. I have been a team leader in their breast cancer walk for past several years, and recently joined the local Daffodil Days Committee. This campaign provides hand-delivered flowers and gifts to cancer patients and survivors. Through my committee participation, I reach out to the community to levy support from other organizations to help with our initiative. It has been more than rewarding to give strength and hope to others dealing with the emotions that I once went through as I cared for my family members,  Clinical Research Coordinator, Access to Health Care Project Leader Core Change is an initiative pioneered by Dr. Victor Garcia at Children's Hospital. The mission of the Core Change movement is to make A better life for each, a better Cincinnati for all. Together people from all walks of life have joined Core Change in an attempt to sustain systemic solutions aimed at urban poverty, effective civic investment by the residents most impacted by those conditions, and shared accountability for urban problems among those who live outside the core. I have committed to aid in this effort by taking on the role of project leader for the Access to Health Care Working Group. I joined this movement to be part of the change, rather than a bystander.,  Exhibit Programming Specialist, Clinical Research Coordinator in Division of Asthma Research For the past three years, I have served as a research coordinator for several projects in the Division of Asthma Research. Most of our studies focus on outcomes based on gene and environment interactions but we have also expanded to meet community needs with projects focusing on health literacy and beliefs. I have been fortunate enough to work on studies from the initial grant submission and set up through study closing. This has allowed me experience with the IRB, patient contact, sample processing, and data collection and analysis. My time at Children's has shown me the value of seeing scientific research start at the bedside, move to the bench, and then influence clinical practice., Clinical Studies Assistant I began working with the UC Emergency Physicians group during college to gain clinical experience and practical exposure to the field of medicine. While there, I focused on investigational device trials in cardiology and neurology. Through this opportunity I was able to shadow physicians during the times when we did not have eligible patients and was exposed to events from violent trauma to death. Working in the ED confirmed that I would be able to sustain through long hours within a stressful fast paced medical environment. Working closely with medical professionals gave me the confidence to form and convey independent thoughts while not being afraid to ask questions and advice., Shadowing Experiences I do not like to make uninformed decisions so I found it prudent to shadow many different types of physicians upon deciding to make a career in medicine. In undergrad, I was able to participate in a minority shadowing program through the U.C. College of Medicine and was paired with a trauma surgeon over the course of a few months. In the following years I shadowed in infectious disease, human genetics, pediatric surgery and family practice. Though all of these experiences covered different fields, the one aspect that I took from each was the importance of good bedside manner and the social skills involved in managing patient diversity., Natural History and Science Museum Programming Specialist I have been involved with the Museum of Natural History and Science (MNHS) since I was 12 years old. I began in the youth program as a science interpreter, continued as an exhibit programming specialist throughout college, and now serve as a volunteer. At the museum I focused on writing and teaching biology demonstrations to the public and other staff. When I was young, the museum served as a retreat for me, cultivated my curiosity for science, and provided me the means to explore my future dreams. To return my appreciation, one of my subsequent initiatives has been to increase minority youth interest in the sciences while also maintaining an active mentoring relationship with each student., Teaching Assistant I served as a TA for Anatomy and Physiology lab in the advanced nursing program as well as the required freshmen class, College Success Skills (CSS). As a TA, I was able to leverage my experiences from working while in school and being a first generation college student to relate to current students. For A&P I helped nursing students with lab skills and practicals. I also worked with my students to help them learn skills in time management, organization, and work-life balance.  The CSS program resonated with me because I believe that I benefited greatly from taking it as a freshman and I wanted to share my experience and knowledge with other students in need., Human Subjects Protection Conference Attendee I will be attending my 4th annual Human Subjects Protection Conference in October. The purpose of these conferences is to provide information to researchers about historical and current issues regarding the protection of human subjects. Topics range from current FDA policies and procedures to recommendations on how to recruit minority patients and returning genetic results. This conference has proven to be a great forum for networking with clinical researchers from other institutions to learn more about the studies and systems that they employ. I enjoy attending these events to continue my growth in the field of clinical research and foster an attitude of life-long learning., Science Olympiad Regional Event Supervisor Science Olympiad is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of K-12 science education, increasing interest in science, creating a technologically-literate workforce and providing recognition for outstanding achievement. This mission is met by organizing more than 6,000 teams into regional and national-level science tournaments. I participated as a junior-high and high-school student and found it to be one of the most influential organizations for me in developing my love of science. For the past 4 years, I have volunteered as an event coordinator for events ranging from genetics to cell biology in hopes of bringing that same passion to this generation of students., Project Manager for Family Health Coaching Program Seven Hills Neighborhood Houses is a non-profit community center located in the urban core of Cincinnati. It serves as a refuge for children, youth, and families who reside in the surrounding neighborhood by providing youth, victims of crime, senior citizen, and school-based programs. One aspect that the center is currently missing is health care. My involvement with the center began one year ago as I mediated the partnership with CCHMC and 7 Hills to begin a community-based participatory research relationship with them and their residents. After writing a proposal to our hospital's Community Engagement Department, we were awarded a $25,000 gift to bring health care programs to the center., Clinical Research Professionals (CRP) Leadership Team The CRP group supports innovation and quality research by facilitating knowledge exchange and standardization of best practices. By serving on the membership committee, I have helped provide leadership and direction for the group. We focus on increasing the visibility of CRPs throughout the hospital and providing new opportunities to create a collaborative environment. The CRP group serves as a tool for continuing education and personal development. Joining this group has allowed me to supplement my own career development and I've had the added benefit of witnessing some of my ideas coming to fruition, such as training researchers in phlebotomy, allowing us to function more independently., Co-Founder of Minority Association of Pre-Medical Students The mission of MAPS is to guide minority pre-medical students and gain insight into health careers by coordinating informational programs, providing academic resources, and organizing volunteer opportunities. During my junior year of college, I helped to co-found and become president of the U.C. chapter of MAPS. We worked alongside the U.C. College of Medicine to set up a minority mentoring program with current medical students, implement a shadowing program, arranged free MCAT review workshops, and held weekly study sessions in order to form a strong support system amongst our members. In medical school I would like continue my commitment to this endeavor through joining a SNMA chapter., Lab Assistant Throughout my undergraduate career, I assisted graduate students and faculty at the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.C. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering with their research projects. Doing experiments in waste-water treatment and looking at different pollutants, I was able to see how environmental exposures can affect public health. This experience also helped me to apply the techniques I learned in my science classes and increase my proficiency in laboratory best practices., Mayor Mallory's Young Professional's Kitchen Cabinet (YPKC) YPKC's mission is to partner with the mayor's office to execute initiatives and recommend policies designed to attract and retain young professionals to Cincinnati. The cabinet is composed of 7 committees covering issues such as transportation, entertainment, and public health. As a member of the health and environment committee I focus on supporting health-themed events, encouraging urban agriculture, and assisting with the city's bar and restaurant recycling program. My involvement in YPKC has proven to be beneficial for networking, getting exposure to health policy, and being a public servant to the city in which I live."

    "text": "I was 24 years old when I decided to go back to school. It was obvious to me that working just to pay the bills was never going to make me happy. I knew that I needed a career; something that was meaningful and worth devoting my life to.  A key figure in this decision to become a doctor is my grandfather, himself a physician. Although he passed away before I was born, I have always greatly admired him. Growing up, my father would tell me stories about my grandfather's life and the type of man he was. I was told of how he had worked himself through medical school during the depression, and that he was a true old-fashioned doctor who carried a black bag and made house calls. He would perform surgeries in his own office at home, with only my grandmother, who he had trained himself, assisting. My grandfather treated generations of families in Bettesville, Ohio where he practiced. When his patients could not afford to pay anything, my father said it was not uncommon for him to receive livestock, or something else in return. My grandfather was a hardworking, compassionate, and generous man, the same type of man that I aspire to be.   There are a lot of people in this country and others that lack the type of care that should be available to all of us. Because of this, I am inspired by organizations that provide emergency aid and healthcare to those in need all over the world. Becoming involved in efforts like these is something I am dedicated to once I become a doctor. Ideally I would like to someday work for the World Health Organization, but I will go where ever I am needed.  Also contributing to my choice to study medicine is my longstanding interest in fitness and nutrition.  I have always read books and articles about the newest health trends, whether it was about newly studied nutrients, exercising more effectively, or just living healthier in general. I believe biology and medicine are a progression of these interests. I have grown increasingly interested in the workings of the human body and in cutting edge science, especially as I progressively understand them in more detail. When combined with my own natural urge to be useful and to help others, medicine seems like the perfect fit for me.   Since applying to medical school last year, I have had the opportunity to take some classes that have had a significant impact on my views. One of them, International Health, focused on healthcare in the developing world. The professor placed a great deal of emphasis on prevention, which made a lot of sense to me. The course has made me much more aware of the shocking conditions that exist elsewhere in the world; further strengthening my convictions about working in locations that have difficulty attracting physicians and  about giving back to the less fortunate, which are at the core of my passion to become a doctor.  My decision to become a doctor has filled me with a sense of excitement and purpose. Although not being accepted last year left me very disappointed, it did not quell the zeal I have to become a physician. I have pushed forward even harder, working to make myself a better and more informed medical student. research poster and presentation As a participant in the Biology Honors Program I am doing a research project, and will create a poster and present my research at the end of the Spring semester., Stein Hospice Care Center Volunteer As a Stein Hospice care center volunteer I had many duties, these included: front desk,  answering the phone and directing visitors; delivering patient food trays and helping feed those that needed it; preparing a luncheon for patient guests; helping the nurses with whatever they needed, such as moving patients and fetching things; comforting patients and family by talking with them or just sitting with them; taking Stein patients located at the Ohio Veterans Home for walks outside in their wheelchairs; and I also did some handy work assembling shelves and moving supplies as they were opening a new wing while I was there. I found the work very rewarding, especially when I made a connection with a patient and I knew that they were happy that I was there to keep them company., Green Family Pre-Medical Scholarship Given to one junior/senior  per year who is applying to medical school., Dean's University Scholarship I received this award given to students who begin at Firelands and then finish their degree at Main Campus. Several of my professors recommended me for it and it meant alot to me for them to do so., Organic Chemistry Mentor I tutored a small group of students in organic chemistry for the university. It was rewarding to help others accomplish their goals, and it also helped me understand the material better., Genetics Mentor I tutored a student in Genetics for the University. I enjoyed helping other students to understand their course material, and found that in teaching something I had to understand it even better than I had when I myself took the course., Biology Research My research is focused on a protein system found in some gram negative bacteria that enables energy transduction between the inner and outer membranes. My research specifically examines its role in antibiotic resistance."

    "text": "Until now I had never really questioned why I wanted to go to medical school; it was just always a part of the plan. It was seemingly inevitable, as if I were a cell whose differentiation was coded to yield medical school. The more I questioned my motives, the more frustrated I became. Finally, after months of reflection it dawned on me: there had to have been a trigger factor that began my differentiation down the path of a medical student. I started to think of my experiences in hospitals and one particular part of my personal history sparked the excitement and anticipation that I have always felt when thinking of my future as a physician. I am proud to trace my roots of my inspiration back to my parents.      My mother and father work in the medical field as registered nurses. They are extremely devoted parents who did not believe in baby sitters, sacrificing their time together for the sake of a better relationship with their children. My mother, consequently, worked third shift Friday through Sunday and my father worked afternoons during the week. There was an overlap between my father's shift and my mother's on Friday nights. Thus to accommodate, my mother would bring my sister and I to the hospital and my father would pick us up about an hour later. One day when coming into the hospital a short brunette approached my mother. Ordinarily she would probably not have caught my attention, but the look on her face captivated me. It was a look of complete gratitude; she took my mother's hand, held it in both of hers, and sincerely expressed her thanks. She thanked her for taking such good care of her husband, who I would later in life learn was a patient in my mother's rehabilitation unit. The woman walked away to rejoin her husband who was sitting in a wheelchair. In unison they waved to my mother knowing they would never forget her, their angel in a white coat. From that day on, I knew that I wanted to be able to help other people in the way that my parents do everyday. They work taxingly, most always without the appreciation and gratification that they deserve, but acknowledge that their work has a larger purpose, that they are making a difference. It was there in the lobby of Henry Ford Hospital, ironically my actual birthplace, that I realized the true meaning of a job in the medical field, and I could not wait to be apart of it.       Immediately, I became fascinated with school. I took up a strong interest in the sciences and math through high school, graduating with high honors. The Ohio State University offered me several academic scholarships, which I accepted. There, my love for science continued to grow, yet I began to ponder whether my appreciation for science was guiding me towards a medical profession. This curiosity directed me into the Medical Technology Science Track program. The curriculum of hematology, bacteriology, toxicology, and immunology provided me with the comfort that the medical field was right for me. I devoured the information in these classes knowing that one day it will assist me in helping another individual. I have attended the seminars that The Ohio State Medical Center frequently offers and also participated in dissections and autopsies in the morgue on my personal time. This motivation can be accredited to my growing love for simply being in the hospital and feeling like I am part of it all.       After becoming a part of the medical community I have come to relish the fast pace changes that technology and new breakthroughs are providing to the medical field. The atmosphere has only strengthened my determination to pursue an education and become a physician. However, I am not satisfied with only feeling as if I am part of the medical society; I need to officially be in it. That being said I now find myself at the next step in my life pursuit; becoming a medical student. Excellence Scholarship Award amount increased each year to compensate for increased tuition.

    "text": "It was a hot, sunny summer afternoon when I first walked into the Hopple Street Clinic. Brightly painted walls greeted me as I made my way to the nurse's station to meet the pediatrician I would spend my summer shadowing. In those months, I saw healthy children, sick children, and most memorably, poor children. Failure to thrive, lead poisoning, injuries from improper safety measures - it had never occured to me that these problems were plaguing families in my own hometown. The staff went to great lengths to provide what they could for these families: car seats and bicycle helmets, an air-conditioned place to sit, or lunch for children whose dinners might be uncertain. This was my first face-to-face experience with the struggles of the urban poor and the important role the medical community can play in improving the quality of a person's life. That summer affected me strongly, and I began to see that medicine could be the fulfilling and multi-faceted vocation I sought.  The search for a career that could extend into my personal life began with my family. My family has been a source of unfailing support and inspiration throughout my life. My parents, a teacher and a computer technician, made homework our after-school priority and reading the free-time activity of choice in our home. We spent dinnertime talking about geography and history, and I learned early to ask questions. Not knowing an answer was fine, but the next step was to look it up. An especially important person in my life was my grandfather. Poppy, as we called him, was a World War II veteran and a physician. He was a man of great integrity, and was known in his community, not only for being a doctor, but more importantly, for being a generous and kind community member. I have met many of his former patients, and the most commonly told stories about my grandfather are about what a good listener he was, or how he treated them even though he knew that they could not pay. I appreciate that he did not push a path on me, but made his passion an integral part of his everyday life and showed me what doctoring meant to him. Poppy never told me what I had to love, only that I had to love something. Poppy never told me that I should be a doctor; he only told me he was proud of me. My Poppy died last year, at the age of ninety-four, six months before I graduated from college. Though I am deeply saddened to lose him, his life is a source of inspiration and I am grateful for the chance to share in his career path. I hope that I can be not only as successful and beloved a physician as he was, but also a person with his strength of character.  As I came to the realization that I wanted to pursue a career in medicine, I sought out connections to the medical field, and after several shadowing experiences, I had the opportunity to spend my senior year working on a clinical research project tracking patient data to study acute kidney injury at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The project involved a wide variety of people from the hospital and I was able to get a taste of clinical research, see how many different departments can cooperate in a large study, and have an introduction to the publication process. I enjoy the focus on patient data for research and the subsequent closer connection to patients, even if I only get part of their story as I review their chart. Wanting to stay involved with clinical research, I recently started as a research assistant in the Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) Center at Children's Hospital. EB is a rare genetic disorder and in addition to my responsibilities in chart review, data entry, and obtaining consent to participate from potential subjects, there is a lot to learn. The work is interesting and enjoyable, and I look forward to the learning and the challenges I will face in this position.  Outside of my research job, I also volunteer for the Ronald McDonald House of Cincinnati, helping to create a home away from home for the families of hospitalized children. So many times, medicine seems like a Cause with a capital C, especially with all the politics whirling around healthcare recently. It is good to see and remember that people experience the illness we read about, and to be a friend in a difficult time. Volunteering at Ronald McDonald House is not so much about social justice or human rights on a large scale, but it is about respect, dignity, and solidarity. Standing with someone who is struggling and experiencing the triumphs and tragedies of life with chronic illness puts my ambitions into perspective. Even though universal treatments of healthcare issues are deeply important, personal experience and compassion are equally important in providing quality care.  The personal connection of direct contact with patients draws me to a career as a physician. Medicine, especially pediatrics, interests me because I want to be a part of a field that is constantly challenging not only my knowledge, but also my creativity, critical thinking, and compassion. Glimpsing a little part of the clinical research and family perspectives of medicine has solidified my desire to be a physician and put my talents and passions to work doing what I can to improve my corner of the world, just as my grandfather taught me. Research Assistant - Acute Kidney Injury As a research assistant for the Division of Nephrology, I worked on a research project investigating the rate of nephrotoxic medication induced acute kidney injury in the non-critically ill inpatient population of Cincinnati Children's Hospital, which we suspected had been underestimated. I worked to establish a process and metrics for data collection, created spreadsheets, and compiled the appropriate data through chart review. The resulting academic paper, of which I am a co-author, has recently been submitted to medical journals for peer review., Campus Ministry As an active participant in the religious life of my Catholic university, I was part of several activities within the campus ministry program. I acted as mentor to first-year students, helped organize and run retreats, and served as the secretary for the Catholic Identity group. Catholic Identity is student-led group that seeks to provide the optimal faith environment for the Catholic community on campus by emphasizing Catholic and Jesuit values while maintaining open relations with other faith groups., University Scholars Honors Program Based on the strength of my high school academic record, I was invited to join the University Scholars Honors Program at Xavier University. The program allows motivated students to take more challenging and in-depth courses in Xavier's liberal arts core curriculum. The honors program strengthens the core curriculum, encouraging an interdisciplinary approach to education rather than simply requiring more work. I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to take classes outside of my major and I believe that my ability to think critically, creatively, and globally both in academic assignments and in real-world situations was enhanced along the way.,  Cashiering,  Clinical Research, Cashier - Walmart Supercenter Employed as a Cashier at Walmart Supercenter #3656, I worked up to 40 hours per week during the summer of 2010, 4 hours per week during the school year, 30 hours per week during holidays, and 20 hours per week in the summer of 2011. I was recognized for composure in stressful situations, friendliness with customers and co-workers, and expertise on difficult transaction types. Walmart shoppers are from many different races, socioeconomic classes and temperaments, and cashiering gave me a new perspective on people from many different backgrounds. Much more than to my bank account, my job at Walmart contributed to my social sensitivity, my sense of humility, and my patience., Research Assistant - Epidermolysis Bullosa Center Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare genetic skin disorder in which the proteins in the skin do not correctly anchor the epidermis to the dermis, causing blistering with small amounts of mechanical friction. I work as a research assistant on the human subjects clinical research studies being conducted by the EB Center. My primary duties include chart review, data entry, and obtaining consent from parents and children who are eligible to enroll in our studies. I work with Excel spreadsheets, Access and RedCap databases, electronic and paper medical records, and IRB documentation on a regular basis., Xavier University Pep Band I played flute and piccolo for the Xavier University Pep Band beginning in January of my freshman year and continuing through to my graduation. I traveled with the band to nearly every tournament that the men's and women's basketball teams attended in that time frame, including three men's Sweet 16 appearances, a women's Elite 8 appearance, and yearly men's and women's Atlantic 10 conference tournament appearances. We traveled around the United States on these trips, including stays in Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Boston, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. I was elected as Vice President of the student-run board for my senior year and helped plan the trips, organize events, and connect with alumni., St. Francis Xavier Academic Scholarship I was awarded the St. Francis Xavier full-tuition, merit-based scholarship as an incoming first-year student. The scholarship is awarded to ten first-year students annually based on academic achievement and leadership involvement. Typically awarded to students in the top five percent of their graduating class, the scholarship is renewable for four years with continued academic excellence. I received the scholarship for all eight semesters of my undergraduate career., Alpha Epsilon Delta Honor Society I was inducted into the Ohio Kappa Chapter of the Alpha Epsilon Delta honor society on April 18, 2010 and elected Secretary for the 2010-2011 school year. I was elected Vice President for 2011-2012 school year and helped organize and plan meetings for the Executive Board and General Body, as well as events held by the society. In 2010-2011 we raised funds for Project Orphan Smiles, a local group of advocates for orphans in developing countries, and hosted speakers. In 2011-2012, AED held a hygiene drive, during which we collected donations to provide the homeless of Cincinnati with basic hygiene products, hosted speakers, and presented a panel about healthcare career paths., Dean's List I was named to the Dean's List in the Fall 2008, Spring 2009, Fall 2010, Spring 2011, Fall 2011, and Spring 2012, and subsequently graduated cum laude., Teaching Assistant/Laboratory Instructor I worked for one summer as the teaching assistant and laboratory instructor for an introductory, non-major chemistry course known at the time as Chemistry in Society. The course taught adult part-time students basic chemical principles by focusing on chemistry's impact on society and the planet. I prepared and presented pre-lab lectures, monitored laboratory exercises, and graded lab reports, in addition to answering questions and holding review sessions for both lecture and lab tests., Undergraduate Research My undergraduate research project in the Department of Chemistry, culminating with the submission of my senior thesis, sought to develop a method for maximizing assays for UV-Vis spectrophotometric rate detection, focusing on the inhbition of the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase with trans-resveratrol, a polyphenol notably found in red wine. As the only student working on the project this past academic year, I was responsible for all experimental work done in the laboratory, from solution preparation to spectra analysis., Guest Services Volunteer - Ronald McDonald House Cincinnati Ronald McDonald House Charities of Greater Cincinnati works to provide a home away from home for families of hospitalized children at one of the local hospitals, most notably at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The Cincinnati House is one of the largest in the world, and is full nearly every day of the year. To keep the House running smoothly, Ronald McDonald House Charities relies on a large group of volunteers. I work at the front desk, providing information, helping with administrative tasks, and interacting with the families staying in the house., Summer Shadowing Program The summer prior to starting college, I was selected to participate in a summer internship for college-bound pre-medicine students at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center with the Division of General and Community Pediatrics. I spent my summer shadowing several different pediatricians in the Cincinnati area, covering many aspects of pediatric care. Most of my time was spent at Hopple Street Clinic, an urban outpatient clinic serving mainly impoverished families. I also shadowed on inpatient hospital floors, in a suburban private practice, and in a rural clinic operated by Children's Hospital, as well as helped convert paper charts to electronic medical records., Volunteer Work Throughout college, I volunteered at several different sites, both for one-time events and in more long-term capacities. The three most notable long-term volunteer experiences have been my involvement in Xavier University's Students Taking Active Roles group as a tutor at an after school homework club for elementary school students; in the Interfaith Hospitality Network hosting homeless families at my parish; and in the music ministry of a neighboring parish. The contact information for Students Taking Active Roles is listed above. My contacts at my parish are Steve and Laura Wolke (513-825-8626), and with music ministry is Gene Meister (513-410-0896)."

    "text": "I have selected the field of medicine as a career choice because I would like to make a positive difference in people's lives and I find medicine and human physiology absolutely fascinating.  Since I was a child, my parents, especially my mother, have shown me the importance of having compassion for others, and I believe I can bring that compassion into the medical profession.    Ever since I was in elementary school, I have loved science.  I especially enjoyed the life sciences, and at one point considered being a marine biologist.  I found the variety of marine life extremely interesting.  I became intrigued by the amount of research relating to marine animals and medicine.  I was fascinated by the concept of purifying different toxins from marine life, which normally would be deadly in their raw states, for use as revolutionary pain killers. The fact that sharks do not get cancer, and that research is being done to figure out why, also caught my interest.  It was during high school that I realized that the medical aspect of science was what interested me the most, and that I wanted to become a doctor.  At about the same time, my younger sister began having problems with her thyroid.  When she was diagnosed with Grave's Disease, my mother appointed me to do some online research on the disease and possible treatments to supplement the information that the doctor had given us.  Learning about Grave's Disease, its diagnosis, and the treatments available deepened my desire to get into the medical profession.  It was also then that I believe I solidified my intentions to be a pediatrician.  I have worked with children before through my volunteer work at my church and assistant teaching at my dance school, and have enjoyed it.  I am still trying to decide if I want to be a general pediatrician or if I want to specialize in pediatric oncology.    What motivates me to learn more about medicine is my experience with diseases through my family.  As I have mentioned before, my sister's illness helped motivate me in pursuing a career in medicine.  My strongest motivation, however, comes from my grandmother.  My grandmother was a Type II diabetic with hypertension, high cholesterol, and a history of having small strokes.  At one point, she was taking over 25 pills a day.  When she started becoming a little absent-minded, we first thought that it was just part of the natural aging process.  Then when she started to forget about leaving the stove on, we became worried and contacted her doctor.  Soon afterwards, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  The first couple years were not so bad. Though she could not live alone anymore, she still remembered our family and only needed constant reminders of events and other little things.  As the disease progressed, however, she constantly mixed up who we were, confusing my dad with his deceased father.  She began to forget that my siblings and I were not very small children anymore and therefore did not recognize us.  As her condition worsened, her personality changed radically, and she would become agitated very easily.  Towards the end she would not even talk anymore and would just stare blankly into space.  The hardest thing of my life was sitting there, watching the person that my grandmother was slowly die while her body kept living, and not being able to do a thing about it.  Her physical body was still there, but the grandmother I had grown up with and have so many memories of was lost forever.  From this, I know now what it is like to slowly watch someone you love die.  It is the worst experience imaginable.  This experience motivates me to learn more about medicine so that I can help do everything in my power so that others do not have to experience a similar loss with their grandparent, parent, spouse, or child; and when it is out of my power to prevent such a loss, my experience will help me to help them cope.   My strong desire to excel in pursuits that are important to me also motivates me to learn more about medicine.  Getting into the medical field is a pursuit that is very important for me.  I have worked hard to excel in all my undergraduate courses with the goal of entering medical school in mind.  I feel that when you do something, no matter what it is, you should do it to the best of your ability; otherwise you are cheating yourself, never fully realizing you true potential.  I apply this attitude to my academics as well as my job in a biochemistry research lab.  So far this attitude has helped me succeed in my coursework and in the research I help with in the lab: I have maintained a high GPA and am expecting to help submit a paper on one of the research projects I am involved in for publication in a scientific journal.  I will apply this same dedication to excel to medical school and the medical profession. DEV 095 Proctor As a DEV 095 Proctor, I was responsible for making sure my groups of students understood remdial algebra concepts through explanation, assigning and grading homework, and preparing the students for their exams.  I also worked in the programs Help Room, in which I assisted students who were having difficulty understanding algebra.  DEV 095 is a pass/fail class that the students register for if their math enterance exam indicates they need remediation., Undergraduate Lab Assistant As an Undergraduate Lab Assistant, I wash dishes, stock supplies, autoclave items that need to be sterilized, and other activities that help maintain the lab.  I also assist the masters students and the post doctorate student with their experiments by labeling test tubes, preforming quantitative analysis of their samples, harvesting cells, pouring and running gels for resolving proteins, and maxi prepping plasmid DNA, among others.  I have also preformed immunofluorescent assays.  I have been working on a Phage Display project that is nearing completion.  Once this project is complete, I will help write the paper on it so it can be submitted to a scientific journal.  A second project that I have been assigned to that our lab is also hoping to publish is an experiment studying the effects of different proteins on p63, which is a protein that is involved in development and cancer regulation., Wright State Pre-Med Society Member At Wright State Pre-Med Society meetings, guest speakers from various medical professions came to talk about their jobs.  Tips on preparing for medical school were also given., Preschool Sunday School Assistant Every other Sunday, I volunteer in the preschool Sunday School class.  I am in charge of craft time, helping the children make their crafts, providing them with a snack, and cleaning up afterwards.  I also help lead the songs and watch the children during playtime., Dean's List I have been on the Dean's List every quarter that I was registered full-time for since Fall Quarter 2004., Dance I have studied ballet, tap, jazz, and lyrical/modern dance styles at Jeanette Popp School of Dance.  Every year in late May or early June, the school produces its annual dance recital, in which I have performed.  Last year, I also was a substitute ballet teacher at Jeanette Popp School of Dance.  This year is my eleventh year at Jeanette Popp School of Dance., Ballroom Dance I recently started taking ballroom lessons, which include the tango, cha-cha, waltz, and mambo.  I was asked to be a part of the Ladies Formation for Always Ballroom at the Dancetonians 35th Annual Dance Fair on May 12, 2007, and accepted.  I hope to one day be able to compete in amature ballroom dance competitions., NSCS Member NSCS is an honor society for college students exhibiting qualities in academics, service, and leadership.  Membership is invitation only based upon GPA and class standing., Asian Student Association Member The Asian Student Association is open to everyone and provides opportunities for experiencing different aspects of Asian culture, such as sampling authentic Asian restaurants., GBU National Conference The GBU is a German fraternal organization of which I am a member.  I was invited by the head of our chapter to attend the national conference since I was one of their scholarship recipients.  At the conference, I was able to witness some of the meetings and the election of the national board members. It also provided an opportunity to see what volunteer work other chapters were doing, as well as show the other chapters the volunteer work that our chapter was doing, such as the canned food drive we have each year around Christmas."

    "text": "Its one of those cold winter mornings in Cleveland, Ohio; its Saturday, the Sun has not even pierced the skys horizon, and none of my roommates are quite up yet.  My clocks alarm starts blaring as my eyes start to open slowly to check the time.  Its an hour until I usually volunteer at Rainbow Babies.  I slowly get up, take a shower, eat a quick breakfast, and rush to my destination. As I walk to the hospital, I can feel the wind blowing right in face while my lips are trembling. This is one of those moments that I just can't help but to ask myself: Is this what Im really meant to be doing  Determined, however, I head straight to the fifth floor of the University Hospital to open the volunteer activity center. Its early, so I start making my way around to patient rooms to see if I can help in any way. Many patients come and go but there are few there with conditions such as cystic fibrosis that need to stay at the hospital long term. One such patient, well call him Zach (to maintain confidentiality), has been there as long as I can remember. He is a pool shark, an avid Dragon Ball (anime) fan, and enjoys many activities I loved doing as a kid. Whatever we did I always ended up enjoying it as much as he did. Although I can only be there a few hours a week, I know that I brought him many laughs and smiles. Being a doctor is not only about making people smile but also about saving their lives and greatly improving their quality of life.  I want to become a doctor to help people out and have realized that the road to becoming a doctor is bittersweet, full of many obstacles as rough as Clevelands winter morning.   \tFor me, the desire to pursue a career in medicine did not just spring up overnight; rather, it happened over time. During my freshman year in high school I vividly remember my parents bringing up how I was born with a condition called hydrocele, which is easily fixable with surgery. But for my parents in graduate school, a surgery was out of reach for their income. However, a surgeon at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital performed the surgery free of charge. When I heard this I felt deeply touched and decided to contribute my own time to give back to those in need. Throughout high school and college, I have volunteered at various hospitals; as a result, I have seen plenty of kids being helped with all kind of treatments. One incident that struck me most was a little girl from China who was born with her bladder outside of her body. She needed constant parental care to avoid infections. From the few days I worked with her, I learned what she wished for most was to walk without assistance and to play outside just like other normal kids. Fortunately, she was successfully treated at Childrens Hospital and went back to China. Through this encounter and my own experience, I know that there are plenty of kids like this girl and I who need help. As a volunteer I could do little more than bring a smile to the childrens face through playing with them. However, my time with them made it clear to me that by becoming a physician I could help patients lead a normal and more fulfilling life. \tMy interest in medicine was solidified by doctor shadowing experiences presented through the University Of Cincinnati College Of Medicines ROSE Program and HCARE Program. My deepest experience to memory was shadowing a trauma surgeon for a week when I was a HCARE participant. Every day we would make rounds through his patients, many of whom lived in the inner city. One particular patient was stabbed through gang violence, and this was the third times for him in the past two years. The surgeon straight out told him that if he continued what he was doing, he would not live for another two year. Upon leaving the room, the surgeon told me that most of his patients probably would not listen and would be in this ward several more times. He continued by saying that sometimes you just have to tell those patients the hard truth even if its the last thing they want to hear, and his job is the preservation of life under all circumstances.  This experience helped me form in my mind more of what a doctor needs to do and made me want to pursue a medical career.  \tI want to help patients cope with whatever condition they have both physiologically and mentally. My experiences with volunteering and shadowing have taught me the need for compassion, empathy, and commitment.  My dedication, passion, and motivation will aid me tirelessly in helping those in need.  Through medical school I hope not only to learn more academically but also to learn more of what its truly like to be a doctor. Tau Beta Pi: Technology Chair After my induction into Tau Beta Pi honor society, I was elected as the Technology Chair for the 2012-2013 school year. As the Technology Chair, I was responsible for keeping the Bookswap database up to date, keeping the membership database running, and contributed my time and effort organizing some of the activities., Biomedical Engineering Honors Society: Alpha Eta Mu Beta Alpha Eta Mu Beta is the National Biomedical Engineering Honor Society that extends membership to BME students who are top 1/5 of their class (junior) or top 1/3 of their class (senior). The purpose of AEMB is to provide outreach to the community to increase general interest in both science and engineering. I’ve advised some underclassmen BME students who have had questions about their BME path and class scheduling., Dean’s High Honor List + Dean’s List Dean’s high honor list is conferred to students who have acquired a GPA of 3.750 or greater during a given semester. Dean’s honor list is conferred to students who have acquired a GPA of 3.500 or greater during a given semester. I’ve been on Dean’s High Honor List or Dean’s Honor List every given semester at Case Western Reserve University., Research through Rose Program I am a ROSE Program fellow at UCCOM. For 8 weeks during my sophomore year summer and 10 weeks during my junior year summer I worked at the Cancer Biology research lab of UCCOM. My lab previously found that certain strains of MEF were more sensitive to ionizing gamma radiation. Comet assay was used to evaluate the degree of DNA damage cells sustained and then correlate them to their DNA repair ability. Most of my work revolved around developing a protocol of comet assay for my lab to evaluate the double strand break repair ability of normal cells versus mutant cells. I also contributed to other projects in the same laboratory and did Western Blots and PCR for other lab projects., Doctor Shadowing I have been shadowing various doctors since high school. I have shadowed cardiologists, surgeons, neurologists, anesthesiologists, pediatricians, internists, and radiologists. Following them through their daily operations and rounds, I learned about what kinds of issues they had to deal with along with how they approached and resolved them. Being exposed to a variety of doctors, I was able to see the stark difference in the daily interactions and challenges each kind of doctor had to face. Following these doctors gave me more of a sense of what path of medicine I want to go into in the future., Volunteering at University Hospitals (Rainbow Babies) I have volunteered for the past two years during the school year at the UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital at Case Western Reserve University. On Saturday or Sunday morning I volunteer at Rainbow 5 and work with children who have respiratory issues for three or more hours. I help manage the activity center where patients can come in to play or check out board games. I also visit patients who cannot come to the activity room due to their medical conditions and entertain them., Research at Metabolic Diseases Institute My research involved the study of the effects Apo AIV/CCK on the suppression of hunger/body weight and the study of c-Fos positive proteins in the hindbrain and hypothalamus on food intake. I spent much time doing chemical assays to determine concentrations of proteins, triglycerides, and lipids in different genotype rats. I also did extensive brain sectioning and fixation on slides. I learned immunohistochemistry and acquired numerous techniques that prepared me for future research., Drug Delivery Research at Case Western Reserve University My work was to study the effectiveness of using EHCO and ECO as carriers to deliver therapeutic siRNA to cancer cells. I did flow cytometry to identify what proportion of U87 (brain cancer cells) took up the EHCO and ECO carrying the therapeutic siRNA through identifying fluorescent U87 cell population. I worked on changing N/P (amines:phosphate ratio present in the siRNA) and seeing how different ratios resulted in different amount of cellular uptake for the siRNA drug., Honors Fraternity: Tau Beta Pi Tau Beta Pi is the oldest engineering honor society that offers membership to engineers who rank in the top 1/8 of their class (juniors) or top 1/5 of their class (seniors); I was officially inducted in sophomore years because I have both accumulated enough academic credit to qualify as a junior. The purpose of the organization is to foster interest in engineering through programs targeted towards k-12 students as well as general outreach into the community. I have participated in the annual Bookswap to help students sell their old textbooks to other students, the Core Cram, where members tutor underclassmen in core engineering classes before their semester finals, and other activities."

    "text": "Personal Statement for Brennan M. Lawall       I have been fortunate to be able to experience opportunities that reinforce my dream to be a doctor. The last two years of high school started me down the path that I am now on. I decided to take an Anatomy and Physiology course and absolutely loved it. No other course in high school excited me as much. My first inclination to go into medicine can be drawn from there. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend a cadaver lab at the University of Cincinnati while still in high school. My heart was racing with excitement the entire time.       These early indications led me to take pre-medical coursework at the University of Dayton. I successfully navigated my way through each course gaining confidence in myself with every passing grade. Also while at the University of Dayton, I have volunteered at Dayton Children's Medical Center. Once a week, I visit with the patients. When looking into the patient's eyes, I want to be able to help them in ways that I cannot already do. I can make them laugh, can make them happy, and I can give them a friend but I cannot find what pains them and be able to fix it. I can earn their trust, but do not have the knowledge to be able to definitively know how to help them other than the aforementioned ways. Laughter and happiness can improve their quality of life, but I cannot cure them of their disease. The staff at the hospital does a fine job and I would like to be a part of a staff like this. I believe by becoming a doctor that I can combine this compassion and knowledge to help future patients in every way. I am grateful to be with the patients every week and to get the possibility to see the world from their perspective. I believe that this will help me to better understand and connect with patients that I may have in the future.       The decision to apply for medical school has been a process rather than an instantaneous decision. I have been fortunate for the opportunities that have been presented to me. No member of my immediate and extended family has been a doctor. Not truly knowing what it would be like to be a doctor, I have worked to know this profession by shadowing multiple doctors and attending talks put on by the pre-health society that I am a part of, Alpha Epsilon Delta, at the University of Dayton. I have gotten to speak to many doctors and have asked them questions about their jobs and their personal lives as well. Every time, I walk away with a reinforced feeling that this is the career for me. I tackled the unknown of the medical world by using what I have learned from music and sports. I play a lot of sports, am learning to play the piano, and am learning how to Salsa dance. With each of these, failure is rampant. However, one must learn to work hard at it and continue to put in full effort in order to be good at these tasks. I use this hard-work and determination that I learn from these fun activities and have been applying it to my every day life. This helps in many aspects of my life. I am determined to become the best and most compassionate doctor that I can be. Tutoring in Science Subjects At the University of Dayton, I worked for the Tutoring services for one-on-one tutoring and for drop-in tutoring. Students came seeking help and I would tutor them in the science courses that I am qualified for., Spring Break Out to Honduras During the ten days of Spring Break for the 2008 Winter semester at the University of Dayton, I attended a Spring Break-Out to the country of Honduras. We affiliated our group with Shoulder to Shoulder and stayed at their medical clinic in Honduras. We helped coordinate and run a brigade for the children of surrounding areas. While on the brigade, I participated in drawing blood for hematocrit testing and checking vision. I also helped by taking vitals at the clinic., Salsa Dancing Club Member of the University of Dayton Salsa Dancing Club.

    "text": "Not everyone achieves rock star status in their lifetimes, but I have.  And it all started with some magic cards...  Four summers ago, I ascended to that rank in the eyes of the patients at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.  If their doctor was running late, I would enter the rooms instead and offer the cards as a sort of dual icebreaker/peace offering.  The responsibility of entertaining the families until the doctor arrived was not what I had anticipated shadowing a physician to mean, and this role initially even intimidated me.   That intimidation, however, lasted only until I was propelled into the first room.  At that moment, I experienced a sort of paradigm shift and everything that followed made me certain I was in the right place, doing exactly the right thing.  I cannot imagine how different that summer would have been if I had not been momentarily forced out my comfort zone and into that first room.   I would not have been able to truly get to know the families and listen to their inspiring stories.  I would not have experienced the joy and satisfaction that comes with meeting new people and serving them in an uplifting way.  I would not have made the decision to become a physician that summer, and I most certainly would not have risen to rock star status in the eyes of the children that received the three garbage bags full of my magic cards.     Two and a half years later in a clinic near Kisumu, Kenya, I was again struck with the feeling of being in the right place, doing the right thing.  Having traveled there as a team to provide healthcare in the area, we had planned to work only a few hours since we were running low on medications.  In no way were we prepared for the man running through the streets with a bullhorn announcing FREE AMERICAN MEDICAL CARE and in barely an hour we were almost out of what little supply we had.    At that moment, I was assisting with the intake of a twenty year old, HIV positive girl whose two children were positive as well.  She had tuberculosis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, and other fungal infections covering most of her body.  We had no medication to offer her, but I did happen to have a small amount of money.  It turned out to be enough to get her to a nearby clinic where she would be able to receive treatment for her secondary infections.  My feelings of inadequacy at being unable to help so many others were replaced at least momentarily by my thankfulness for having been in the right place to help her.  \t\t  That experience branched out in ways I never could have imagined.  After returning from my trip to Africa, I continued my interest in the field of international health and contacted Dr. Mario Grijalva, the director of our school's Tropical Disease Institute (TDI) in hopes of setting up a tutorial concerning the subject.  We began meeting weekly as I put together PowerPoint presentations on five diseases that posed a threat to millions of people worldwide.  I then had the opportunity to turn my presentations into a website in hopes of educating others on what I had learned (http://www.oucom.ohiou.edu/tdi/Topics_International_Health/index.htm).    It also turned out that Dr. Grijalva conducted research on Chagas' disease in Ecuador, mobilizing teams of American students and Ecuadorian Ministry of Health workers to visit rural communities in Ecuador.  In these communities, the teams search for the Triatomine vectors that transmit Trypanosoma cruzi. Educational talks on the dangers of the insects are also given to the families.  If insects are found at a home, it is sprayed with insecticide.  Furthermore, records are kept of each house in order to track its change in status over time.    This research fascinated me so much so that I ended up traveling to Ecuador for seven weeks to assist--with the data gathered during that time also serving as the basis for my senior thesis project: Patterns of Household Reinfestation by Triatomine Species in Loja Province of Southern Ecuador.   While there, Dr. Grijalva also arranged for all of the children in the communities we visited to be tested for Chagas'.  I was fortunate enough to spend a few days in these clinics as well.  Throughout my college career, my experiences constantly reaffirmed both my interest in international health and desire to become a physician.  I believe that all of my experiences are leading up to the next moment I will be sure I am again in the right place, doing the right thing--in medical school.  Nothing excites me more than the prospect of continuing my involvement in the study of tropical disease and international health--this time as a physician.  Writing this statement takes me back to how I felt right before I stepped into that first room at Children's.  Just as I was given the opportunity to make a positive impact that summer, I sincerely hope to be given the opportunity to take the next step towards my dream today.  And who knows, maybe one day I will even be a doctor with a magic-card-dispensing rock star of my own.

Dr. Grijalva, my senior thesis advisor, presented research based on the work we did in Ecuador (Tropical Disease Research, described below).  Dr. Kitron's research utilizing GIS as a means to study Chagas' in Argentina had a focus very similar to my senior thesis project (also described below).  I was even fortunate enough to have the opportunity to collaborate with some of his students after his presentation., National and International Travel My father grew up in Japan; ever since visiting there when I was three, I have had a passion for traveling.  So far I have made it to Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Kenya, Scotland, and Ecuador (in addition to Japan three times)., Swimming Swimming has always served as a source of stress relief and physical fitness for me.  I swam competitively throughout middle and high school, and I plan on joining a Masters team in the near future., Tropical Disease Research The burden of households with Triatomine insects (vector of Chagas' disease) has been shown to be quite high in Southern Ecuador.  This Tropical Disease Research (TDR) is a pilot control program aimed at reducing that burden.  It is funded in part by the World Health Organization.  I assisted with the following aspects of this research during the seven weeks that I spent in Ecuador: -Community mapping using GPS -Census of population and available infrastructure (electricity, health care, water, school, etc) -Administration of housing surveys -Subsequent database management -Intradomiciliary, peridomiciliary, and sylvatic insect searches -Educational booklet and calender distribution -Finger pricks of children in the communities in order to test them for Chagas', Senior Thesis Title: Patterns of Household Reinfestation by Triatomine Species in Loja Province of Southern Ecuador  Background:  There is currently no cure for Chagas' disease.  It is transmitted to humans via Triatomine insect vectors; as such, it is important to place an emphasis on control of the vectors.  However, these insects maintain complex life cycles that enable them to filter back into areas where they have been previously eradicated. Studies conducted on the patterns of such reinfestations allow for more focused control efforts and overall diminished numbers of the insects.  Methodologies:  I utilized the data gathered during my participation in the Tropical Disease Research as an input into a geographic information system (GIS).  This allowed me to analyze the patterns of reinfestion in a spatially-referenced way.  Hypotheses: The initial patterns of infestation and reinfestation will be different than patterns created by random events; a history of past infestation will correlate to future infestation.  Results: Only a few communities showed patterns of infestation/reinfestation that were significantly different than random.  I am currently working on completing my thesis and submitting a manuscript for publication."

    "text": "It is 1:04 am, and I am finally leaving a half-hour after my twelve-hour ER Technician shift was scheduled to end.  The three-day weekend has been unkind, and the waiting room is still full.  As I exit the ER, the same things usually cross my mind.  The first is the aching pain in my feet that remind me to buy more comfortable shoes.  The second is a sense of satisfaction in that pain; it means that I worked as hard as I could for my patients, just as I want to continue to do as a physician. I have never been afraid to work hard. I always assumed, however, that I would commit my efforts to science, not medicine. Many of the conversations with my dad, a physicist, focused on science and mathematics.  Family trips turned into physics lessons complete with free-body diagrams on restaurant napkins.  Though these impromptu lectures caused my mother terrible embarrassment, I happily inherited my dad's passion for science. When I entered college, I worked in a protein crystallography lab that was investigating the structure of a protein important in cancer.  Over the course of two years, none of the 9600 tests I set up yielded even a single crystal that would have been sufficient to get structural data. As is common in research, my project had failed. My hard work could not overcome an inherently soluble protein, something impossible to predict prior to starting the project. I was disappointed, and although I didn't get the results that I wanted, this experience provided some wisdom on the nature of research. Not every hypothesis will be correct, but it is important to utilize new information in the future. Armed with this insight, I used my past experiences in the lab to benefit my current work as a biochemistry master's student. I am studying TrkB, a receptor important in Alzheimer's disease. One lesson from my early struggles in the lab is that failures are also opportunities for innovation. When I had problems isolating TrkB, I saw it as a chance to try something different. I took a purification protocol from a large biotech company and adapted it to work with the basic equipment we had in our small lab. I went into research expecting that diligence would get me results, but instead it produced resourcefulness and ingenuity.  As much as I gained from the unexpected results at the lab bench, I found myself wanting more direct personal interaction.  This desire grew out of my involvement at the church I attended during college. In my junior year, I led a Bible study group. I was ready to do everything possible to serve the members. In that first year, there was no one in our group who could lead the music worship. Over the next two weeks, I practiced guitar desperately, learning two songs. With sore fingers and sour notes, I led the music worship during our first Bible study. This, however, was not the most difficult part of leading the Bible study group; in fact, this had been the easy part. The most challenging time was when people were struggling, and there was nothing I could do. When one of the younger members lost his father to cancer that year, it was agonizing to see him struggle with the pain. Despite all my willingness to work and do everything possible, the best I could offer was to simply be there as a friend. As much as I valued diligence, I saw that compassion and sympathy are just as important in caring for people. Eager to develop my passion for connecting with others, I took the initiative to volunteer at a children's hospital and community clinic. My interest in medicine grew, and I wanted to be a part of the patient care process. After receiving my EMT certification, I started as an ER Tech at a local hospital. Out of all that I saw in my time as an ER Tech, Greg is one person who sticks out the most in my mind. The growths on his ears that had been slowly bleeding over several days had forced him to visit the hospital. Avoiding Greg's strong smell and disheveled appearance, the nurses pushed off taking him as a patient. Here was someone whom I could have easily walked away from, knowing that a nurse would eventually assist him. But, similar to my time in the lab, I realized that the challenge of working with Greg was an opportunity for me to grow. I started the rigorous process of washing Greg's ears, carefully distinguishing between clot and flesh and removing the tangled masses in his long hair and beard. While I knew that I would not be able to stop the tumorous growths, I also knew that sometimes the compassion and presence of another person can be enough, as was the case for my friend from college.  I talked with Greg, occasionally asking questions, but it seemed that he had been just waiting to share his stories. After I bandaged his ears, he was admitted to see a specialist.  Hard work may not have cured a major disease or brought my friend's father back, but it provided lessons that prepare me for the challenges I will face in medicine. After three hours of meticulously cleaning that one patient, I did not feel the fatigue or bitterness I had expected. Instead, two things came to mind. The first was the fulfillment of practicing genuine care in medicine which strengthened my desire to serve people as a physician. The second was another reminder to get those comfortable shoes. Hospital Volunteer After moving back from Philadelphia, I was able to start volunteering at a hospital where my mother works as a registered nurse, and where I had volunteered at during high school. Although many of the people had changed, it was still a good experience to be working in the emergency room. There is a great deal of patient interaction as I was able to take patients from triage to their bed and even set up their monitor. It's fulfilling to be able to talk with patients and help them to ease into the very sterile hospital environment.  Working as a volunteer also gave me an opportunity to get to know the nurses and doctors, which eventually led me to an opportunity to shadow a physician. I learned a great deal about the roles of the doctors, nurses, and various techs that work in the department. As a volunteer, I have also gained experience, and have come to enjoy working in such a team oriented environment. This has led me to apply for an Emergency Room Tech position in this emergency room so I can take advantage of my EMT-Basic certification., Church Coordinator As a coordinator, I was part of organizing major events for our church such as the Mini-Olympics, an event where Bible study groups compete against one another in different physical activities to build relationships and unity within their groups. This required finding a field, organizing events, and finding people to act as referees and to run the games. Coordinators come up with ideas for events that would allow members to practice their faith, build relationships within the church, and provide opportunities for members of the church to serve. The coordinators also spend time praying for the congregation and church as a whole. Another responsibility I have is to reserve rooms for our church.  This is necessary because there was no separate building for this campus church and services are held in rooms on campus. This involves building good relationships with the school, planning services half a year in advance, and ensuring that each event is confirmed. The unpredictability of the reservation process has taught me flexibility and resourcefulness. Being a church coordinator was an ideal way for me to develop skills in leadership and planning., Hospital Volunteer As a volunteer I was responsible for creating a safe environment for children in the unfamiliar hospital setting.  Patients would often want to play games, watch movies, and even just sit and talk. It was rewarding to be with patients and serve some of their needs. It was also important for the children to feel as comfortable as possible in the potentially unfamiliar and uncomfortable hospital setting. In addition to playing and interacting with the patients, I would also spend time disinfecting toys that the patients play with to prevent nosocomial infection. Working with children and being able to see that there are needs of patients beyond what the doctors and nurses can provide was an enlightening experience.  I enjoyed being able to help children keep a positive attitude even during a tough time in a hospital., Missions Trip to Kenya For one month last summer, I was able to go on a mission trip with my church to Kenya. We saw much of the country including Nairobi, the Masailand, and also the mountain area of Kapsowar. At each location we spent time doing Gospel presentations in marketplaces and children's Bible school. We were able to visit houses, getting to know the nationals in a personal way. The trip allowed me to gain a broader cultural perspective as well as a stronger commitment to my faith. I particularly enjoyed the time we spent in Kapsowar. We stayed with a missionary doctor and his family. I saw the difference in healthcare in Kenya, especially in resources and infrastructure. In seeing what the missionary physician did on a day to day basis, I saw how health is focused on the individual as well as the community at large. He would see a many patients each day, and then also raise money for community needs such as a morgue and an extension for the records room. A new nursing school was also being constructed as a result of the money he had raised. This showed me that health is not limited to just physical needs, as the school effort was an attempt to empower nationals to be able to become self-sufficient by acquiring training., Church Bible Study Group Leader In a church with a large congregation, the smaller setting of the Bible study group provides a more comfortable environment that is less overwhelming and where members can build more intimate relationships and develop their beliefs.  My responsibilities as a leader included preparing Bible studies, leading short times of musical worship, and coordinating events, activities, and meetings for the group. I was also responsible for training and challenging other members to become leaders as well.  This was an experience I am grateful for because it taught me a great deal about leadership and how to invest into other people., Research Assistant My research involves finding the prevalence of the fluoroquinolone resistant gene, AAC6'-Ib-cr, in hospital patients at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.  Samples of Escherichia coli from patients are cultured and the DNA isolated.  After taking the isolated DNA, I amplify the DNA using PCR and use gel electrophoresis and sequencing to determine if the resistant gene is present. From the samples collected, approximately 13% of clinical isolates of E. coli taken from patients were resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, and contained the AAC6 gene.  This work in the hospital lab, although not directly with patients, has given me an opportunity to see the basic relationship between hospital practice and clinical research.  Being able to work in a clinical lab as opposed to a strictly biochemistry research lab has been rewarding because it is easier to see the link between research done in the lab and the application of that research in helping patients., Publication in the Proceedings of UKC2009 My research was accepted for publication in the proceedings of US-Korea Conference 2009, and I was also able to give an oral presentation at the conference. Although I was the youngest presenter, it was a good opportunity to network with other researchers in biochemistry, as well as those in closely related fields.  This is my first publication, and I look forward to being able to publish more work with my current master's thesis research., Masters Thesis Research My thesis project is the expression, purification, and NMR analysis of TrkBd5, a transmembrane receptor protein found on neurons that mediate neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation. Each Trk receptor binds selectively to one or two different neurotrophin (NT) signaling proteins. NT malfunction has been linked with various neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Conformational changes upon complex formation may be important contributors to binding selectivity in these signaling proteins; thus, investigation of protein motions in Trks will provide insight into the selectivity and function of the receptor, and may lead to improved design of targeted therapeutics to treat these diseases.   I have benefited from my past experiences in labs, especially in the sense that I no longer dwell on failures, and have developed greater resilience. My time in the lab constantly challenges me to think critically and make new hypothesis based on observations. the NMR aspect of the lab is completely new to me, and I have enjoyed adapting and utilizing the new technique., Clinic Volunteer The clinic provides basic services without cost for the patients.  As an undergraduate volunteer, my responsibilities were to educate patients with information regarding cholesterol and to test cholesterol levels in blood.  Volunteers are also expected to provide some nutritional advising.  It is a great opportunity to address the basic health of the patients and the importance of preventative care., College of Arts and Sciences Dean¿s List 2006-2007 The Dean's List citation is awarded annually to any student who, during the academic year from September to May, achieves a GPA of 3.7 or higher, provided he or she has completed 6 or more credit units for letter grades, has received no grades lower than C and no Incompletes during these two semesters, and has not been subject to disciplinary action., Emergency Room Tecnhician The ER Tech position provides me with a great opportunity to work in the hospital environment. This is the culmination my volunteer experiences; I can use the skills I learned during my certification while interacting directly with patients. I take vitals and medical histories, stock supplies, and dress minor wounds. The job descriptions goes much further but can be summed up in being flexible and readily available to predict what the doctors and nurses will need in each situation.  I enjoy working in such a team environment, and I am learning about life as a physician.  One of the many direct applications to a developing medical career was the bedside manner. As an ER Tech, I have a responsibility to complete certain tasks while still considering the patient's emotional and social needs. This taught me to think about more than just completing certain tasks, and consider the best way to go about completing them that would also care for the patients needs. I have learned something new from each shift, and this job confirms my aspirations to become a doctor., Church Leadership Training The Leader's Training is one of the many ways members can become involved in leadership in the church.  I helped lead the training sessions, and each week we would discuss various aspects of spiritual leadership including foundational beliefs, matters of character, and how to serve others.  The training provides members in the church to challenge themselves to serve the church in ways that stretch their comfort zones.    As one of the leaders, my role was to prepare for each week's discussions and continually evaluate the best way to proceed each week.  Each group was different, and it was important to consider their individual characteristics as we went through each topic.  The most significant part of training for me was being able to use my past experience to provide insight into many of the challenges that they are facing as new leaders.  It was both fulfilling and instructive for me to learn how to advise and others in problems or situations they may be facing.  I also spent time meeting with some of those involved in training in a one-on-one setting, addressing individual concerns and questions.  It was rewarding to see how each individual had unique styles of leadership, taking and utilizing the ideas and concepts from training to become more effective leaders., EMT-Basic Training and Certification The training involves attending class twice a week and also practical instruction where skills learned during instruction are applied. The goal of the training is to prepare for certification as an EMT-Basic.   The course has already taught me the essentials of emergency medicine including CPR and patient assessment, as well as basic trauma and medical care.  Certification for Pennsylvania was received in April 2007.  This was especially fulfilling because I have gained some skills that for the first time allow me to be a part of the medical field. This has opened future opportunities to work directly with patients and to more effectively help them return to health., US-Korea Conference 2009 The US-Korea Conference 2009 is an international research conference hosted by the Korean-American Scientists and Engineers Association (KSEA) and the Korea-US Science Cooperation Center (KUSCO).  This is a conference that brings together researchers from fields ranging from biology to aerodynamics.  This year's conference theme was global sustainability.  The conference focused on five areas: life sciences, infrastructure, fundamentals, energy, and natural resources.  My research was accepted for publication in the proceedings of this conference, and I was also able to give an oral presentation at the conference.  It was a good opportunity to network with other researchers in biochemistry, as well as those in closely related fields.  I was excited to present my undergraduate research, and to have it accepted for publication in the proceedings of UKC2009., ER Physician Shadowing This has been a valuable experience because of the many things I have seen and learned. More than the exposure to the busy day to day life of a physician, I have been fortunate enough to be able to see the thought process of an ER physician as he diagnoses patient problems. It is important to know all the possibilities associated with each symptom, but even more important to determine what the most likely cause for the symptoms.      I have also learned a great deal about the team atmosphere of the ER. It is essential for the doctors, nurses, and technicians to all work together. Every member of the team is valuable. This puts an increased emphasis on building good relationships especially among coworkers and maintaining a professional attitude. Communication is important, but flexibility and patience are even more so in an environment where patients are constantly entering and conditions are changing."

    "text": "It is not possible for me to pinpoint an exact moment or a precise time I committed myself to the idea of becoming a doctor.   I have only been able to narrow it down to a series of moments.  I would not go so far as to call them epiphanies, for my insight was more gradually earned.  Motivation for me came in the form of personal experiences with loved ones.  As I entered into high school, the need for medical practitioners began to become more apparent to me.  I witnessed a heightening in the progression of the multiple sclerosis from which my mother suffers.  In addition, both my uncle and grandfather were diagnosed with colon cancer.  Thankfully, following much intensive treatment they both were able to make recoveries.  The desire to help improve my mother's condition and the opportunity to witness what medical treatment could do for my other family members, ignited thoughts about going into the medial profession.  However, it was another experience that fully shifted my intentions toward my current path.  Several years ago my late grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  Witnessing the mental deterioration associated with that disease and the complete change in her personality that occurred, caused a great amount of trouble for me.  This tragedy, having a loved one no longer recognize who I am, really forced me to consider my own life.  After this point, it became clear I should try to become someone who could contribute to preventing these kinds of things from happening in the future.       I feel that I am now finally equipped to be successful in this field.  There are many personal and interpersonal qualities which I possess that will aid me in my journey, most of which have been gained through experience.  I am a good listener, which I consider to be absolutely necessary in dealing with patients.  My listening ability stems from a sincere care for others and a deep desire to learn all I can from people.  It is my belief that even the most challenged person has things they can teach, so there is no reason not to listen.  I have learned a great deal during my time working with underprivileged and minority groups inside and outside of the medical setting.  I have spent much time observing patient choices and asking them about their beliefs, in order to learn about and give a presentation on family planning differences between the US and Mexico.  Getting to know and understand people from many diverse backgrounds has served to spark within me a great desire to serve the disadvantaged.  During my time working in hospitals in the US and Mexico, I gained a much greater appreciation for the diversity of culture and myriad needs that exist within the population.   Through time spent in service, I have made great strides in leading and being assertive when situations dictate.  My peers, teachers and coaches have always informed me that I have a talent for leading by example.  I understand when it is necessary to lead and when to follow and I've learned to do both well.  Along these same lines, I have an aptitude for seeing situations from many different perspectives, empathizing with the circumstances, and adapting accordingly.  This versatility and openness has served to aid me in my work and will only continue to aid in my future consultation with patients.  I desire to use my experiences and learned leadership ability to someday serve others through an organization such as Operation Smile.  I've had an interest in this organization, which treats facial deformities in third world countries, ever since they visited my high school.  I believe those with no real access to medical care deserve the same kinds of treatment that are commonplace in the US.  This kind of pro bono work is the finest use of a physician's abilities, in my opinion, and I greatly desire to use my own skills in furthering these causes.   As far as my personal positive qualities, the most observable are commitment and self-awareness.  I have demonstrated commitment to becoming an MD through hard work put into academics as well as time spent in medical related service.  My self-awareness has grown exponentially in my college years from a shy and indecisive teenager into a confident and resolute young man.  From my volunteer work and time spent in hospital internship, I have become acclimated to the health care environment and have gained a better understanding of the inner workings of these organizations.  I cannot think of a better way to further develop personally and professionally and to best utilize my assets, than to begin the road to becoming an MD.  My critical thinking skills, eagerness to listen to and help others, and ability to recognize how to act and adapt in situations all serve to pave the way for success in this field.  I eagerly await the challenge and variety that comes with training to become a physician.  The interpersonal and personal abilities I have developed will only serve to better my education and ability to serve others both during and after medical school.   I realize that my journey towards becoming a physician, as directed by experience, is still only in its beginning stages.  I look forward to the continued growth and development of myself and my abilities that is to come in the future. Buckeye Boys State Buckeye boys state consisted of a weeklong set up and running of a mock government.  Government at the local, state, and national levels was mimicked in order to teach the participants about the inner workings of our country's governement.   From my position as a county judge, I was able to learn much about the law and how the judicial system works.  As a whole, the experience was a great time of bonding between complete strangers over the course of a short period of time.  It was also an opportunity to exercise teamwork and leadership skills in running a mock governement., Dean's List I have been able to earn Dean's List honors five of the six semesters I have spent at Notre Dame.  Dean's List is recognition of those students whose GPAs rank in the top thirty percent of students in their particular college.  It is a recognition that I am very proud of as well as disappointed that I did not achieve the status in all semesters., FAST I recently completed the training to become a member of the First Aid Services Team.  This organization provides urgent medical care at various athletic events around campus.  The training includes CPR and First Aid certification for victims of all ages.  The training also includes the ability to use oxygen tanks and AEDs properly.  I feel that this is very important training to have in general, even without the community service aspect.  Being able to care for others in an emergency situation is critical to those persons' survival.  I feel like I am now much better prepaired to handle an emergency situation and follow the correct course of action to help someone as best I can.  This training and program have helped to prepare me for the future when basic knowledge of medical care will be expected and thinking on one's feet will be the norm., National Merit Finalist I was granted recognition as a finalist by the national merit scholarship corporation for scoring highly on the PSAT as well as acheivement in high school academics and social service.   The award was a great honor for me and opened the door for many scholarships at institutes of higher learning around the country., Valedictorian I was recognized as one of four valedictorians from St. Francis Desales High School for high academic achievement.  It was a great honor to be recognized by my teachers and peers upon graduation.   I had worked very hard to achieve the recognition and was able to complete the goal that I had established for myself several years before., Work as Topsoil Manager I worked as the coordinator of the topsoil sales branch of TurnKey Construction.  Duties included supervision of three employees, ordering and monitoring of inventory, coordination  of delivery schedules, assisting walk-in customers with purchases and taking orders over the phone, being responsible for customer satisfaction, recording sales, balancing cash register nightly, performing general clerical duties, performing weekly payroll, occasionally operating heavy machinery: Bobcat, John Deere loader, tandem dump truck (on property), and other manual and technical responsibilities. Employment was solely during the summer months.  I am no longer a full time employee, but occasionally I will still do spot work for the company.   It was a great learning experience for me as I gained a much greater understanding of customer service and handling several simultaneous responsibilities. I was able to learn how to delegate responsibility and gain leadership experience.  Some of my responsibility consisted of being the laison between the Spanish-speakibng employees and management.  This aspect of the job allowed me to learn much about the cultural and linguistic differences that can exist in the workplace., Sports Participant Includes playing for the dorm sports teams in Ultimate Frisbee, tennis, and volleyball.  These teams went on to win championships in the inter hall league and contributed to the winning of the inter hall cup.  Also includes playing recreational league soccer and basketball.  Having the ability to play sports and stay in shape is important to me and helps me to stay well rounded.  The camaraderie and friendships built through teamwork in this area are essential to developing the  leadership and social skills necessary to become a physician., Tutor My tutoring experience consists of myself helping high school students learn chemistry and biology when I am home and helping students at Notre Dame with the same subjects while at school.  It is solely informal and not set up through any institution.  I have made it known that people can come to me for help if they need it in these areas, and occasionally they do so.  I really enjoy being able to help other people with the same problems that I have struggled with previously.  The learning that takes place is for both myself and the student. They learn the material and I am able to learn how to teach and pass on what it is that I know.  Through this experience I have greatly improved my communication skills and ability to share my own knowledge with others.  I feel that my leadership skills have improved during my time spent helping others better learn their material., Poster Presentation Seminar and poster presentation of findings in lab over the course of two semesters.  Through this experience I was able to learn how to present findings, in the way necessary for a scientific meeting.   I presented on genetic engineering as it pertains to bacteria and the green flourescent protein marker.  In order to present, I needed to first understand how to speak and explain findings in front of a large group of knowledgable people.  My public speaking proficiency and ability to condense information into its essentials were both grealty improved over the course of prepairing and giving this presentation., Genetic Study The experience consisted of a semester long study of the mutations that cause retinal degeneration in fruit flies.  The study was comprised of a series of related experiments leading to a genetic and molecular characterization of the mutation.  The directed research project culminated in the writing of a complex research paper describing the experiment, findings, and implications.  Over the course of this project I was able to learn a great deal about the techniques needed to carry out a long term experiment as well as the necessary attention to detail.  The program required the participants to stay on task and complete each leg of the process on time and without error.  Through this experience I gained a much greater appreciation for all that goes into a research project and was able to mentally prepare myself to handle these aspects again in the future., Social Service-Working with kids The experience consisted of work and play with children at a Mexican school.  The children needed to remain at school while their parents worked.  The students at UDLA would watch over them and help to entertain them during this time after classes had ended. It was very rewarding to be able to work with small children and be able to brighten their day.  I am sure that I enjoyed my time their just as much as the children probably did.  It was great to work with children and to learn what it takes to work with children in general., Volunteer-Local Service The experience consisted of work through the civil authority of the area commission of Linden, an underprivileged neighborhood of Columbus.  Projects included general beautification as well as health related awareness efforts.  Awareness projects encompassed door to door passing on of information about diseases and availability of vaccination.  I was able to learn much about the lack of understanding of medicine and medical procedures that can exist among the population.  It helped me to aspire to increase comprehension and knowledge about medicine in areas where access to medicine and information may be lacking.   My desire to help the community only increased through this experience, as I was able to assist the people of this community and see the returns that came about through our work., Medical Internship The experience was comprised of internship in a Mexican hospital as part of a medical internship program, through the Notre Dame study abroad program.  The internship included observation of doctors and treatments given.  There was limited patient interaction, but work included taking of blood pressure and assisting doctors during surgical and other procedures.  I was able to learn much about medicine in general and the Mexican medical system as well as observe the differences in treatment of Spanish-speaking patients.  It was a great opportunity for me to closely experience what occurs in the hospital and what being a doctor  truly requires.  I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to improve my Spanish-speaking and to work with patients in a hospital., Volunteer-ER Volunteer work in the Emergency Room in which duties included organization of paperwork, transport of patients, guiding of family members through the ER to their loved ones, and general cleaning and prep of waiting and patient rooms.  Through this experience I was able to gain a better understanding of the inner workings of the hospital and observe the doctor-patient relationship.  It served to strengthen my desire to become a physician by allowing me to see what truly goes on in a clinical setting and what being a physician entails.  I greatly enjoyed being a part of the health care team and playing a role in helping the patients recover.   The experience helped to strengthen my desire to become a physician by allowing me to observe what is truly required of a physician on duty., Work as assistant to management team Work consisted of many daily responsibilities and individual jobs as handed down by the management of the golf course.  Daily responsibilities included general maintenance of golf carts and course, cleaning and sorting of members clubs and bags, and retrieval of members clubs upon request or for scheduled tee times.  Other jobs included cleaning of the facility, set up for events or tournaments, and maintenance of driving ranges.  While working there I learned much about adhering to a schedule and dealing with customers in a non-sales situation.  Teamwork was a very important part of the working environment and I was able to learn much about what it takes to work in a group.    It consituted the first time I had been employed by a company other than Turnkey Consturuction and was fulfilling to find that I could handle other types of work.  I enjoyed my time there and enjoyed meeting all of the members of the club.  It was a great learning experience."

    "text": "I was only twelve years old when I traveled with my parents for the second time to China, where we were going to adopt my youngest sister, Claire.  Three years earlier, we had adopted my sister, Ellen; however this trip would prove to be much different.  Upon receiving Claire, we found that she showed severe autistic symptoms. We brought her home, and my parents immediately set out to find the best care for my sister.  The search led us to an international adoption clinic, where pediatricians, therapists, and nurses worked together to solve the puzzle that was Claire, and to tease out the many underlying causes of her behaviors.  The entire family became immersed in her care, and after a year and a half, my sister made a remarkable breakthrough.  Today, Claire is a healthy, boisterous third grader.      Seeing the struggles my family and other adoptive families had, as well as the excellent care given by the adoption clinic, my previous interest in medicine was given purpose and direction.  Growing up in a family with many relatives involved in medicine, I had been exposed to the demands and joys of working in the field.  The procedures and problem solving that occurred in their daily duties appealed to my scientific curiosity.  However, in observing Claire's progress, I had the opportunity to see that medical care was more than competently carrying out technical procedures and mental algorithms.  For my family, it involved the hope that a physician can give to a family.  I saw the qualities that patients find most important in their doctors, as well as the difficulties faced by both patients and doctors on the path to healing.  My family had originally sparked my interest in science and medicine, but it was Claire's situation that fueled my passion for medicine.        Since then, I have had the fortunate opportunity to travel on several medical mission trips. During one of these trips I assisted in makeshift clinics in several small towns in Peru.  It was while working with the physicians, dentists, and nurses in the dust and dirt that I saw medicine at its finest.  The people were inexpressibly grateful for the care the doctors gave, and the joy the doctors had in their work was contagious.  My greatest memory was when a young girl came to have several decaying teeth extracted.  I was working as a dental assistant, and sensed her fear.  In my broken Spanish, I offered to hold her hand, and so spent the whole procedure balancing a tray with instruments and gauze in one hand, while holding her small hand in the other.  Taking a more active role in medicine gave me the opportunity to develop my own skills, but also to observe and learn from the professionals around me.  I was captivated by the doctors' ability to diagnose with limited language skills, administer treatments in very primitive conditions, and the way in which each nurse, dentist, and physician could comfort their patient.        I have a strong desire to work within international adoption medicine and pediatrics, as well as on missions and outreaches.  My fascination for medicine, my enthusiasm for mission work, and my life experiences have all helped to affirm my choice of career paths, and each has provided groundwork for that pursuit.  I have developed a heart for medicine, but more importantly, a heart for the patient. Recipient An Oxford Scholar.

    "text": "There she was, hunched over the bed, looking pale and blurry-eyed with her brown hair in a tangled mess across her face.  Her bright green room was in disarray, littered with vodka bottles and vomit.  This sight of confusion and panic greeted me as I walked into Paula's room at 3:00AM on a Saturday, a stark contrast to the image of a usually cheery young woman.  Reflecting back, my interest in the sciences started at an early age but it was in helping Paula as her resident assistant (RA) and the experiences I encountered afterwards that solidified my goals of engaging in medicine.  It was during my fourth week as an RA that I saw Paula returning to her room heavily intoxicated.  Academic anxiety and parental demands had affected her and a week of training did little to prepare me for the high-pressure situation I encountered.  Facing me was a resident who was scared, semi-conscious, and over-worked.  My sympathy only intensified when I heard her slurred pleas to not call the emergency medical service because of her family's financial strains.  Despite her complaints and constant assurances of I'm fine, I chose her safety as my main concern and called 911.  That night I held her hand as she underwent detoxification.  She confided in me with detailed accounts of how hard it was transitioning to a new life and how her father recently lost his job.  The following week I offered her encouragement as she faced a meeting with judicial affairs, advising her to be honest and sincere despite the regret she felt for her actions.  It was then that I realized how much my RA position had in common with clinical practice.  To make the right decisions under pressure, to be responsible for the well being of another, and to instill a sense of trust in the patient are all qualities necessary in medicine.  I was not able to reverse the harm done to Paula's body, but I was able to support her in turning this near-death situation into a meaningful learning experience for both of us.  She sought out help from the academic advising center and took on a part-time job at the library to help pay for her tuition.  Her story emphasized to me that providing care to others is much more than just learning knowledge from textbooks, because it also requires a strong person-to-person relationship, an important skill I witnessed while interning at Duke University Medical Center.  I saw how much those doctors had embodied these characteristics in their practices by showing a strong dedication to their patients and a genuine commitment to their profession.  They treated each patient as an individual, taking the extra time to answer questions and address concerns.  During my internship, I would arrive early so that I could observe the team of oncologists as they began their morning rounds.  As we walked through the door to a sixty-three year old patient diagnosed with colorectal cancer, it amazed me how the doctor's simple gesture of holding her hand while speaking brought a smile to her face.  I spent the rest of that morning talking to Mrs. Warren, listening to stories about her daughter who rarely visited due to work commitments, and comforting her as she spoke with tears in her eyes.  Gradually I steered our conversation away from sadness to laughter as we talked about her hobbies.  She enjoyed adorning cards for her grandchildren and neighbors, and making special cutouts to use as shopping lists.  During the next hour, we decorated thank you notes to send to well-wishers.  At the same time I discovered an incredible gratification knowing that my company, even for a few hours, made her day a little brighter.  The patient I met has long since returned home, but the impact she left on me motivated me to learn more about her disease.  Over the past several summers, I researched the interactions between colon cancer growth and a tumor suppressor gene in Dr. Joanna Groden's medical genetics lab at Ohio State University, with the goal that this knowledge may lead to drug therapy for the many patients afflicted with gastrointestinal cancer.  My mentor stimulated my thinking towards alternate hypotheses that opened my mind to reexamining my approach and interpretation.  It became an ongoing and creative learning process that finally allowed me to make the connection between the laboratory and clinic, to bridge the gap between basic science and its application.  From this, I saw not only the potential of medicine to alleviate illness but also the power of compassion to heal the human being.    I have thus reaffirmed my original path towards medicine, with a deeper appreciation for what my experiences have taught me.  It was my sense of responsibility that helped Paula through her ordeal and empathy that brought laughter to Mrs. Warren.  As a physician, I hope to serve as a compassionate individual, helping patients through difficult decisions and painful moments.  I want to be a mentor, guiding patients toward living healthy lifestyles and encouraging them to break bad habits.  Science classes and laboratory research have taught me the fundamental concepts in medicine, but equally important is the compassion I bring, which sometimes may be as simple as holding out a caring hand or crafting a friendly card. Dean's List After some early struggles, my grades significantly and progressively improved in my third and fourth years as I learned new methods to studying and applied a new learning style.  I earned Dean's List from Spring 2007 to Fall 2007 by placing in the highest third of undergraduates within my college.  In my final semester, I received Dean's List with Distinction by placing in the top ten percent., Student Assistant As a part of the work-study program, I supported faculty in examining how factors such as education level, socioeconomic status, marital status, and parenting style affects children's behaviors.  Some of my duties included tracking research expenses, coding data for use in publications, and organizing presentations during conferences.  I was also heavily involved in two separate projects.  In the Durham Family Initiative, which assesses risk factors of child abuse, I researched library and online journal databases to provide background information for the project director.  In Project M.O.M., a longitudinal study that analyzes predictors of problematic parenting, I periodically tracked participants to limit problems with attrition.  This experience brought to my attention the apparent difference in lifestyles between campus students and the local community, and I became more aware of the challenges that face families with limited resources.  I found a new urgency to help put these initiatives and programs into action to provide support for those families most at risk., Research Assistant Because of the close interactions I had with a patient, I became interested in her disease and dedicated my summers to understanding more about the factors that contribute to an inherited susceptibility to gastrointestinal cancers.  My project specifically focused on identifying the role of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor in association with the hTID-1 protein in accelerating cell death in the colon.  Since the summer only lasted three months, I had to quickly learn many detailed protocols and techniques while applying them with efficiency and accuracy to my experiments.  In addition, I found it crucial to keep current with scientific developments and spent many hours outside the lab researching new publications that offered different approaches to stimulate my thinking.  My mentor supported my curiosity by providing me with critical feedback and objective evaluations of the data I collected, encouraging me to always explore alternative hypotheses and to be persistent when experiments did not work out at first.  Finally, weekly lab meetings became a particularly useful tool as I became more skilled at presenting empirical data in a clear, concise, and organized manner., Patient Advocate From this experience, I gained critical insight into the medical profession both from the physician's perspective and from that of the patient's.  While following healthcare providers on rounds, I observed how they functioned as a team by being available and responsive to their colleagues, working in collaboration to develop treatments.  I realized the importance of patient confidentiality, because they always kept their discussions private, only involving those caring for that patient.  Furthermore, I was impressed to see a strong dedication to patients as they continued to offer quality care for a terminally ill individual by visiting him often and offering sincere support for his family.  From another view, my one-on-one interactions with patients allowed me to get to know them personally, learning about their most treasured memories and greatest anxieties.  On several occasions, my familiarity with and attentiveness to patients allowed me to serve as a trusted advocate on their behalf in alerting the nursing staff to special concerns.  It was incredibly rewarding to know that my companionship lifted the spirits of those who were ill from treatment or separated from their families.  My conversations with them and the smiles I received further encouraged my interest in the health professions., Resident Assistant I applied for the RA position as a self-challenge.  It was important that I was placed outside my comfort zone so that I could be exposed to and learn from a diverse range of people.  During the last 3 years, I dealt with real-life incidents in stressful situations, completed administrative responsibilities in a reliable manner, and initiated activities to support the social and educational pursuits of fellow students, while assisting them on a daily basis with issues involving roommate conflicts, mental health, and academics.  From this, I learned to understand the meaning of people's stories in the context of their cultural systems by avoiding being judgmental, the same skill that is needed in patient care.  This experience developed my leadership abilities by allowing me to build a community within a multicultural dorm, encourage personal growth, and at the same time learn how to effectively deal with confrontations., Tutor I learned of this opportunity while taking a service-learning course that applies what is learned in class into bettering the community through service.  The tutoring program matches disadvantaged middle and high school students from low-income, single parent homes with Duke students.  One of the most difficult parts about this experience is motivating students who have little belief in their academics.  Meeting with them twice a week is rarely enough to change their perspectives about the importance of education since most plan to enter the work force directly after high school.  It became a challenge to stress the importance of life-long learning while respecting their unique backgrounds and realizing the limitations of their families and the environment.  Not only did I commit to tutoring them in homework assignments and test preparations, I encouraged them to seek college information from guidance counselors and on the web.  By using my own intellectual curiosity and enthusiasm as an example, I helped a female student prepare her application for admission to a local college towards the end of the year., Teaching Assistant I reinforced materials taught in lecture classes by clarifying course content and stimulating application of concepts through experimentation.  I instructed students during laboratory demonstrations, holding weekly office hours, and offering extra discussion sessions before exams.  Oftentimes, I had to adapt the lab manual to better fit the relevancy of the course and comprehension level of students.  My goal was not to have all the answers for questions but to facilitate discussion and guide students toward reaching their own conclusions.  Because most students who take the course are in their first year, I also advised them in developing new approaches to learning in ways that were consistent with the demands of a college curriculum by sharing some of my own experiences.  The benefits were not one sided however, because it gave me an opportunity to review concepts as I taught them and challenged me to find unique ways in helping others understand., Intern Since graduation, I have been dedicated to learning about medicine from its multitude of facets.  I want to use this valuable time and look at medical care from a financial perspective in billing and budgeting because providing quality, affordable healthcare to patients has become an increasingly pressing issue particularly in underserved populations.  The first aspect of my work is following up on claims to insurance companies so that treatments are paid for properly and patients are not overcharged.  This also involves talking with patients directly to learn about their financial situations and to ensure that they are provided care regardless of their ability to pay.  The second component involves calculating and tracking the multi-million dollar budget for the hospital.  From this, I now have a good sense of how a hospital is run and a general knowledge of the various departments that work in conjunction for proper patient care.  Together, my work has taught me the importance of placing patients first by finding solutions to accommodate the needs of each family so that they may have access to superior healthcare., Research Aid The circadian clock regulates many physiological and developmental processes in organisms through the sleep/wake cycle.  The lab is looking into this oscillating mechanism by measuring how environmental signals such as light absorption affect Arabidopsis plant growth.  This was my first exposure to the lab environment and I gained many insights into how the lab is run and how different members worked as a team to contribute to research goals.  My tasks included keeping lab order, maintaining plants, obtaining and analyzing DNA extractions, and preparing tissue samples.  At first, it surprised me to learn that this research has important significance in the medical setting because plants are so far removed from patients.  However, I quickly saw the connection between the human biological clock and the plant circadian rhythm.  As much as light is involved in plant growth, it is also a key factor in promoting melatonin secretion and regulating body temperature.  In addition, a disruption of the circadian cycle in humans, most easily detected when experiencing jet lag or dealing with sleep disorders, can lead to a number of health problems.  Because of this, my work with plants led to a better understanding of the human body., Co-Director The stress of relocating to a new environment and the challenges of schoolwork have oftentimes led students to disregard their health, citing not enough time as a common excuse.  I want to alter this misconception and promote healthy living by showing that even small changes can better one's health.  For this, my team organized a series of campaign ads showing fellow students eating right, exercising, and taking care of their bodies.  Along with this, we educated our peers by passing out pamphlets that showed the nutrition content of meals offered at the cafeteria and demonstrated how a variety of foods are necessary to compose a balanced diet.  To translate our message into action, we hosted a weekly basketball tournament to encourage students to come to the gym.  Not only did I learn many facts about healthy lifestyles, but we were also able to motivate many of our peers into adopting these habits.  By the time spring semester came, our pickup games had expanded to include teams from every dorm on East campus."

    "text": "After three days spent recovering from a parasite infection, I was five pounds lighter, lethargic, and weak. I had no energy or desire to work. Miserable and unable to eat, I spent my mornings shaded from the sun as others trekked back and forth for miles carrying the cement blocks for the school. Luisa, one of the girls who lived in the village, shyly sat down across from me. Looking into her eyes, I saw her innocent hope for a playmate. I held out my hand and said cinco. A huge smile crept across her face as she reached out for mine and gave me a high five. I began motioning to different body parts, teaching her the English words, as she repeated them in K'iche', her native language. Quickly, more children came and joined us, learning English and laughing at my attempt to pronounce words in K'iche'. Although the experience may seem insignificant to some, in both medicine and faith, small rewards, like the smile on Luisa's face, are what  motivate me.  Interactions such as these have spurred my passion for medicine, and its integration of intellect and heart. In Guatemala, I stepped out of my comfortable, air- conditioned home and entered a lifestyle where floors were made of dirt, baths were taken in a river, and meat was a luxury. Here, the resources and aid we could provide were inadequate to the vast need. The Guatemalans looked to my team as the doctors, able to bring relief and joy. They had pains, aches, and illnesses yet we could only pray and offer our meager supply of vitamins and aspirin in return. I felt helpless. From my firsthand encounter of sickness, I learned how easily preventable diseases prevail in these communities. Whereas religion was the answer for many things, I knew that medicine would allow me to fill the gaps that religion could not.  As a doctor, I could reach out in a far more tangible, and in certain communities, useful way. The mission trip catalyzed my desire to work amongst underserved populations, and I see medicine as the way to contribute something practical to ministries like these.   To supplement my experience with disadvantaged communities, I volunteered at a local ER, which served a community of urban poor, and worked with an inner city ministry in Over-the-Rhine in Cincinnati, Ohio. Although vastly different in terms of responsibilities, I interacted with people from various socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. In both jobs, I related to people with diverse sets of experiences, a valuable ability for future interactions with other patients and medical professionals. In addition to developing my communication skills, I was confronted with the realities of the health care system today: insurance problems interfering in patient care, long wait times, and a shortage of primary care physicians. This reinforced the idea that a doctor's responsibilities, such as diagnosing and healing, should be rooted in care that supercedes logistical concerns.  Although drawn to the compassion in medicine, I knew that I must also understand and master the practical aspects of being a doctor. Whereas Guatemala taught me about faith and compassion, researching in Dr. Huang's Human Cancer Genetics lab allowed me to apply my goals more scientifically. I specifically studied the effect that interleukin-6 has on estrogen signaling in breast tumor microenvironment. From this experience emerged my preference for examining the human body macroscopically, focusing not on one specific aspect of a disease, but by seeing the whole picture: the entire patient.   While my time in Guatemala drew me to medicine, serving in my non-denominational, multi-ethnic church fortified  the leadership and discipline to pursue medicine. In my various roles on the church staff, not only have I been guided in different areas of ministry, but I have guided others as well, directing a Vacation Bible School for elementary students. Whether planning skits or leading a bible study, I prepare in advance, complete any last-minute tasks, and remain until the end, performing the unseen chores to ensure that everything is in order. A true leader undertakes the roles that others choose to leave undone. Each role -- whether educational, administrative, or janitorial -- are all aspects of service that together foster the growth and cohesive development of the church, and that of my personal life as well. \t   Whether serving in my church, or in a rural village thousands of miles away, my lessons in faith have only strengthened my passion to be a doctor. Some believe the paths of medicine and faith to be divergent. One rests its case on the concretely proven results of scientific inquiry; the latter depends on a faith in things unseen. For that reason, many dismiss religion as fantastic or implausible. With both as significant pursuits in my life, I have found that for me, my faith draws me to medicine. While volunteering in the ER and researching have developed my critical understanding of medicine and the inquisitive mind that it requires, it was in Guatemala that I first became attuned to the need for all forms of healing.  It is in the smiles of Luisa and of my future patients where I will find my purpose in medicine. Columbus Fellowship of Christ staff/member As a member of the Columbus Fellowship of Christ leadership team, I worked with a group of staff engaging in a variety of different activities. On Fellowship team, I led games and events, and welcomed newcomers to foster a sense of community and ownership within the church. For various camps, I mentored middle school girls through discussions and prayer to derive greater understanding of sermons, current and past experiences, and to spur growth. In prayer ministry, I interacted with others and oversaw events for the purpose of relieving the stress and burdens of others and serving the group. As a Children's Ministry teacher, I taught elementary students through sermons, skits, games, and bible study to cultivate strong morals and encourage cooperation and kindness. In addition, I headed a Vacation Bible School in which I delegated tasks while supervising the camp.  These positions brought cohesion and growth to the fellowship as a whole, in addition to the development and maturation of individuals., Denman Undergraduate Research Forum As a participant of the Denman Undergraduate Research Forum, I presented my research project entitled Increased IL-6 Expression Level from Breast Tumor Microenvironment Activates Estrogen Signaling Pathway in Cancer Cells. Subjecting a breast cancer cell line to different treatments, I found that the expression of PS2, a hallmark of estrogen signaling, is elevated up to 3 fold in cancer-associated fibroblasts in response to conditioned media containing high levels of IL-6. Adding IL-6 neutralizing antibody suppressed PS2 expression, suggesting that IL-6 secreted by breast tumor microenvironment activates estrogen signaling. These results indicate that tumor microenvironment factors play an important role in cancer growth. Explaining my work before three judges, I discussed the elements and steps of the project, the importance in studying cytokines, and possible avenues for further investigation., Leukemia Tissue Bank, Technician As a technician at the Leukemia Tissue Bank, I use aseptic technique to procure blood samples received from hospitals all over the United States. Beginning with a sample of either bone marrow or peripheral blood, the lymphocytes are isolated and purified for cryopreservation for the purpose of improving existing patient therapies and supporting innovative research and correlative studies. Depending on the requirements of each study, I extract RNA and prepare cytological slides for researchers to analyze the effects of previously performed treatments. I work efficiently and professionally, ensuring that patient confidentiality is not compromised., Customer Service Manager At F.H.I. Heat, a hair appliances manufacturer, I managed the Customer Service department, accomodating client needs and ensuring that all parties were satisfied. Using strong communication skills, I articulated the return policy and regulated reimbursements. In implementing Excel spreadsheets to record returns and complaints, I increased the efficiency of the headquarters. While only serving as a summer intern, my work eased the burden on co-workers., Dean's List At The Ohio State University, I have been on the Dean's List seven times, including for the past five consecutive quarters enrolled as a full-time student. Achieving the Dean's List requires a minimum 3.5 gpa., Cello I began playing cello in the seventh grade. My background in music enabled me to excel in cello, and I joined my church orchestra. The orchestra played every sunday service and at Korean culture events. In addition, I took lessons until entering college, and I performed solos and duets at recitals., Mission Trip to Guatemala I went to Guatemala with a team of 48 other high school, college, and young adults on a three week Christian, service-oriented trip. I taught English to elementary and middle school students, led a series of crafts and games to engage the children, and performed skits and songs before large crowds. Also, I helped carry cement blocks to and lay the concrete foundation for an elementary school in a remote village. This trip opened my eyes to the immense spiritual and physical needs of underserved populations, and the experience sparked my desire to work in remote areas where opportunities and resources are scarce., Human Cancer Genetics Research Intern Researching under Dr. Huang, the director of the Center for Integrative Cancer Biology, and Dr. Huey-Jen Lin, I assisted in several different research projects, which focused on the effect of epigenetic gene silencing and the effect of cytokines on breast tumor microenvironment. I began the position with autoclaving, cell culture, maintaining laboratory equipment, and preparing reagents. As I gained their confidence, they gave me greater undertakings, ultimately leading to an independent researching role studying the effect of increased interleukin-6 in breast tumor microenvironment on estrogen signaling. I isolated DNA and RNA and performed reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to analyze gene expression and the effect of experimental treatments on cancer cells. The data obtained from my research was presented in the annual American Association for Cancer Research forum. Also, a journal article discussing the results is being drafted. In addition to my research, I was responsible for different cell lines and assisted in others' research projects, both experimentally and in data management, one of which led to a journal article currently under peer review., Breast Cancer-associated Fibroblasts Confer AKT1-mediated... The paper, Breast Cancer-associated Fibroblasts Confer AKT1-mediated Epigenetic Silencing of Cystatin M in Epithelial Cells, is currently undergoing peer review and is expected to be published this year. The findings suggest that tumor microenvironment stimuli are triggers in epigenetic gene silencing in cancer, including long-term silencing of cystatin M, a tumor suppressor gene. A causal mechanism is proposd for how tumor stromal fibroblasts support neoplastic progression by manipulating the epigenome of mammary epithelial cells. The result also reveals the importance of direct contact between epithelial cells and the surrounding fibroblasts that causes epigenetic alterations. In addition, the co-culture system implemented in this research can be used to uncover epithelial factors that direct epigenetic changes in stromal fibroblast in future studies., University and Ross Heart Hospital Volunteer Volunteering at Ross Heart and University Hospitals, I supported various  departments, including the Pacer Lab, the Nisonger Center for Children with Learning Disabilities, and the Emergency Department. While learning about cardiovascular conditions in the Pacer Lab, I aided in administrative duties, which increased the efficiency of the lab and prepared me for the less glamorous roles of medicine. Working at the Nisonger Center, a University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, reinforced the importance of compassionate and personalized medicine. I slowly gained the trust and cooperation of the children as I spent the afternoons helping with the art sessions, encouraging cooperation between students, and performing ending day rituals. Working with children with mental disabilities that hinder their retention and capabilities reminded me to be patient and caring despite their sometimes obstinate attitudes. In the Emergency Department, I aided in staff duties, including assisting in patient sign-in, guiding family members of patients, and maintaining the wait area. I became familiar with the Emergency Department, the roles of the staff, and the variance in patients and their injuries or illnesses., Honors Program With my admission to The Ohio State University, I was also granted acceptance into the Honors Program, which demands a more rigorous course load and an Honors Contract approved by the Arts and Sciences Honors Committee. In 2005, acceptance into the Honors Program required a minimum 1300 SAT score, graduating in the top 10% of one's class, and a minimum 3.5 gpa. Succeeding in the program offers the distinction of graduating with honors."

    "text": "My parents are Taiwanese immigrants and raised me in a conservative and controlling household, choosing nearly all of my activities and hobbies. As I grew older my parents' strong opinions directly influenced my collegiate major and future career plans. Their chosen profession for me, medicine, was in large part meant to serve as a way out of a lifetime of financial struggles they had experienced as immigrants.  Thus, out of high school, encumbered by a sense of duty and obligation, I found myself on a track to medical school.  A few years into college, I was involved in a car accident that required me to take an extended leave from my studies.  During this unplanned break, which allowed me a certain distance from the grind of my pre-med program, I came to realize that living up to my parents' expectations had become onerous. I needed to make a change and find a new path for myself.  The field of business and public policy attracted me.  My father's reaction to this rebellion was cutting me off in every way imaginable short of signing legal papers. He did not speak to me or allow me even to come home.  My mother was no more supportive.  I remember her words well: You are not as fortunate as others.  Our love for you is conditional.  I was devastated, but I knew then that the price of such a love was not one I was willing to pay and that its rejection was the beginning of my search for my own life.  The following years led me to jobs in the financial industry, and I eventually settled into a position as an analyst for Standard & Poor's in New York City.  To help alleviate my family's financial straits, I also worked nights and weekends as a bartender.  The wide range of people I met through these disparate jobs was enlightening, opening up my eyes to the countless possibilities of how one could choose to live.  In August 2004, I was injured in an escalator accident that turned my then comfortable life upside down.  Despite the hardship it incurred, this incident would prove to be the greatest catalyst in my decision to once again pursue a career in medicine.  I was on an escalator that suddenly jolted to a full stop, sending the man behind me flying into me as I was fighting to keep myself from falling.  The accident left me with torn ligaments in my wrist and an inexplicable twitch in my neck that could only be calmed by seizure medication.  It was the beginning of a 16-month ordeal that sent me to a seemingly endless number of neurologists and movement disorder specialists across New York.  I was subjected to tests of every kind, each leaving me without a satisfying diagnosis or a cure.    During this period of personal crisis, I had an unexpected revelation.  Even though there was no end in sight for my physical problems, I had met doctors who truly cared for me and did all they could do to make me whole again.  Over time, the twitch in my neck gradually went away and surgeons were able to repair my wrist.  In retrospect, the healing of my psyche was even more profound.  I realized in the end that the hope and support imparted by my doctors were ultimately what pulled me through this trying time.    In searching for an answer to my injuries, I submerged myself in all the medical reports about my condition I could find.  What I discovered instead is that I felt an excitement and an insatiable curiosity to learn more about medicine.  After years in search of a dream, I had come to realize quite accidentally - no pun intended - that it had been in a place I had shut out of my life long ago. Ironically, the need to create my own identity and free myself from my parents' iron fist had obscured the line of sight to my dreams.    With this newfound passion, I moved to Boston and enrolled in a post-baccalaureate program.  I became a volunteer at a local hospital emergency department serving the surrounding underprivileged community.  There, I gained a greater understanding of the commitment, integrity, and emotional demands required of a physician.  Personal interactions with the patients were what I found most gratifying.  One day I would feed a homeless man his lunch as he sat on the hospital bed, and the next I would be holding a woman's hand and comforting her as she was underwent a very painful procedure.  My own experiences after the accident taught me that good medicine is not just possessing technical mastery of the problem at hand, but also doling out generous helpings of empathy, compassion, and kindness.  I seem to fit the clich of the traveler who has taken Robert Frost's proverbial road less traveled by. My life has had many twists and turns, some unfortunate, some advantageous, but I feel strangely lucky about it all. My hope is that someday I will be able to use my experience on the giving end, returning the holistic care of the teachers and doctors who treated both my Aristotelian selves of psyche and physique. In my own career as a physician, I will strive to become a caretaker, healer, and friend, regarding my patients, my family, my work, and my life all with unconditional love. Standard & Poor's Senior Research Assistant As an analyst, I conducted detailed analysis on new receivables being added to credit card trusts using cash flow analysis and performance trend evaluation. I presented my findings and recommendations to a committee, answering any questions that arose to defend my position. When I first joined, it was immediately apparent that the group lacked strong computer skills, so I began learning Visual Basic for Applications, which was used for building financial models. I gained quantitative experience through the learning process and very quickly became the go-to person for computer issues. I played an instrumental role in the development, debugging, implementation, and maintenance of S&P's Credit Card Trust Tracker, a database which tracks specific program metrics such as issuance capacity, maturities, and various weighted average calculations.  Through this experience, I learned to work alongside and respect many who were 10 to 25 years my senior. The presentations allowed me to gain the confidence and business acumen necessary in the profession. It was important for me to work closely with everyone in my group, communicate effectively, and give concise reasoning for my analysis. I believe the variety of skills I acquired through this experience will prove to be beneficial in a future career as a physician., Beginning With Children Charter School Volunteer As part of the Urban Semester Program at Cornell University, I volunteered as a teacher's assistant at the BWC Charter School in Brooklyn.  For one day a week, I assisted the teacher with daily activities such as art, music, and science in a first grade classroom.  Most of the students at this inner-city school came from abused homes, poverty-stricken homes, or lived in homeless shelters.  Acting as a mentor to the children, I was able to develop close relationships with them and was inspired by the resilience, strength, and spirit the children displayed despite the adversity they had experienced or were still dealing with at home.    In addition to volunteering at the school, I toured healthcare facilities and community centers devoted to the surrounding underprivileged population. It was only a glimpse into the wide array of issues and challenges faced by underserved communities, but I learned the importance of health education and awareness in the population.   It is the lack of education in underprivileged communities that can contribute to the higher incidence of certain preventable diseases., Public Policy Research Assistant - Cornell University At Cornell, I worked as a research assistant for a professor who dealt with educational testing policy. The research project set out to determine the effect standardized tests had on children in the US from kindergarten through high school. It gradually became apparent that there was a trend showing a direct relationship between the number of exams administered and the high school dropout rate, which was contrary to what was expected. It seemed that constantly reminding students of their performance relative to their peers increased their likelihood of dropping out of school.   When I joined the team, vast amounts of data obtained over the years had to be consolidated, organized, and interpreted for each state. Utilizing my analytical and computer skills, I had formulated a database storage system, which simplified retrieval and manipulation of the vast amounts of data. When gaps were found in the data, I contacted the state boards of education to obtain the missing information. Additionally, I began writing a summary and analysis for each state to begin a working draft for future publication. I learned of the complications that can arise with data integrity when working with historical data, including varied sources, unaccountable time gaps, and difficulties in validation of data., Undergraduate Academic Scholarships Awarded the following renewable scholarships for outstanding academic achievement:  Fall 1997:  Arizona State University Regents Academic Scholarship  Fall 1997: Tempe Diablos Student Academic Scholarship  Spring 1998: Asian American Student Academic Scholarship, Server/Bartender Beginning in my freshman year in college, I began working in the restaurant industry. Throughout college, I usually held 2 to 3 jobs at a time, with one working as a server or bartender. It was the type of position that allowed me to support myself financially while maintaining a regular class schedule during the day. With the exception of the time period I spent recovering from a car accident during college, I usually worked 3 to 4 nights, or 15 to 25 hours per week in a restaurant or bar. Upon graduation from college in January 2003, I continued bartending and maintained a full-time position in finance to help my family through the financial difficulties.  Working in the service industry has been beneficial in my own personal growth. Long hours at the restaurant led to improved time management skills and a strengthened work ethic. My communication and listening skills improved tremendously during this time as I learned to quickly adapt and cater to the needs and expectations of each individual. Similar to the doctor-patient relationship, each customer was unique and solicited different forms of communication and methods of service from me. I also worked closely with other members of the service staff, learning the importance of teamwork and continuous communication to maximize quality of service., Summer Premedical Enrichment Program Currently, I am participating in a six-week summer premedical enrichment program at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. The full-time intensive program is very competitive, accepting only 18 premedical students from an applicant pool of over 600 students. This immersion into the world of medicine is designed to equip students with the tools necessary to be successful medical students and future physicians. The program includes a cardiovascular physiology course as well as many workshops in areas such as individual skills assessments, test-taking strategies, medical school preparation, and current issues and developments in medicine.    The clinical component of the program involved shadowing physicians in Cincinnati's University Hospital and the VA Hospital for eight hours per week in the areas of cardiology, neurology, cardiothoracic surgery, and vascular surgery. The variety of clinical experiences was invaluable in that I was able to observe many different settings in which the doctor interacts with the patient, whether it was routine, post-operative, or intensive care. Through shadowing experiences and the variety of lectures I have had in this program, I have gained a better understanding of the physician's role and the challenges physicians as well as the healthcare as a whole face., Reader services for visually impaired individuals For 12 hours per week, I worked for a government contractor that contracted disability services for government employees.  I worked part-time assisting a woman who was visually impaired and worked as a Civil Rights Officer at the Federal Transportation Administration.  My duties to her included reading legal documents, complaints from individuals, and various administrative duties.  In addition to reading the documents, I provided additional input in the analysis of possible violations in Equal Opportunity Employment, Civil Rights, and Americans With Disabilities Act.  During my employment with the government contractor, I also assisted another visually impaired woman with her daily work functions.  She worked as an assistant teacher at Fenway High School in Boston and needed assistance with her lesson plans.  This experience gave me a greater appreciation and understanding for people with disabilities.  The coping mechanisms they developed and incorporated into their daily lives to be able to function with their disabilities were extraordinary and something many of us normally take for granted.  The strength, perseverance to succeed, and strong work ethic they displayed were truly humbling and admirable., Merrill Lynch Private Client Group Internship For a semester, I worked in an unpaid internship with senior financial advisors in preparing client portfolio analyses and researched Merrill Lynch product offerings pertaining to individual clients.  About 20 percent of my time was devoted to making cold calls to various companies or residences to attempt to solicit interest from high net worth individuals in developing a financial portfolio with the Private Client Group. I assisted in preparing marketing campaigns and organizing investment strategy seminars for potential clients.  I produced daily detailed reports on market research and current industry trends, continually looking for ways to improve the client service model., Wood Hudson Cancer Research Lab For eight months, I worked in a non-profit cancer research lab as a research assistant twenty-five hours per week.  I gained experience in cell culture techniques as well as DNA extraction from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.  The genotyping of cancer and non-cancer tissues was accomplished through the use of PCR techniques and capillary electrophoresis.  The main project I worked on was looking at two variants in the TGF-beta receptor gene as a potential biomarker to be used in early detection of various types of cancer.  The manuscript from this project, as related to ovarian cancer, is currently being submitted for journal review for possible publication.    Through this lab research experience, I gained a greater appreciation for the complexity of cancer and its many pathways.  I learned the importance of data integrity, keeping an accurate laboratory notebook, and maintaining patient confidentiality.  The translational research performed in this lab as well as other research labs, plays an integral part in the eventual application of screening tests or treatments.  In addition to working in the lab, I also became involved in journal club and fundraising, such as exploring online fundraising ideas and participating in the annual Flying Pig Marathon in Cincinnati to raise funds., ASU Lab Research Assistant For one year as an undergraduate, I worked as a lab research assistant in an on-campus evolutionary biology lab at Arizona State University.  I prepared chemicals that were needed in the lab on a daily basis.  I was also assigned the task of obtaining samples from fish that the research group had collected from rivers and streams.  After obtaining tissues from the fish, I carried out additional procedures including PCR to extract and isolate DNA for further research and analysis in the lab.  I helped the lab formulate and design a database to store and organize research papers and articles that had been published by members of the lab or pulled from other sources to be used as reference.  This made a tremendous impact on efficiency in the lab because the information was more organized and accessible., Somerville Hospital Emergency Room Volunteer For six months, four hours per week, I worked as a volunteer in the emergency room at the Somerville Hospital, which primarily serves the surrounding disadvantaged minority population.  I shadowed physicians in the department, and being a small hospital, I was able to observe various procedures done in the emergency room.  Additional duties included assisting in preparations, helping coordinate communication between hospital personnel, and providing Mandarin Chinese to English translation services for patients when needed.  I had many opportunities to interact with patients and saw that each patient was a unique individual and each had a story to tell.  One day, a woman came in with a post-surgical infection in her knee.  As I was assisting with preparations, I began talking to her and realized that she immediately took to me.  The next thing I knew, I was holding her hand, talking to her about her son as tears streamed down her face through the procedure.  It was an incredibly painful procedure but somehow, I had made it just a little easier for her to bear.  Through this experience, I now realize the difference every small gesture can make for a suffering patient., ASU Asian Students Association Co-President I served as the co-president of the Asian Students Association at Arizona State University.  In this position, I played a key role in organizing fundraising events, holding weekly meetings, recruitment efforts, and addressing budgeting issues.  In conjunction with other Asian organizations on campus, we worked to bring various leaders in the Asian community to campus as panel speakers in hopes of raising Asian awareness in the campus community.  Panels and conferences addressed issues and challenges that Asians as a group faced as well as possible solutions and mechanisms to deal with certain situations, such as discrimination.  During my involvement with the Asian Students Association, I also served on the leadership panel of the Asian Student Coalition for one semester.  The Asian Student Coalition was an integration of all student-run Asian organizations on campus.  Through my involvement and interaction with the Asian Students Association and the Asian Coalition, I was able to contribute to increasing cultural awareness in the campus community through seminars, cultural performances, and multicultural fairs.  I learned that many times, extending a hand and reaching out to the community to inform and educate can elicit an incredibly positive, engaging, and receptive response from the audience., ASU Full Regents Music Scholarship I was awarded a full tuition music regents scholarship at Arizona State University through a competitive application and audition process.  At Arizona State University, I played violin in the university symphony orchestra as well as the university chamber orchestra., ASU Disabilities Resource Center Reader The Disability Resource Center at Arizona State University provided various resources for students with disabilities.  As a reader, I provided a variety of services for students with mental and/or physical disabilities including reading and recording textbooks onto tape, providing note-taking services, and proctoring exams.  The services provided through the Disability Resource Center allowed many students the capability to participate actively in their classes, which would be extremely difficult to accomplish otherwise."

    "text": "Walking into Bethesda North Hospital that November morning, I was nervous. It was my first opportunity to shadow a practicing physician, and my senses were in a state of heightened awareness. I knew I would see, hear and smell things that I had never experienced, and I was not sure how I would react. What would I see What would I smell Could I handle the blood Questions ran through my mind rapidly, and my answer came more quickly than expected.   I went to the locker room and put on a gown, mask and hair net. The man changing next to me was a nurse, and having Type I diabetes, was fitted with an insulin pump. He knew I was there to learn all I could, so he asked if I would like to watch him replace his catheter. I agreed, apprehensive that, under the stress of being in a new place and not knowing what to expect, I would not be able to handle the sight of the needle puncturing his skin. I was relieved when I watched closely without a hint of dizziness. I walked out and, after refusing the food offered to me in the lunch room (I didn't want anything in my stomach that could come up later), I was introduced to Dr. Labella, a general surgeon.   Dr. Labella was preparing to remove a lipoma from the back of a middle-aged man. He described the basics of the procedure; an anesthesiologist would put the man to sleep before injecting local anesthetic. The patient may wake up during the surgery, but that was perfectly fine. Great, I thought to myself, let's see what you can handle from the get-go, Evan. As I stood on a stool behind Dr. Labella, I watched as he drew a circle around the lipoma on the sleeping man's back and proceeded to make an incision of about three inches. The surgeon inserted his fingers into the incision to loosen the skin from the fatty tumor. Blood oozed from the incision as he poked around, and I was reassured that I didn't feel faint. When the patient awakened and began talking, my perspective changed. The more he spoke, the more human he became, and blood began to move from my head to my toes. A feeling of embarrassment closely followed as the doctor and nurses saw my face pale and asked me if I needed to have a seat. Knowing a fall would only bring more embarrassment, I gladly stepped down and sat in the chair behind me.   After a few minutes, I gathered myself, returned to my post and watched the surgeon complete the procedure.    Two hours later, I watched a woman have a procedure performed to her hand and her fingernail removed while she talked to me. Then, I ended the day observing two tonsil and adenoidectomies. That January, I shadowed a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon and was amazed as he opened the hip of a two year old to perform an osteotomy and reconfigure her hip joint.   I have prepared myself for a medical career in another way.  Through my service experiences at Xavier, especially my extensive involvement with Alternative Breaks, I have been challenged to understand and help others from backgrounds, cultures, races and situations that are exceptionally different from my own. From people with HIV/Aids in San Francisco to Ukrainian children that have been physically and mentally abused; from ex-prisoners in Chicago to children with disabilities; from Mexican immigrants to Katrina survivors in New Orleans, my perspectives and beliefs have changed as a result of the people I have met, and the desire to understand and serve others has become paramount in my life.  I have a deep desire to become a doctor; to free people from the medical maladies present in our world today, or at least provide them with a better quality of life.  When I decided to pursue a medical career, I had two apprehensions. First, would I be able to handle the sights, sounds and smells of a medical environment  Second, could I perform at the intellectual level required  Through my academic and shadowing experiences I have discovered that the answer to both of these questions is, yes.    Of course, medical school will present greater challenges and the academic load will require me to perform at an increasingly higher intellectual level.  Yet, I feel prepared and am eager to meet the challenges and excel in the medical environment.  Finally, my experiences with the Alternative Breaks program have convinced me that my proper place in this world is in the service of others.   I am driven to go to medical school because it gives me the chance to match my compassion for others with my love of biology and physiology, for the purpose of directly improving the quality of life of another person. I look forward to the day I can don the white coat and begin my lifetime of service. Alternative Breaks President Alternative Breaks is responsible for organizing 23 service-learning trips for over 250 students during spring and summer breaks. As President, I oversaw a 13-member student board responsible for planning, budgeting and fundraising for all of the trips, with an overall budget of $175,000.00. I planned and facilitated weekly board meetings where I assured that all deadlines were being met, we were within our budget and fundraising proceeded as forecasted. I acted as the liaison between students and administration, ensuring the safety of the trips, completion of all correct liability forms for each participant and execution of policies surrounding the program. I organized a new evaluation process to determine trip effectiveness and overall quality of the program. During the trips I helped coordinate crisis management to address any unforeseen and unavoidable issues that affected the trips. I also developed an end-of-year training retreat to ensure a smooth transition of leadership from year to year., Alternative Breaks Site Coordinator, ABC's San Diego As a site coordinator, I was responsible for planning four service trips over Spring Break. I coordinated food, housing, service work, and educational material for each group, all within a set budget. Weekly meetings were held with the Site Leaders of my trips to resolve any conflicts or challenges they faced. I also developed an off-campus weekend training retreat for 44 student Site Leaders, including an interactive agenda, and a method to evaluate the retreat's effectiveness.  I also served as a Site Leader at the national Alternative Breaks Conference in San Diego in July of 2007. For ten days, leaders of Alternative Breaks programs across the country met to discuss the makings of a quality Alternative Breaks program. In addition, all conference attendees participated in a service experience focused on the issue of immigration. We worked with local immigrant support agencies, met with local leaders and took a border tour in order to expand our knowledge and understanding of a very complex and polarizing issue., Clinical Shadowing - Bethesda North Hospital I had the opportunity to shadow Dr. Davore, an otolaryngologist and Dr. Labella, a general surgeon. I observed the removal of a lipoma from a patient's back, a hand surgery, and two tonsil and adenoidectomies. Through this experience I gained a better understanding of the daily routine of a physician, the challenges they face, and the procedures they perform. Between procedures, I talked with both doctors about their experiences as physicians. I discovered that they lead a mission trip to a medical clinic in Belize each year to treat the underprivileged. By watching the procedures I had the chance to experience a new medical environment and was reassured by my eventual comfort and curiosity during the shadowing., Clinical Shadowing - Cincinnati Children's Hospital I had the opportunity to shadow Dr. Tamai, a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, for two procedures. The first was a removal of screws from a patient's elbow that took about an hour. The second was a six hour procedure on a two-year-old girl that involved repairing her hip joint after infection had destroyed the cartilage.   Dr. Tamai performed an osteotomy and inserted a plate with 2 rods and screws. Another doctor on the team explained the procedure in detail as it occurred.  I was both amazed by the experience and reassured that I was comfortable in a surgery setting. I also had the opportunity to talk with Dr. Tamai between procedures about the challenges and rewards of being both a physician and a father., Alternative Breaks Participant - HIV/Aids - San Francisco I had the opportunity to take a trip to San Francisco with a group of students in order to educate ourselves on the issue of HIV/Aids and the people that it affects. We worked with three non-profit organizations that provide support services for people with HIV and spoke with a man who has been living with HIV for 20 years. It was eye-opening to see how much of an umbrella issue HIV/Aids is, bleeding into politics, stereotypes, and medicine. Controversy abounds as debate continues over the morality of condom distribution and needle exchange programs. Through our work we were able to begin to break some of our own stereotypes, gather some firsthand information on the controversial programs, and meet the disease in its most well-known domestic battleground., Volunteer - Children's Hospital - Bone Marrow Transplant I had the opportunity to volunteer in the Bone Marrow Transplant unit at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. My job was to entertain the children and play games with them in their rooms, which afforded their parents the opportunity to leave the room for a break.    I helped the nurses with small tasks while they administered medication and helped to keep the child's mind off the treatment. This experience was inspirational as well as educational. I was astounded by how happy and resilient the children were and impressed with the effort by Children's Hospital's staff to make recovery as bearable as possible for these children. I also became very comfortable in a medical environment with all of the monitoring equipment, tubes and medical apparatus around the children., Manresa Freshman Orientation I was one of two group leaders in charge of facilitating a group of first year students at Xavier. We conducted conversations about the transition from high school to college life, shared useful information and served as confidants to students who wished to share information or ask questions. The orientation program lasted three days, with three days of training before the new students arrived., Alternative Breaks Participant - New Orleans I was part of a group that worked in New Orleans for 2 weeks, a year after the destruction of Hurricane Katrina. We gutted four homes for elderly residents, and made some very strong connections with those families. We also educated ourselves on the issues surrounding the catastrophe and were involved in discussions with the residents about their situations, including the politics and issues surrounding New Orleans. We discussed the disaster and the surrounding problems amongst ourselves during self-facilitated reflections each night. We still contact one of the families and have sent care packages and letters to them in order to show our support and to thank them for their hospitality during our trip. This experience was the launching pad for my participation in service work and volunteer activities. It was one of the greatest experiences of my life., Approach Retreat Team I was part of a team that facilitated a weekend self-discovery and faith-searching retreat for students. I organized and performed a prayer service, led a small group and shared personal experiences that helped shape my beliefs. As a Christian retreat that involved participants and leaders from varying backgrounds and faiths, discussion was encouraged to discover how each of us could grow closer to God in our daily life. We discussed the fulfilling opportunities and challenges that a faith-life presents., Alpha Epsilon Delta (Premedical Honor Society) In recognition of my academic performance and dedication to service, I was inducted into Alpha Epsilon Delta.   As a member, I performed community service and attended regular meetings to organize fundraisers and other events., Carpenter - House Framing Summer Employment - Member of a framing crew constructing multi-story homes.  Developed skills including basic carpentry methods, construction math, blueprint reading, use of power tools, and coordination with other trades., UCCOM Mini-Med School The mini medical school presented an opportunity to learn firsthand about various disciplines in the medical field, direct from the Physicians and other professionals that practice them.  It was a program of discovery as disciplines and terminology I was unfamiliar with were discussed in detail.  The question and answer sessions were very helpful in expanding my knowledge of both general medical practices as well as details involved in many medical specialties. It was a great learning experience and reassured my interest in medicine as I found myself engaged and awed by the medical capabilities demonstrated in each presentation., Summer Service Internship - Camp Stepping Stones The Xavier Summer Service Internship places 20 students with various non-profit organizations around Cincinnati.   We lived on campus in community with one another and met every Wednesday to discuss our experiences.  I had the opportunity to work at Camp Stepping Stones, a summer day camp for children and adults with physical and mental disabilities.   As a floater, my job was to fill in for any of the 24 staff members that were absent on a given day.  As a result, I got to work with nearly every group and performed varied tasks such as creating activities, helping campers eat and leading groups.  The experience was as educational as it was fun.  I became very comfortable around people with disabilities and learned that many are far more able than I could ever have imagined., Alternative Breaks Participant - Chicago Volunteered at St. Leonard's, a halfway house for men who were recently released from prison. Their ages were 16 to 60 years old and their sentences had ranged from 6 months to 30 years. Daily projects included developing educational programs for the residents, helping with campus maintenance and engaging in conversation with the men. St. Leonard's is dedicated to decreasing recidivism rates and helping the men transition to a productive life in society by creating a supportive and empowering community. It was inspiring to see these men as people rather than inmates, and to hear their stories while witnessing their progress toward making better lifestyle choices each day., Alternative Breaks Participant - Ukraine Volunteered with a group in Kiev, Ukraine for ten days.  We stayed in an orphanage and performed various projects to help improve living conditions for the children.  We learned about the unique and tragic situations that many of these children are born into.  They came from the worst conditions I had ever heard of and suffered from learning disabilities, malnourishment and both physical and mental abuse. Many of the children had survived years of forced prostitution after being either sold or abandoned by their parents, yet in the environment of this revolutionary orphanage they were encouraged to learn, trust and play.  Their expressions of joy and happiness, despite the desperate conditions, were very inspiring. It was enlightening to see that such a severe issue is so unknown to the world. My eyes were opened to the reality that similar unknown tragedies must exist in the world over."

    "text": "Growing up, I did not know that I wanted to be a doctor. I did know that I enjoyed figuring out how things work, and that is why I initially chose mechanical engineering as my major.  I spent my first years of college surrounded by computers and robot projects, not living tissue and organ systems. I was complacent about my career choice until my junior year, when I realized I was not as happy as I wanted to be. I was doing well and would graduate on schedule, but none of this excited me.    From my internship experience in an industrial setting, I observed that people lose their drive and their ambition when they are not challenged by and emotionally invested in their work. I wanted to be more than just another number sitting behind a desk. That is when I began considering medicine as a field that would have more meaning and greater immediate impact on people's lives. I knew I was headed in the right direction when I took Biomechanics 687. This class combined the physics of mechanical engineering with the biology of muscles, bones, tendons, and other skeletal tissues.  My interest in the material made it one of the most enjoyable classes I have taken in college.   I began researching what my life would be like in medical school and as a doctor. One of my most reaffirming experiences has been working as a lab assistant in The Ohio State University's Injury Biomechanics Research Laboratory. I have had the unique opportunity, as an undergraduate student, to interact with post-mortem human subjects on a regular basis.  As a result of this firsthand exposure, I have a deep fascination and respect for human anatomy.  I continue to be surprised by how many new observations I make with every autopsy and dissection I assist with. My position in the lab also allowed me the opportunity to conduct and present a research project, which gave me a great appreciation for the time and effort researchers put forth to further our academic knowledge. These experiences, combined with the meaningful work I have observed while shadowing physicians, make it clear that medicine is the perfect way for me to stimulate my scientific curiosity while having the chance to do challenging work that directly improves someone's life.   Engineering changed how I go about solving problems that initially seem daunting or too complex to handle. Rather than giving in to frustration, I know to approach the problem methodically, thinking my way to a solution. My classes and research also influenced the specialty I would like to pursue in medical school. I am very interested in orthopedics as a result of observing several orthopedic surgeries and working closely with skeletal structures.  Orthopedics appeals to me because I enjoy concepts such as how forces influence bone growth and formation, which require the ability to understand both the physics and biology behind the human body. My background allows me to see the human body from both viewpoints and will be a valuable asset throughout my career. Thinking even farther into the future, I would like to become a surgeon, as I deeply enjoy the hands-on work I get to do for my job in the laboratory.  Choosing to pursue medical school at such a late stage in my undergraduate career presented many challenges for me, the greatest of which was adding prerequisite premed classes to my graduate-level engineering classes. This, combined with outside activities such as working part time, researching, tutoring, and volunteering, tested my ability to manage my time and energy effectively. I am proud of being able to balance all these responsibilities and know I will continue to do so in the future.  I also plan to make time during my senior year to take classes such as anatomy and a foreign language in order to become a more well-rounded person and stronger medical student.  Although the sciences have always been my strongest areas academically, I know I have other abilities that I want to utilize in my future career. Working in the medical field requires not only scientific knowledge, but also the ability to interact with patients and other professionals. I am fortunate to have grown up in a small, Midwestern town where I learned values that are indispensible when it comes to treating others with kindness and sincerity. After moving to Columbus, a place far more diverse than my hometown, I have realized how the basic values I was raised with make it possible to get along easily with anyone.  I would like to think my first four years of college are only one chapter of what will be a long, fulfilling academic experience. It took the greater portion of those years for me to find the answer to the question of what I wanted to do in life, but it was an answer worth finding. I am confident in my ability to succeed in medicine as a result of the challenges I placed upon myself during this time. Although my road to medical school was not the most direct, I am better for the obstacles I have overcome along the way. Academic Scholarships 2004-2008 -Ohio State Board of Regents Scholarship -OSU Maximus Competition - Medalist Scholarship -OSU Morrill Scholars Program - Prestige Scholarship -Robert C. Byrd Scholarship -Engineering Dean's Award  2008-2009 -McCracken-Haney Scholar -Pressman Scholarship, Student Athlete Tutor As a tutor for student-athletes, I met bi-weekly with students for one-hour sessions and tutored them in the area of general chemistry., Injury Biomechanics Symposium Research Presentation At the Injury Biomechanics Symposium I presented research I performed in the Injury Biomechanics Laboratory.  The presentation consisted of a Powerpoint presentation for the general audience, and a judged poster presentation.  Representatives from industry and academia were in attendence., Engineering Internship During the summer following my sophomore year, I worked for a private engineering firm as an intern in the engineering department.  The environment was a manufacturing facility, and my duties consisted of several projects working under the guidance of senior engineers.  Many of my assignments involved improving workspace functionality and efficiency for the workers at their stations.  Other assignments involved computerized drafting of new tooling and future floorplans for the factory.  I presented my work at weekly meetings with the other engineers and also at the end of my internship to the company's executive board., Hospital Volunteer I have served as a volunteer in the Emergency Department at the Ohio State University Hospital from June 2007 until present.  My role during this appointment has been to assist the hospital staff with patients and visitors in the registration and triage areas.  I have also had the chance to spend considerable time in the emergency department observing doctors and nurses as they administer care to patients.  During this experience I have observed many aspects of an emergency department both from a medical professional's standpoint and that of a patient or visitor., Denman Undergraduate Research Forum Poster Presentation The Denman Undergraduate Research Forum is a chance for undergraduate students to present the research they have conducted while at The Ohio State University.  I presented the project I conducted in the Injury Biomechanics Research Laboratory studying chin injury from blunt mandibular impact.  I presented my findings to judges, professors,  and members of the general public at the Denman forum., Laboratory Assistant The Injury Biomechanics Laboratory at Ohio State is a research laboratory in close collaboration with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and other government agencies involved in vehicle crash safety.  Through the use of post-mortem human subjects, the Injury Biomechanics Research Laboratory investigates human tolerance to injury in order to design more effective safety devices and vehicle designs.  I have worked in this laboratory for over a year as a general lab assistant.  In this capacity, I have had the opportunity to become involved in almost every aspect of a research environment.  I have done literature research for projects, maintained financial records, helped organize conference events, and maintained the overall order and functionality of the lab's resources. With respect to testing on post-mortem human subjects, I have had the privilege of having hands-on medical-related experience through dissecting and instrumenting subjects, participating in autopsies, observing CT scanners, fluoroscopes, and laproscopes in use, and seeing many other activities inherent in an anatomy oriented laboratory., Injury Biomechanics Symposium The Injury Biomechanics Symposium is a conference designed to bring together both students and experts in the field of injury biomechanics.  Injury biomechanics equates human injury with engineering measures in an effort to design safer automobiles and more effective safety devices.  The Symposium gives undegraduate and graduate students the opportunity to present their research projects and represent their respective institutions.  While attending this two day conference, I learned about the research projects of other students and listened to presentations and panel discussions by respected experts in the biomechanics field., Undergraduate Research Project While working at The Ohio State University Injury Biomechanics Research Laboratory under Dr. Bolte, I conducted a research project investigating the injury tolerance of the human chin to blunt mandibular impact.  I was involved in planning and executing the experiments on test days.  For this project I investigated existing literature and previous work that related to my project and also performed extensive analysis of the data collected from our experiments."

    "text": "Midway through my junior year of high school, a seemingly ordinary biology lecture on the human brain sparked a great passion in me that would lead to my ultimate decision to pursue a career in medicine.  I was completely captivated by the immense complexity with which a single neuron operates, how millions of tiny ionic channels function harmoniously to control an entire human being.  My fascination with the intricate processes involved in allowing people to see, think and breathe while performing all of the incredible feats that make humans unique created in me an unquenchable thirst to learn more.  I spent a substantial amount of time later that night exhausting all the resources that the textbook offered, and when that did not satisfy me, I began searching for opportunities that would make what I learned in this lecture come alive and help me understand why this particular lecture had excited me unlike any other. Six months later, I found what I was looking for.  I spent three days shadowing a neurosurgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, observing both his interactions with patients during his clinical hours and also scrubbing in for four open-brain surgeries.  My initial interest in the brain deepened tremendously during these surgeries, as I saw for the first time a live human brain, Dr. Bingaman describing to me its elaborate anatomical features and the surgical processes involved in transforming a malfunctioning brain into a fully capable human control center.  When he handed me the tumor jeopardizing one of his patient's futures, I saw firsthand the enormous power of medicine and knew that through this profession I could accomplish truly incredible things.  The more I explored the brain's complexities, the more I realized that even the smallest brain abnormality could severely impair an individual's quality of life.  I felt a strong desire to do something about such devastating problems and to make a difference in the lives of those who suffer everyday from the debilitating effects of disease.  At that moment, my passion for the science of medicine merged with my heart for helping those in need, and I knew that I wanted to devote the rest of my life to the practice of medicine. \tEager to embark upon my journey to becoming a doctor, I entered college continuously searching for chances to become involved in the healthcare field and help others.  During my third year of college, I found an opportunity into which I could really pour my heart: I volunteered as the research assistant of a study aimed at improving the communication between women undergoing chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer and their physicians through the innovative use of a personal digital assistant.  My role, to recruit patients and track their progress through treatment, allowed me substantial interaction with these women, and I devoted a considerable amount of time truly getting to know each individual.  I felt an incredible sense of satisfaction knowing that my efforts brought a personal touch to an often somber atmosphere, and many women thanked me for giving them both a friendly face and someone with whom to share their struggles through this especially trying time in their lives.  Additionally, I began to understand the limitations of medicine for the first time, as I watched everyday the misery that these brave women endured in order to escape the disease threatening to overtake their lives: their hair falling out, their constant fatigue, and the terror in their voices as they knowingly submitted to another week of treatments which would cause them agonizing pain and depression.  The many hours that I spent understanding what each woman was going through and reassuring her that she is not alone in her battle are invaluable, for they have fostered in me an overwhelming passion to become part of the force that will eliminate such suffering, both from the treatment of the disease and the disease itself.  \tReflecting upon the experiences that have shaped me in the past, I never could have imagined that my initial fascination with the human brain would have opened so many doors for me.  My first encounter with the brain will always be memorable; however, my recent experience in oncology has revealed to me the endless opportunities that await me in the medical field.  I know that in medicine I will never run out of new possibilities to explore and new challenges to push me beyond my limit.  I long for patients of my own, to help them overcome the struggles of their illnesses and to experience the same sense of satisfaction that Dr. Bingaman gained by helping his patients attain happier and more gratifying lives.  Not only is medicine the cornerstone of my heart, but I am confident that it is also my true calling, my one opportunity to leave a mark on the world so that when I am gone, even though people may not remember who I was, they will at least remember what I did for them. Freshman Resource Advisor As a Freshmen Resource Advisor, I was one of a select group of upperclassmen chosen to serve as an advisor to a group of approximately twenty incoming freshmen in order to help ease their transition to college life.  Some typical duties included introducing students to various campus resources, giving advice to help prepare them for the rigor of college academics, and coordinating a variety of meetings and social events throughout the semester.  In addition to fulfilling these basic obligations of my position, I was able to serve as both a role model and friend, encouraging students to get involved on campus by openly discussing the pleasure I received from participating in the vast array of opportunities available on campus.  I also provided a listening ear to those incoming students having a difficult time adjusting to college life and made practical suggestions for resolving any problems they were facing.  Through this experience I was able to strengthen and develop my leadership skills, learning that the best leaders are those who can take initiative while maintaining an air of grace and humility, winning the trust of those around them and inspiring them to push on towards the goal ahead, approaching any obstacles with both courage and perseverance., Alpha Epsilon Delta Member As a pre-medical student and also having recently transferred to OSU, the Alpha Epsilon Delta pre-medical honor society offered me a way to learn more about what it takes to pursue a career in the medical field while also meeting new people with interests similar to my own.  This organization holds weekly meetings, each week alternating between a general meeting in which a speaker from the medical community tells us about his or her journey to becoming a doctor and an ethics discussion in which an academic professional leads group members in a discussion about some of the important ethical issues surrounding medicine.  In addition, the group coordinates opportunities for community service, including chances to volunteer at the Physicians' Free Clinic and Children's Hospital, and holds various social events for members throughout each quarter.  Not only has my involvement in this organization helped me to develop my pre-professional health education, but I have greatly enjoyed participating in several of the service opportunities, so much so that I recently applied for and was elected to the position of Service Co-Director for the 2008-2009 academic year.  Through this position, I look forward to helping each individual obtain the resources necessary to one day become a successful health professional., Undergraduate Assistant Because I received a grade of A in my freshmen Introductory Biology course, the Biology department invited me during the Fall quarter of my sophomore year to assist a graduate student in leading an Introductory Biology laboratory for incoming freshmen.  Each week I prepared for and attended the laboratory section to which I was assigned, helping students understand Biology concepts, assisting in the completion of laboratory exercises, answering questions, and holding office hours for guidance in writing laboratory papers.  I was also extended the opportunity to teach one of the laboratory exercises myself and was encouraged by the ease with which I was able to communicate the material to the students.  As a peer and because I was always willing to help in any way that I could, I immediately earned the respect of each student, and as a result many felt comfortable asking me for assistance with any problem they were having both inside the classroom and out.  I was given many chances to share the keys to my success and took great pride in knowing that I played a small part in the successful completion of some students' first semester of college, a memorable experience that would set the tone for the remainder of their college careers., WOW Volunteer Having greatly enjoyed my experience participating in the Wizards program at Boston University, I began looking for a similar organization at Ohio State, finally finding Wonders of our World, or WOW, at the beginning of my junior year.  Like Wizards, WOW aims to supplement the poorly funded science programs in public schools around Columbus by conducting monthly science experiments, each month focusing on a different topic.  As I volunteer, my role involved attending a preparation meeting at the beginning of each month to practice the experiments and then traveling to one or more schools throughout the interval to conduct the experiments with the students.  Because as I am a science major, I greatly enjoyed watching the students become excited about science, eagerly offering to participate in the experiments and asking meaningful questions about the subject matter.  Helping the students share in my fascination with science and show an interest in learning more never fails to give me a sense of fulfillment., Honduras Service-Learning Program Helping others has always been a top priority in my life, and I strongly believe that participating in acts of service is crucial to gaining adequate preparation for the real world.  I applied for an OSU short-term study abroad program in Honduras both for the opportunity to help others and to travel internationally to a place where I could interact with people whose unique perspective of the world has the power to change mine.  I completed a service-learning course in the Spring quarter of my junior year in which I learned about ways to promote community development and to overcome some of the major problems facing third world countries today.  Subsequently, I will travel to Honduras in September of this year to apply the information gained in class to a real community in desperate need of rebuilding after the devastating hurricane that ensued in October of 1998.  During my twelve day stay, I will participate in projects aimed at developing the community by learning more about the community itself and assessing its needs, eventually passing the information on to future service groups.  Additionally, we will have the opportunity to interact on a daily basis with the children living at the HIV/AIDS orphanage at which we will be staying, hoping simply to make them laugh and brighten their day., Hospital Volunteer I began volunteering at the Ohio State University Medical Center during the Spring quarter of my sophomore year in order to gain a better understanding of the medical environment and interact more with patients.  For my first assignment, I was placed in the Mail and Flower Room, where I sorted and delivered mail and flowers to patients.  I thoroughly enjoyed this experience, for I was often the bright spot in each patient's day, bringing good news of supportive friends and family who were thinking of them during their stay.  I entered each room with a kindness that made each patient unable to resist smiling back at me.  I was placed in the Labor and Delivery Room the following year, where I acted as a liaison between patients' guest and the medical staff, performed various administrative tasks, and helped transport patients between rooms.  This assignment was also very pleasing to me, for I was often privileged to share in the thrill of welcoming a new life into the world, keeping anxious guests updated on the status of their loved one and celebrating with them at news of a safe and healthy baby.  This experience has shown me the joy of giving, and nothing compares to the personal satisfaction I receive from knowing that I have done something to help someone each time I volunteer., Dean's List I received this honor for successfully completing a minimum of 12 graded credit hours at the Ohio State University while maintaining a point-hour ratio of 3.5 or higher for the Winter 2007 quarter.  This achievement was repeated for the Spring 2007, Autumn 2007, Winter 2008, and Spring 2008 quarters as well.  Although I have been awarded this mark of distinction six times so far throughout my college career, each time I feel a great sense of pride and accomplishment, for it reflects my strong work ethic and the countless hours that I devote to succeeding at each academic endeavor upon which I embark.  I am never satisfied with my performance unless I know that I have put forth my absolute best efforts, and repeatedly making the Dean's List demonstrates that I have consistently given nothing less than one hundred percent to the exceedingly rigorous demands of college academics., Research Assistant Looking to broaden my experiences in the medical field by becoming involved in the research process, I began volunteering with the Department of Family Medicine at the beginning of my junior year.  Each weekday morning of the Fall quarter, I traveled to various family practice clinics around Columbus recruiting patients to take a telephone survey that would assess the effectiveness of an online course in which their physician had participated detailing a new three-step method to detect skin cancer.  When recruitment for this study ended in December, I was offered the opportunity to serve as the research assistant for an NCI-sponsored pilot study that would test the use of a personal digital assistant in improving communication between women undergoing chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer and their physicians regarding their pain, fatigue, and depression.  As the face of this study, I was responsible for both recruiting patients and following-up with them throughout their treatment.  Not only did I learn more about the research process and strengthen my interpersonal skills, but I also realized the importance of practicing humanistic medicine, seeing how the smallest effort to bring a personal touch to the medical environment can greatly improve a patient's healing and overall outlook on life., Capital City Half-Marathon Finisher Running has been an integral part of who I am for many years now.  I ran cross-country and track throughout middle school and high school and, although I never possessed much raw talent in either sport, my experiences running have been extremely important to developing the mental toughness and perseverance that I have today.  I knew I would never be a world-class athlete; yet my unfailing determination to succeed eventually helped me to become an important asset to my team.  I started college looking to set a goal that would help me continue to improve my abilities; as a result, I started training to complete a full marathon before graduation, an unfathomable distance at that time.  The Capital City half-marathon was a step in my training to reach this goal, and I take great pride in knowing that I endured the countless number of miles required to finish a race of this caliber.  It gives me a great deal of confidence as I approach my ultimate goal of completing a full marathon, set for October of this year.  I know that when I finally cross that finish line, I will experience a sense of pride and personal satisfaction unlike any before.  I will approach the future with confidence knowing that I can do anything I put my mind to., Wizards The Boston University Community Service Center acts as a resource to undergraduate students interested in volunteering both around campus and in the greater Boston area.  It consists of several individual divisions, each one devoted to a particular underserved group or cause.  The branch in which I was involved, called Wizards, sends groups of students to inner-city public school classrooms around Boston to conduct weekly science experiments in an effort to improve the declining science scores on standardized tests and to heighten students' interest in science.  My role as a group member for both the Spring 2006 and Fall 2006 semesters took me to several elementary school classrooms where I helped design and conduct experiments on anything from density to the food chain to volcanoes.  Not only did this experience give me the opportunity to teach science, but it also placed me in a position to act as a role model to young students, demonstrating to them through my own enthusiasm that education is the window capable of providing people with the resources necessary to achieve their dreams.  I learned that spending even a few hours each week taking an active interest in a child's life can produce lasting results on his self-esteem and motivation, inspiring him to reach high and never give up., Jerome Schottenstein Center Guest Services Attendant The Ohio State University Jerome Schottenstein Center consistently ranks as one of the top event arenas of all those at public universities across the nation.  As a guest services attendant, my main responsibility involved ensuring the safety of guests who attended the events held there, including concerts, sporting events, and graduations.  I performed a variety of duties over the past year, such as taking guests' tickets at the entrance, checking bags, ushering guests to their seats and monitoring their behavior during the event, and answering any questions they may have.  Not only has this job allowed me to become more financially independent, but I have also gained an appreciation for the great deal of pride that OSU students have for their school.  Their spirit for OSU athletics is contagious, and I am always amazed at the enthusiasm that they bring to the OSU basketball games.  This experience has led me to meet some great people who have similar interests as mine, encouraging me to get more involved on campus while allowing me to have fun at the same time.  I plan to continue my employment for the coming academic year as well."

    "text": "Becoming a person with exceptional morals and a drive to achieve goals wasn't an easy task for me due to the negative influences and overwhelming emotional strain caused by my home life. From a very young age, I knew my mother was an alcoholic even if I was not yet able to put a word to her actions. After my parents divorced, my mother returned to being an exotic dancer to provide an income, and she would repeated expose herself to alcohol, drugs, and prostitution. My grandmother convinced her to enlist in the Navy. Everything seemed fine until one morning I woke up and found her and a man I didn't know laying naked on the living room floor, an empty liquor bottle on the coffee table. At this time I was only seven years old. Once her service contract was up, she didn't re-enlist and we moved back to Ohio to take care of my ailing grandfather. When I was in third grade, we had an apartment and my bedroom was technically the dining room, with all of the other rooms branching off of it. My mother and some of her friends were drinking in the kitchen and she became upset. She grabbed a knife, crawled into the bathtub, and was threatening to kill herself. Her friends took her to the hospital and a social worker visited me at school concerning the incident. After this, she decided to join the Army to get government funding for a college education, which she hadn't utilized after leaving the Navy. She was almost through with her entire term, but was discharged early. We again moved back to Ohio to take care of my grandfather. After his death, we lived in a small pull-behind trailer that was situated on his property. It had one bed, a bathroom with a curtain as the door, and a combined living room, kitchen, and dining room for my mother, my infant sister, and I to share. We upgraded to a single-wide trailer and I had my own room. One evening, I ran away because my mother beat my legs with an extension cord and a school official saw the U-shaped marks during gym class. I moved in with my dad for a year and when I returned it was time for high school. During this time, my mother and I clashed heads again, and I was really starting to feel emotionally drained. She started a fist fight with me by trying to punch me in the face. I defended myself and was punished more severely by being grounded as well as spanked. When it was time to graduate high school and apply for college, I applied to schools as far away as possible. I moved to Georgia for college and our relationship seemed to get better. Little did I know that it was all a facade. I moved home after my sophomore year of college at Oxford and started attending Kent State University -- Tuscarawas Campus while living at home. One day a box came with my name on it. I hadn't been expecting anything, so I opened it and inside was a pair of boots, size seven. I wear a size ten. I looked at the receipt and they were $700. My mother had bought these boots, but why was my name on them I thought nothing of it, until a few weeks later I saw in the mail a credit card statement from CitiBank, also with my name on it. I hadn't ever had a credit card in my life, so I opened it up and it was charged to the limit, which was over $10,000. I called my father and asked him for advice. My mother was stealing my identity and ruining my credit which wouldn't allow me to get school loans without a co-signer. I moved out of my mother's house and to the city of Kent into an apartment. I had my mail forwarded to me, only to find another two credit cards statements arrive at my house. I called the companies, started fraud reports, and filed reports with the police. All of the while not speaking to my mother. I did not speak with my mother for two years while the fraud was being investigated. She told the police I allowed her to open the cards and spend the money. So all I could do per the authorities was sue her for any money I had to pay out to the companies, which was none. So throughout all of this, my mother never was remorseful for what she had done, at least not sincerely.  I definitely struggled to figure out where I was to find positive role models, people whom I could look up to and how to create my own definitions of the correct way to live and the wrong way. A lot of times, I had to decide for myself a proper course of action in a situation, with what broken semblance of an idea that I had been given. I had an abundance of ideas on how to not be or act, and I could manage to pass on to my younger sister the ability to make decisions for herself. I have never been in trouble with the law, have never stolen anything, and have created my own goals to which I aspire. I want to be a doctor, I have the sufficient scientific background, the drive, and the extreme interest in pulling myself up and out of the life in which I was raised. Hospice of Summa Volunteer I volunteer with Hospice of Summa hand making bereavement cards that are sent to family members one year after the patient's death. I also have performed several floral deliveries on patient's birthdays and provide respite care for one patient in her home while her caregiver goes to work and runs errands. We have also had hours of training, including comfort touch which is a special massage specifically designed for the ailing and elderly. I enjoy this immensely and if I go to medical school near Akron, I will continue to volunteer. The staff are great and all of the patients I have met so far are pleasant., Independence I work with mentally handicapped and developmentally disabled adults. Currently I work with a set of community clients, which are mildly mentally handicapped patients whom live on their own and only receive care a few times a week to go on outings, to the doctor, grocery shopping, and to help with chores around the house. I also work with a supported living home, where the patients work, pay their own bills, and also socialize. I assist with cleaning, shopping, and transportation to events. I administer medications, both oral and topical, and for some of our patients I monitor blood pressures and blood sugar., Neuroscience Individual Investigation I worked in a lab under an undergraduate Neuroscience professor. We did research on laboratory rats, following a depression model for humans. My part in the research was two-fold. When we began, we handled the rats and stressed them in decapi-cones, then decapitated them, dissected the corresponding brain regions and body organs, collected weight data, and ran analyzes to detect stress hormones (catecholamines, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, etc). The second part of my research was that I was given a project to carry out in the long-term depression model. I stressed the rats every day for 28 days, 2 hours a day. I then weighed the rats once a week, gave them a 1% sucrose mix versus water to see if they would have increased or decreased interest in sweets, and also had a novel experiment involving a younger male mouse where I would time the amount of interaction where the test mouse would interact with the baby. I wrote up a report and presented it to the my lab coworkers and reported to my professor often with questions and for tips on how to proceed throughout my research project.,  MRDD Home Health Aide, Internship- Academic Associate My internship was located in the Emergency Department of Akron Children's Hospital. I was a research associate whom monitored the incoming patients' board for medical conditions which coincided with research that was being done, such as abscesses and asthma. I was trained how to approach patients and their families to receive consent to them to participate in our studies. The entire team of associates was also tested and certified for research on human subjects and learned the history of the hospital and the ethic involved in enrolling patients in studies., Phi Delta Epsilon - Pre-Medical Fraternity Phi Delta Epsilon was a pre-medical co-ed fraternity that participated in multiple events while I was a member. We participated in Relay for Life two times, with a board games tent for participants whom were taking a break from walking, we have a fund-raising barbecue to raise money for Children's Miracle network, and also to raise money for Children's Miracle Network, we sold balloons at two college events, one of them being Kent's Black Squirrel Festival.,  QC Lab Technician, Supplemental Instructor Supplemental Instruction is in place for freshman and sophomore level classes which are historically difficult, meaning that 40% of the students with get a D, an F, or will withdraw from the class. Our goal was to help students learn what to study and how to study for these large classes in which the teacher couldn't give much individual attention. I attended classes with the students the entire semester and kept up with lecture notes, quiz dates, and exam schedules. I then held between 3-5 study sessions a week to review the material with the students and help them understand any difficult concepts. Also office hours were held so that individuals could come in with specific problems for a more one on one approach. All the leaders were trained the weekend before school began for a semester and attended bi-weekly meetings to refresh our skill set. This was my most favorite job and I am sad that I left! I met a lot of promising young students and, Amnesty International When I started Amnesty International we had a Christmas drive for the only battered woman's shelter in Portage county where we decorated boxes, asked local business to host the boxes in their stores, and asked for donations of common household items and toys. We are also going to have an open mic event this upcoming fall to promote awareness for domestic violence. Also we are starting a Kick Coke Off Campus campaign this fall."

    "text": "In the seventh grade, I lost my grandfather to Parkinson's Disease. This is why, when my organic chemistry professor in college lectured one day on The Parkinson's Institute (TPI), a place of both research and patient care, I sat up attentively. I read further about the way in which the discovery of a single molecule resulted in unforeseen breakthroughs in Parkinson's research. I wanted to be part of such a scientific team, and I spent the following summer (after my second year in college) as a research intern at TPI. Under Dr. Amy Manning-Bog, I studied the effects of paraquat exposure on DJ-1, a protein recently implicated in Parkinson's Disease. This internship was my first training in how to stay abreast of scientific literature, and gave me a fundamental understanding of how to carry out an experiment. I solidified laboratory techniques such as western blotting. As much as I liked the bench work, however, there was something missing: the human component. I periodically snuck down to the patient care area to watch the head physicians at work. There, I learned about the typical patterns of shuffles and gaits that patients exhibit, and that there is no biochemical assay for diagnosis of the disease.  When I returned to Penn State University as a junior, and joined Dr. Anne Andrews' neuroscience laboratory to study the genetic basis of anxiety disorders. I learned how to conduct behavioral tests in mouse models, and how phenotypic patterns can be used to find the genes underlying a disorder. I also learned how to think critically, owing largely to group meetings in which we posed difficult questions to each other. I presented my work at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting in 2008, and there grew enamored with the innovative research that I saw around me. At the conference, I continued to be drawn to the special lectures given by physicians on patient cases and care. It was not until my friend asked me pointedly, you are applying to graduate school, right that I realized that I was not at peace with the idea. I saw research in my future, but I saw it meshed with my desire to treat and care for patients.  Throughout high school, I volunteered at Centre Volunteers in Medicine, a clinic that offers medical care for uninsured individuals. As a data entry assistant, I compiled patient files into a computerized filing system. I became aware of confidentiality laws and how to respect the wishes of the patients we treat. Currently, I am a volunteer in the Emergency Department of our local hospital. My duties include communicating to the nurses and doctors any change in health status of the patients, taking patients to various areas of the hospital for tests, making beds between patients, etc. My greatest pleasure is in making rounds to speak to each patient and their family, offering reassurance. The doctors kindly explain to me laboratory and clinical data used in the diagnosis of a patient. In the hospital this year, I finally felt what I hadn't felt in all my years of sole bench work. A quote by Lao Tzu comes to mind: At the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are and you know what you want. I want to be a doctor.  Until my internship at The Parkinson's Institute, I had been exploring a career in veterinary medicine, a field that combined my passion for medicine with my love for animals. My coursework has taught me the importance of public health: animals and humans are intertwined in disease occurrence as well as medical advances. This was emphasized to me during one summer in high school when I assisted in epidemiological research in Dr. Jayarao Bhushan's laboratory at Penn State. During this experience, I participated in outreach trips to local Pennsylvania farms as well as in laboratory experimental setup. I have also learned of the economic implications of animal care: working at Hebbal Veterinary Hospital in Bangalore, India opened my eyes to the true life of the Indian farmer, in a one-animal-per-family model. After several more veterinary experiences in college, however, I realized that I had been mistaking my love for animals for the desire to become a veterinarian. As my interest in human medicine grew, I realized where my true passion lies.   In college, I have enjoyed learning how to lead my fellow students to help achieve collaborative goals. This past year, I served as President of the Penn State Biomedical Sciences Club. Our club was founded to increase interest in basic and clinical research, as well as in science policy. Our members took part in extension science workshops, attended conferences together, spoke at involvement fairs, and hosted networking mixers for incoming students. I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with such a committed group of students.    In today's medicine, the distance between the bench and the bedside is small. Good patient care involves compassion and bringing the latest advances to the patient. With a medical school education, and continued reading and learning, I hope to become a good physician, one who adheres to both quality patient care and solid research. Emergency Department Volunteer As a volunteer in the Emergency Department, I am responsible for assisting staff in receiving patients, obtaining information, making up litters, transporting medicines, and communicating with patients' families regarding patients' status., Intern at the Hebbal Veterinary Hospital in Bangalore, India At Hebbal Veterinary Hospital, I worked closely with Dr. Yathiraj observing a variety of small and large animal cases in the clinic and in surgery. I gained exposure to both the people and animals of rural India as I traveled with veterinarians on extension trips. Hebbal is a teaching hospital, and I gained my first exposure to the academic dedication of students that is required in any medical field., Research Intern, The Parkinson's Institute At The Parkinson's Institute, I worked with Dr. Amy Manning-Bog of the basic research department on the effects of Paraquat exposure on DJ-1 expression in the brain (DJ-1 is a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease). I gained extensive experience conducting SDS-PAGE technique, and troubleshooting western blots. By the end of my internship, I had confirmed the use of an appropriate antibody in the protein separation of DJ-1 in brain tissue. \tThe Institute has a basic research department, a clinical research department, as well as a clinic. As such, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the interconnectivity of basic research, public health and awareness, and patient care. I also attended seminars and meetings., Centre Volunteers in Medicine- Medical Data Entry Assistant Centre Volunteers in Medicine (CVIM) is a non-profit clinic that strives to provide healthcare to uninsured individuals in Centre County, PA. As a medical data entry assistant, I was responsible for entering written medical information and patient files into CVIM's computer system., Animal Medical Hospital (AAHA Member) Volunteer During my year at The Animal Medical Hospital (AMH), I worked closely with one of four joint-practice veterinarians, Dr. Karen Jones. Under her guidance, I observed a variety of cases encompassing anesthesia, surgery, dentistry, oncology, radiology and emergency care.  \tI learned what it is like to work in a joint practice, and to be able to seek counsel from colleagues when attending to patients., Veterinary Summer Enrichment Program At Michigan State Univ. I participated in the Vetward Bound summer enrichment program at the MSU College of Veterinary Medicine during my freshman year in college, at which time I was pursuing veterinary medicine. At MSU, I took rigorous six-week reinforcement classes in mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics and animal science. Students were given epidemiological case studies to solve in groups. The pathogenesis and prognosis of each case was then presented to faculty and staff of the College of Veterinary Medicine.  \tAdditionally, I had the opportunity to conduct a rectal palpation and to draw blood from a dairy cow under supervision of a veterinarian. As part of the program, we had extensive tours of the MSU dairy, swine, and sheep farms. I volunteered in the emergency ward of the teaching hospital. \tFinally, professional development workshops were offered., Classical Piano I studied classical piano from the fifth grade to my senior year in high school with my teacher, Mrs. Koya Ohmoto.  Under her guidance, I reached state finals in the Piano Music Teachers' Association (PMTA) annual music festival in 1999 and 2000. During my senior year in high school,  my fellow pianist and I held our own senior recital, in which we played an array of solo pieces and duets. Upon entering my freshman year in college, I continued my lessons with Dr. Marylene Dosse, Distinguished Professor of Music at Penn State. Although I discontinued my formal training during my sophomore year in college due to the time constraints of other commitments, I still very much enjoy playing as my hobby. Some of my favorite composers include Johannes Brahms and Aaron Copland., Relay for Life Participant I was a participant in Relay for Life twice: in 2006 and 2007. I walked with my team for 24 hours to help raise money for Cancer research. Together, the organization raised over $80,000 in 2007., Bicycling In the past few years, I have picked up cycling as a personal hobby. My friends and I enjoy both road and mountain trails on the Pennsylvania back roads; we sometimes do fifteen to twenty mile rides on weekends. My most favorite trip has been biking the Stanford dish with my Uncle in Palo Alto, CA., Undergraduate Researcher Position, The Andrews Laboratory The Andrews laboratory concentrates on the serotonin neurotransmitter system and its role in the behavior, etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders. In the past year, I have worked on two specific projects. \tOne study entails using behavior tests to phenotype recombinant inbred mice, and to ultimately use these data for the mapping of anxiety-related genes. I have conducted the behavior testing, and have completed the literature searches and pilot work necessary for the incorporation of a new test in our study. I presented our work at a the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting, 2008.  \tMy second study aims to determine the role of serotonin in learning and memory using the molecule 2'-NH2-MPTP.  \tAdditionally, I attended weekly group meetings where our experiments were discussed with colleagues, and received a $1500 undergraduate research grant from the PSU College of Agricultural Sciences toward my research., President, The Penn State Biomedical Sciences Club The Penn State Biomedical Sciences Club was founded to foster an appreciation for the diversity of careers in the biomedical sciences, and to assist students in their professional development. At our meetings, we host speakers from all scientific disciplines, including basic and clinical researchers, physicians, veterinarians, professors, and professional development experts. Our club members (fifty active) also participate in outreach programs, such as strawberry DNA isolation experiments for students in 6th through 10th grades, on various career exploration days. \tAs our club's umbrella college is the College of Agriculture, our club members show a consistent presence in the Agriculture Student Council, as well as college fundraisers, such as Ag Hill Olympics. As the president of the club, I coordinated and presided over all general body meetings and executive committee meetings., Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. The Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting is a five-day convention that gathers over 30,000 neuroscientists from all over the world.  \tI presented a poster entitled Strain 11 BxD recombinant inbred mice display a complex phenotype characterized by increased anxiety-related behavior and hypolocomotion compared to strain 31. This study entails using recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains to characterize phenotypic differences in anxiety-related behavior. The ultimate goal is to use Quantitative Trait Loci mapping to pinpoint the chromosomal regions containing anxiety-related genes.   \tI have conducted all the behavior tests (including open field locomotion and the elevated plus maze) necessary for data collection. In addition, I have researched and piloted an additional behavior test (novelty-induced hypophagia) to incorporate in our paradigms., Symposium for Women in Science (SWIS) The Symposium for Women in Science (SWIS) is designed for undergraduate female students interested in pursuing a career in the sciences. The keynote speaker for this event was Dr. Patrice Desvigne-Nickens, leader of the Cardiovascular Medicine Scientific Research Group at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)., Women in Science and Engineering Research (WISER) position The WISE Institute at Penn State endeavors to promote women within the disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. During this one-year research experience funded by WISE, I measured colostrum quality of the dairy cow using the principles of specific gravity. It was noted that many dairy farmers do not use conventional glass hydrometers to measure colostrum quality on the farm out of the concern that they break easily. I compared the accuracy of using a new plastic hydrometer compared to the glass one., Summer Research Experience, Dr. Jayarao's Laboratory This was my first research experience as a high school student. In Dr. Jayarao's laboratory, I assisted an honors Penn State student as she completed her undergraduate thesis in oral equine pathology. Additionally, I had the opportunity to accompany laboratory members on extension trips to local farms and assist in sample collection. \tIn college, Dr. Jayarao remained one of my most inspiring and charismatic professors. I have taken his 400-level Epidemiology in Infectious Disease course, in which Dr. Jayarao presented us with complex case studies which we had to solve using CDC software. I have learned from him substantially the role of public health in our society."

    "text": "A sweep of crimson red and a stroke of azure blue blend into harmonious violet. A swish of white adds a highlight; black shadows add depth. Life is like creating a painting. I start with a blank canvas and a vision, but I don't know how it will turn out until it's done. I start building my composition, laying down a base coat. At times I take inspiration from another artist.  One of the people that inspire me most is my father. He immigrated to America at age six without knowing any English. Through hard work and determination, he overcame cultural barriers, eventually graduating from pharmacy school. As a child I remember hearing the door creak open and seeing my dad in his crisp, white jacket after a long day at work.  At that age, the white jacket didn't have much significance, except that my dad was home to play with my sister and me.  As I got older I learned that the white jacket meant that my dad was a person in a health profession, a person who is trusted. My father inspired my interest in medical science and is partly why I hold health professions in such high esteem. This is my base coat.  From there, I continue to develop my painting.  I layer stroke by stroke. Figures begin to emerge.  Sometimes things don't turn out as I expect.  I can let it dry and repaint it.  Though it will always be a part of the painting, I can learn from it and move on.  For a while I wanted to be a pharmacist like my dad. I shadowed a pharmacist in high school, but something was missing for me, perhaps an element of challenge. I had to find my own path.  If my current approach isn't working, I try new strokes and colors. The painting progresses.  Though I decided not to follow directly in the footsteps of my dad, I used the foundation of values from my childhood to guide me in new paths. I pursued my interest in science. I have researched in two laboratories where I gained a deeper knowledge of science and was provoked to ask more questions. I also learned to be resourceful and independent as I went about diagnosing problems in my experiments. When I was working in Dr. Buchholz's lab, my first project didn't work. I reviewed the literature, and proposed that our project was missing a component. Dr. Buchholz agreed, resulting in a new branch to my research.  Although I enjoyed the intellectual demands of lab life, three summers of full-time lab experience made me realize that I missed working with people.  I stayed connected to my community through various endeavors including visits to retirement homes, neighborhood clean-up projects, and tutoring at local schools. Last spring, I volunteered at a pediatric clinic as a Spanish translator. Here I witnessed the miraculous feats of medicine. We once had a two year old wheeled in on a stroller. In addition to the usual cargo of food, diapers, and wipes there was a breathing machine.  When the pediatrician placed the little boy on the examination table, I saw that he also had a tube protruding from his gut. I was amazed that despite all of this he still had the cutest smile on his face, a smile made possible by a physician.  My clinical experience also opened my eyes to some of the challenges in health care. Most of our patients were on Medicare. When writing prescriptions, the physicians always considered cost, knowing that not all the families could afford the best medication. I also saw challenges in cultural differences. Though most of the staff at my clinic spoke both English and Spanish, the associated dental office had no bilingual staff. The nurses at my clinic went above the call of duty, orally translating dental forms for our patients. One of the nurses actually hugged me when I came in with the six pages of forms completely translated into Spanish. Though we were well equipped to handle Spanish-speaking patients, we had families from other cultures whose languages we were not equipped to handle. These are issues that can be worked on. As an artist, I am in constant pursuit of ways to improve my painting. As a physician I intend to be in constant pursuit of ways to improve health care.  Painting requires passion, patience, and sincerity to achieve the final vision.  In fact, success in just about any field requires these three elements. The key is to find the field that you love. The rest ought to fall in place. This idea has been my base as I pursued activities that I care about, and it seems to have worked thus far. Both labs where I interned in the summer offered me a paid position during the school year. In one lab, I was given the responsibility of mentoring a younger student in his first research experience. In another example, I was the first resident to sign up to live in the Center for Community Engagement House (a service themed residence hall). In my first year, I devoted much of my time and effort to an after-school program because I believed in it. The staff at the Center for Community Engagement recognized my effort and asked me to be the leader of the House the following year. However, all that I have mentioned is only part of my final vision, a vision of an outstanding physician who has strong work ethic, compassion, and determination. I just need you to have faith in my vision so that I can complete my masterpiece. Teaching Assistant As a teaching assistant for Honors Freshman Chemistry, I graded homework problems for the lecture portion of the class and notebooks for the lab portion of the class. I also attended lab to help supervise students and answer any questions they had. Grading was harder than I had expected, but it helped maintain my knowledge of chemistry. It was interesting to be on the other side of the coin. Seeing the work of several different students, I realized how important organization is in conveying ideas. I even saw some methods that I liked better than my own so I try to use them in my homework and lab reports. From this job, I gained a greater sense of responsibility and also sharpened my time management skills. I had to find time to grade for this class, as well as study for my own classes, research, and perform my responsibilities as a community assistant., Spanish Translator As part of my Medical Spanish class I volunteered at a Neighborhood Health Care pediatric clinic.  Approximately 30 percent of the patients at this clinic were Spanish-speakers. Although most of the parents knew some English, a lot of them felt more comfortable speaking Spanish. The majority of the staff was bilingual so while they did not depend on my Spanish-speaking abilities, they did give me opportunities to interact with patients and parents in Spanish.   During my time at the clinic, I shadowed the two physicians, Dr. Casey Moothart and Dr. Cynthia DeLaat, and the medical assistants so I got to see how entire appointments are run. I remember how nervous I was the first time I was allowed to speak, but I appreciate the opportunity because it became progressively easier to speak in Spanish. I feel more comfortable about using Spanish in my future career.   In addition, I translated several forms and guide sheets into Spanish for the clinic. In this process I learned more Spanish medical terminology, and I realized that sometimes phrases do not translate word for word. I can see how meanings can get lost in translation., ROAR Campus Tour Guide At my university, all tour guides are volunteers. We have to apply and interview to become part of the organization so our tour guides truly want to be tour guides. I am grateful to have been chosen because I have gained so much. ROAR has improved my communication skills through workshops and practice. I've gotten public speaking experience, as well as conversational experience as my tour groups range in size from a group of fifty to a group of three. I've also acquired a knack for walking backwards!   In addition, ROAR has given me exposure to people of various backgrounds. Most tours are with high school kids, but I've also given tours to inner city elementary school kids. One of my most interesting tours was with a group of Ukranian exchange students. Their professor did not speak much English so I had to work with his interpreter. I got to learn a little bit of Ukranian and Russian. I love meeting so many people.   This year I am part of the new mentor program within the organization that helps welcome and certify new guides., Knitting Cincinnati Clifton Knitters is a neighborhood knitting circle that I attend. Knitting has been one of my hobbies since the eighth grade. When I got to college, I felt too busy to knit, but my friend Isabel, a foreign exchange student, helped me see that I couldn't just work and go to meetings all the time. I had to take time for myself so I took up knitting again as a way to unwind and socialize during the week. I like that this hobby yields a physical product, even if the product sometimes turns out a little lop-sided. I like to think of it as part of the hand-knit charm, though my knitting has improved since I joined the knitting circle.,  Community Assistant, Women's Honorary Society CWEST is a women's honorary society at the University of Cincinnati that recognizes female leaders on campus. Members are nominated based on demonstration of the four pillars of the organization: leadership, scholarship, spirit, and sincerity. We focus on empowering other women. Every year we organize a conference that encourages underclass women to get involved on campus. I will be one of the mentors at the conference this year. We also organize a campus-wide talent show to raise money for the W.E.B. Dubois Academy, an inner city school. In addition, we have created the women's empowerment speaker series, in which we have inspirational women lecture on topics of interest. Another one of our projects is to rally support for under-attended athletic events, particularly women's basketball. This year I am eager to advance this effort as the spirit chair and treasurer of CWEST. I have learned a lot already about budgeting and planning events as I organized our first fundraiser of the year. I am sure that I will learn much more throughout the year., Undergraduate Research/Publication Dr. Buchholz is a great mentor to me. He has trained me to think like a scientist, reviewing all steps of the process when things don't turn out as expected.   After my experience with him in the WISE Program, I continued my research in his lab. I further developed my project from WISE.  Unfortunately, just as we were getting ready to start a manuscript for my data, someone else published a very similar study. Though it was a disappointing experience, it broadened my perspective on the academic world and tested the nature of my character. Instead of viewing this as a defeat, I took it as an opportunity to try something else.  I got to take over a graduate student's  project. I am also still going to have work published. Dr. Buchholz was asked to write a chapter in a textbook about hormone regulation and the evolution of frog metamorphic diversity. He invited me to write the portion regarding thryoid hormone transporters, and I aided in the revision process. Its projected publication date is May 2011. I am also beginning work on a manuscript detailing the results of my new project., Commissioned Painting I have always loved painting. For my high school senior art project, I painted a series of portraits of children in my family. I showed my project to my middle school art teacher, with whom I had kept in touch. She was quite impressed, and she put me in contact with a few people who were interested in having portraits done. Through these contacts I arranged to paint two portraits on commission. This experience is significant to me for various reasons. First, I learned a lot about how to conduct business. I scheduled meetings, worked around deadlines, and learned to convince clients to trust me. More significantly, I achieved one of my lifelong goals to sell a piece of my artwork., Physician Shadowing I shadowed Dr. Scott Joseph, a primary care physician at a VA community-based outpatient clinic. I observed him in his appointments with patients and afterwards as he would write up his notes. He also allowed me to go on rounds with him at the VA hospital. I learned more about what primary care doctors do and how they interact with the entire staff: nurses, receptionists, pharmacists, and other physicians. Everyone works as a team. I also learned how the VA medical system works in comparison to a private practice.  My favorite part of the experience was observing Dr. Joseph interacting with his patients. I realized that primary care is all about getting to know the patient. One of the best moments was when Dr. Joseph checked up on a patient's smoking habit, and the patient said that he had been cigarette free for several months. I cannot count how many times I heard Dr. Joseph suggest that a patient stop smoking. I could tell by his smile that he was sincerely happy. I could feel that it was a victory for the both of them., Taft Elementary School Volunteer/Mentor I was a volunteer with an after-school program run by the Imani Family Center at Taft Elementary School.  Taft is a Cincinnati Public School located in an urban area. The Imani Family Center's program was designed to help the children be successful in school and enrich their minds, at times trying to make up for programs that had recently been cut. We would start each session by helping the kids with their homework. Then we would have an enrichment activity. The program was fairly new so Ms. Stephens, the director, allowed student volunteers to create a lot of activities for the children. For example, I helped pilot a weekly Spanish lesson. I also organized a few art projects., Early Assurance Program/Research ROSE is an early assurance program for the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UCCOM) offered to selected students. Once accepted, the basic requirements are to maintain a 3.40 cumulative GPA, a 3.45 BCPM GPA, and a cumulative score of at least 30 on the MCAT with no less than a nine in any section. The program incorporated two summers at a research internship at UCCOM. I worked in the laboratory of Dr. Shao-Chun Wang, Ph.D, in the Department of Cancer and Cell Biology researching proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a tumor marker. I gained a lot of respect for researchers during my experience. Dr. Wang and his students worked tirelessly, day and night. I tried my best to keep up! At the end of my second year of internship, I presented a poster on my work at a summer undergraduate research capstone poster session. Research means little if you are unable to communicate your findings., Community Assistant Stratford Heights was an off-campus, university-affiliated residence hall. A community assistant (CA) at Stratford Heights played a similar role to a resident advisor in a typical residence hall. My responsibilities included helping with clerical work in the main office, seeing that property policies were followed, and aiding in resolving any conflicts that arose in my house. I worked specifically in the Center for Community Engagement (CCE) House, where I had fourteen residents under my wing. This house was themed for people interested in community service. In addition to my duties as a normal CA, I helped plan community building activities. For example, we had family dinners once a month. I also planned some service activities. Once we helped clean out an abandoned apartment for a neighborhood restoration project. I also led focus groups to help find the direction for the CCE House. The following year, the number of people who applied to be residents of the CCE House nearly doubled., Darwin T. Turner Scholar The Darwin T. Turner Scholars Program is a full-tuition scholarship given to exceptional students of color.  Turner Scholars are required to maintain a 3.0 GPA and commit at least 30 hours to community service. However, Turner is not just a scholarship, it is a family. The organization has supported me and helped me grow. They encouraged me to do things that I might not have done otherwise. For example, every year they pay for us to attend the campus leadership conference and the campus diversity conference. Also, I have made friends from different backgrounds, who got me out to events that I normally would not have attended like a salsa dancing workshop.  I loved being a Turner Scholar from the start so my freshman year I joined the Turner Scholar Ambassadors, a leadership group within the organization that helps plan events for the other Scholars and represents the organization in meetings with donors. Within the Ambassador program, I served as co-chairperson of the Community Engagement Committee from October 2007-June 2008 and chairperson of the Diversity Committee from February 2010 to June 2010.  As chair person, some of the events I helped coordinate were a coat drive for Taft Elementary School and a Cinco de Mayo program to educate students on campus about the history of the holiday., Women in Science and Engineering The WISE Program gives undergraduate women the opportunity to do laboratory research for a summer with a mentor. This is how I started my involvement in research. I worked in the lab of Dr. Daniel Buchholz in the University of Cincinnati Department of Biology. My project focused on the role of thyroid hormone transporters in regulating thyroid hormone levels in the cell.   I culminated the summer by writing a paper on my research and  giving a presentation before an audience of faculty and peers. One of my proudest moments in college was when I finished giving my WISE presentation. I was excited to have researched new material, and I was even more excited to have mastered the subject well enough to explain it to others.  In addition, the WISE Program offered me a lot of professional development through weekly seminars and practice. Some very helpful topics were: how to deal with the challenges of being a woman in the workplace, how to format a scientific paper, and how to write a press release.,  Undergraduate Researcher, Nicaraguan Culture and Social Service Words cannot do justice to the experience I had in Nicaragua. I traveled to Granada with a group from the University Honors Program. We spent weekdays at a local after-school enrichment program as teaching assistants. We helped with homework, played, and taught some English. Even though I was half a world away from home, the kids reminded me a lot of the kids I worked with at Taft Elementary School back in Cincinnati. Sometimes people around the world are more similar than they think. Of course, not everything was the same. I felt a bit of culture shock, too.  The biggest shock was the poverty. I will never forget the day we rode into the village of Los Cocos on those dusty, unpaved roads. It was Independence Day so we had the day off work. Instead of taking a leisure day, we unanimously decided to visit a poor village in the countryside. We all chipped in two dollars to buy several pounds of rice and beans to distribute as gifts.   As we made our way through the village, I realized why rice and beans were such a gift.  The homes in Los Cocos were often nothing more than rickety wood shacks with rusty tin roofs. No one had running water or electricity. This trip got me wondering why I was so worried about grades and meetings when there are much greater concerns in the world."

Scott steadied his right hand as he lowered a tiny pair of scissors to the vessel and created a minuscule nick.  After just a few minutes, the vessel was cannulated and tied off.  It was my first day of co-op, and I was already standing next to the operating table watching surgery on a fetal sheep.  Less than a week later, I was the one scrubbing in to stand across from, and assist, Scott with surgery.  Although going into medicine was not my primary goal when entering college, this experience directed me on my personal journey of realizing my passion for the field of medicine, and my desire to become a physician.  I enjoyed everything about being in the operating room, from the sights and noises to the fast-paced and synchronized teamwork happening up at the field.  For as long as I can remember, I have always been drawn to math and science and have had a fascination with how and why things work.  Additionally, I enjoyed the field of medicine.  I knew, however, that television, stories from my sister working as a nurse, and a personal experience with having maxillofacial surgery weren't quite enough to decide on a medical career just then.  When it came time to apply for college, I decided that biomedical engineering would be well suited for my strengths and interests; I would be able to earn a practical degree in engineering while further exploring the field of medicine.  Additionally, by obtaining my degree at the University of Cincinnati, I knew I would be able to explore my options with the hands-on experience of co-op work rotations while at the same time helping to personally fund my education.    Wanting to keep all options open for my first co-op, I applied to both medical research jobs and to engineering industry jobs.  After researching and preparing for my first couple of interviews, I quickly realized that my interests lay more strongly within medicine; accordingly, I accepted a position in Dr. Eghtesady's research lab.  Although our patients in the lab were sheep, I was able to gain first-hand experience with O.R. technologies and patient care beginning on day one. While the learning curve was steep, this co-op brought me more excitement and fulfillment than I ever anticipated.  In particular, I enjoyed the coordinated team effort during surgeries and post-operative follow-up.  The experience also helped me further develop my communication and decision-making skills while working within our lab group.  I continued to rotate between co-op and work for the ensuing quarters.  This unique opportunity allowed for the connection of classwork with both lab work and what I had seen through clinical shadowing.  Co-op helped me to develop a deeper level of understanding my coursework.  For example, the flow of events in an O.R. became an important tie in many medical device design classes, and effectively designing products for the user.  Conversely, my coursework helped me to further develop my understanding of lab concepts, from the basic anatomy and physiology of the circulatory system to the pressure-volume loops seen in engines and heart function.  I am drawn to the field of medicine as I desire a profession which will constantly challenge me as well as encourage a lifetime of learning. My eagerness to learn and to be challenged is evident through the rigor of my undergraduate curriculum as well as through my experiences in the lab.  Working in the lab has given me the opportunity to participate in both bench work and animal work.  I believe this will be useful because bench work, translated into an animal model, can ultimately lead to important clinical developments.  I hope to be a part of this latter transition, from bench to bedside, by continuing my education in pursuit of a doctor of medicine degree.  If afforded the opportunity to attend medical school, I will work my hardest to make the most out of not only my education, but also every opportunity that I encounter along my path.

    "text": "As the bus bounded through narrow dirt roads and sharply followed the curves of the mountains, I wondered what I had gotten myself into. I had been looking forward to this trip for months, but I simply did not know what to expect. I had traveled to Cuba with my parents when I was 16, and while it was a unique and eye-opening experience, this new journey through Honduras was very different. The other members of NYU's Global Medical Brigades (GMB) team and I had woken up at 5:30 that morning and endured a tumultuous bus ride for hours before arriving at our destination. When we began unloading the bus and walking towards the site at which we would be setting up our clinic for the day, we saw the Hondurans waiting to be treated. There were hundreds of them lined up, awaiting our arrival. A powerful feeling overwhelmed me as I realized that we actually had the capability to help them.   We had to create an efficient system of students triaging, physicians diagnosing and prescribing, and other students running the pharmacy in order to treat the 1,300 patients we saw throughout the week we operated our free clinics in Honduras. I was utterly enthralled by every aspect of the trip. It was, of course, a wonderful trip in which to take part for its volunteerism and service aspects. We were providing medical care to people who so rarely saw a physician that many of them were unfamiliar with the term allergy. Further, we were confident that other GMB teams would return to these areas to provide follow up to our patients in coming months and years until Honduran physicians could do so themselves. That week of service also gave me the opportunity to work and learn within a different culture, something I have always valued. It has certainly improved my Spanish-speaking skills as well. Ultimately this was one of the many experiences that confirmed my desire to live, work and practice as a physician.   Before reaching to my decision to become a physician, I had questioned entering a number of different fields, two of which were psychology and theater. While seemingly divergent career choices, I found within these two possibilities a common thread that eventually led me to my current career choice. A central component in these areas was human interaction, something I had thrived on throughout high school when I was a devoted board member of my school's drama club and an actress in almost every performance throughout my high school career. This same component also played a central role in my early desire to become a psychologist. By my third year of college, my interest in human interaction and the social sciences expanded by joining with the physical sciences, an area upon which the practice of medicine depends. My enjoyment of the physical and biological science curriculum at NYU far exceeded my expectations. I began taking neuroscience classes within my psychology major; the physical sciences simply made sense and intrigued me more than many of my other classes. After taking Cognitive Neuroscience, I began reading any literature I could find regarding the nervous system. This led to my interest in the field of Neurology. I pursued a research position in the Neurology department at NYU Medical Center to learn more about the practice of Neurology as well as research. This work demonstrated to me the continually evolving nature of medicine. Medicine is a field that will feed my interest and curiosity regarding the human body's complexity and variability.   \tWhile I first came to the decision to become a physician after I began working in a private physicians office, it seemed that every subsequent activity in which I became involved and each class that I took further solidified that choice. My involvement as an actress, camp counselor, and assistant teacher made me realize the enjoyment I derived from simple human interactions. My first experiences with patients demonstrated to me my desire to continue such experiences. The pre-medical curriculum and the research in which I took part fascinated me and aroused a certain curiosity and desire to obtain new knowledge, a desire of which I was previously unaware. My current position as a medical assistant at a medical group in Manhattan has further nurtured my motivation to become a physician and delve deeper into the workings of the human body. While I did not initially realize I would chose medicine as a career, it seems to have chosen me in the unconventional path I took to arrive at this decision and in its connections to every other part of my personality and my life. The 14th St. Y At the 14th St. Y, I worked as an assistant teacher. My responsibilities included caring for children ages 1-3, planning art projects and activities, and creating a safe, open environment in which children could learn and play., Women and Family Health- Private Physicians Office At Women and Family Health, I worked as a receptionist/administrative assistant. My responsibilities included answering phones, scheduling appointments, scanning patients' charts, performing clinical quality indexing of charts, and greeting/registering patients when they arrived for their visit. This position allowed me to have substantial contact with patients., NYU Global Medical Brigades Global Medical Brigades is a volunteer student-run group that organizes clinical missions to Honduras, providing primary care to impoverished, rural areas of the country. Within this group, I work as the Physician Recruitment Coordinator. Thus, I have been responsible for recruiting medical personnel to join our group on the medical missions to Honduras and communicating with them about the trip. I am also one of the fund-raising group leaders. This position requires me to coordinate raising money to purchase medication for our trip. I have helped organize a number of fund-raising events. My responsibilities at the clinics in Honduras included helping to organize the pharmacy, getting patients their medication, working in triage, taking patients' vitals, and shadowing doctors., PhysioAge- Private Physicians Office I began working at PhysioAge Medical Group after graduation and will continue working there until shortly before I begin medical school. I work as a medical assistant and perform biomarker testing on patients. Such testing required my obtaining certification in phlebotomy. My tasks in the office include testing patients' skin elasticity, arterial stiffness, muscular-skeletal strength and lung capacity, drawing blood, preparing the blood for testing, performing ultrasounds that measure the carotid intima-medial thickness  and analyzing them and performing bone density scans. I also perform administrative duties such as preparing patient charts for the physicians and checking patients out after their appointments., PADI Open Water Diver Certification I recently became certified as an open water scuba diver. To gain certification, it was necessary to take diving courses, participate in a confined water dive, participate in an open water dive and correctly perform a number of skills required in diving. Through the classroom requirement, I learned the necessary diving skills, safety regulations, dive physiology and rescue techniques. The confined and open water dives allowed the practice of these acquired skills., University Honors Scholar I was named a University Honors Scholar through New York University. I received a certificate and the honor of wearing a gold tassel on my cap at the College of Arts and Sciences Baccalaureate Ceremony. I earned this honor by maintaining above a 3.5 grade point average throughout my time in college, while also completing my  College of Arts and Sciences requirements., American Eagle I worked at American Eagle Outfitters as a sales associate. I was responsible for assisting customers, working at the cash registers, occasionally helping to restock the store and keeping the merchandise organized., NYU Medical Center Department of Neurology I worked at the New York University Medical Center within the Department of Neurology as a research assistant. I was responsible for assisting physicians with their research in the area of Epilepsy. My tasks included reviewing patients' charts and discharge summaries in order to determine the presence of a seizure and entering information from the charts into a research database. Our study is currently pending publication in the American Journal of Epilepsy., NYU Student Health Center- Peer Education Program I worked at the New York University Student Health Center as a Sexual Health Advocate through the peer education program. Participation in this program required an application, interview, 40 hours of training, and mandatory refresher courses once a month. My responsibilities included holding workshops and participating in health promotional events through NYU with the goal of educating other students in the area of sexual health. I also dealt with students in a one-on-one setting, answering any questions they had pertaining to sexual health."

    "text": "As I walked the halls of Pacific Garden Mission, Chicago's largest homeless shelter, I realized this was the type of environment I would like to work in.  It was spring break and I was staying on Chicago's South Side, volunteering through Sunshine Gospel Ministries and learning about the realities and struggles of urban poverty.  I was especially impressed by PGM's medical ministry through which individuals receive treatment that, due to lack of insurance and income, they would otherwise be unable to afford.  By the end of the week I felt a strong pull towards urban medical ministry.  I am excited to combine my passions for science, helping others, and working with children to become a doctor and serve populations that do not receive adequate healthcare.       I can trace my interest in science back to my childhood when my brother and I would play doctor and perform operations on our stuffed animals.  My father, a medical school graduate himself, further cultivated my scientific curiosity by answering my inquiries about medicine, assisting with school projects, and discussing topics such as string theory with me whenever I asked about them.  Encouraged by my interest and performance in science courses I was set on becoming a veterinarian until my junior year of high school when I took anatomy and physiology and then participated in University of Cincinnati's HCARE program.  Through this opportunity I met and spoke with medical students and professionals in fields including pharmacy, nursing, and occupational therapy, which solidified my decision to pursue a healthcare career.    When I entered college I was determined to become a doctor and major in Biology.  I enrolled in organic chemistry and biology in my first semester along with a writing intensive religion class, which was a heavier load than I was able to handle.  Since I had not needed to seek academic assistance in high school, I did not realize that in college even those who are doing well do so.  I reevaluated my academic choices over winter break, and spring semester I let go of my pride and began attending review sessions regularly and studying in groups.  I raised my chemistry grade and have made the dean's list every semester since.    Undeterred by my freshman year performance, I continued taking biology classes but was not positive that this was the right major for me until sophomore year when I took developmental biology, which I found to be interesting, challenging and engaging.  The following summer I started conducting research in this field by studying the enteric nervous system using zebrafish as a model system.  As I fed fluorescent food to fish and observed its passage through their intestinal systems, comparing the peristalsis rates of wildtype zebrafish and those lacking enteric neurons, I became certain that biology is the field that I find most intellectually engaging and enjoyable.   While I am passionate about science, as a religion major and someone interested in medical ministry I recognize that providing care to others goes beyond meeting their physical needs.  Therefore I enjoy volunteering and find especially fulfilling positions where I am counseling and mentoring my peers.  I have done so by being a sophomore advisor for a freshman dorm, leading a bible study through my campus ministry group for two years, mentoring freshmen during their first semester at Emory, and working as an RA.  I love when this job allows me to assist residents with issues, whether personal, social or academic, and whether through formal counseling or spontaneous conversations.    Another interest I have harbored for many years, which is related to my passion for service, is working with children.  One of my most memorable experiences working with children was when I was a counselor at Stepping Stones summer day camp for individuals with special needs.  I was responsible for twenty children, ages ten to twelve, nine hours a day, five days a weeks, and every day was a hectic whirlwind of leading the campers from one activity to another, making sure they all ate their lunches and got changed for swimming, and planning activities to engage everyone though their needs and personalities differed vastly.  I went home each day exhausted but satisfied.    Due to my love of working with children the field that most interests me is pediatrics.  My decision to enter this specialty has been reaffirmed by the opportunities I have had to shadow pediatricians.  I have enjoyed being able to listen to children's heart murmurs, see real life examples of cases I had only before heard or read about, and view x-rays to understand the internal appearance of patients' outwardly exhibited conditions.   After witnessing the impact these doctors have had on the lives of patients and their families, I have realized how rewarding a profession it is.  Enthusiastic and determined, I look at difficult situations as opportunities to devise innovative solutions rather than as insurmountable hurdles.  I am thus aware of the obstacles, especially financial, that I will face doing medical ministry, but am nonetheless prepared to meld my passions for science, service, and children to become a pediatrician and serve impoverished populations fulltime. Summer Day Camp Counselor As the Crickets Unit Leader at the Stepping Stones summer day camp I supervised 15-20 children through daily activities including arts, theatre, sports,  and nature.  I developed activities to engage campers with a range of special needs including Cerebral Palsy, Autism and Down Syndrome and assessed and addressed their physical needs, including feeding and changing, especially for those who were non-ambulatory and nonverbal., Undergraduate Research I conducted research on the enteric nervous system of zebrafish and specifically the efficacy of a screen for gut motility that has implications for developing drugs to alleviate constipation., Undergraduate Biology Symposium I created and presented a poster for my research conducted in the Shepherd Lab this past year at the spring Biology Symposium.  I tested the efficiency of an assay for the movement of fluorescent food through the gastrointestinal tract of zebrafish., Resident Advisor I facilitate community among on average 30 students and counsel them through academic, personal and social issues, develop and execute at least nine programs a semester, assume on-call duties 2-3 nights a month and enforce University policies.  I also am enrolled in the RA class during first semester and am on a Residence Life committee that meets twice a month to plan recruitment., Greek Life I have been a member of Gamma Phi Beta since the spring of my freshman year, and have held several positions.  I served on the Philanthropy Day Committee in the 07/08 school year to plan a specific day of recruitment, am the chair of this committee for the 09/10 school year, served as the Ritual Chair in both spring and fall semesters of 2008, and have been a member of the Philanthropy Committee, which plans, organizes, and facilitates the sorority's philnathropy events since fall 2008., Sunday School Teacher I have been teaching Sunday school since I was 12.  I have volunteered at Zion UCC and Crossroads Community Church in Cincinnati, and Intown Community Church and Shallowford in Atlanta.  At Crossroads and Intown I worked one-on-one with special needs children., Dean's List I have made the dean's list at Emory the past 4 semesters., Freshman Mentor I help freshman acclimate to Emory, and act as a resource for any questions or concerns they may have in their first year and especially their first semester of college., Summer Researcher I worked in the Shepherd Lab, which researches the enteric nervous system using zebrafish as a model system.  I worked to create a vector containing the 8.3 transcription factor region for Phox2b using Tol2kit technology, which would have then been injected into fish embryos to create transgenic fish., Campus Ministry My freshman year I attended small and large group meetings for RUF, and during the 07/08 and 08/09 school years I attended large groups and led a small group.  I also served on the ministry team, the core group of members who meet once a week to plan events, both years, and will continue to do so next school year., Religion Honors Society Theta Alpha Kappa is a national honor society for Religious Studies students, and I was inducted into it this past semester., Archaeological Dig This summer, for nine hours a day, six days a week, I participated in the archaeological dig at Tel Halif.  I excavated a four by four meter square in order to find and articulate the artifacts and architecture from the Iron Age II period of settlement there., Teaching Assistant This was a work study job through which I assisted teachers at Emory's Clifton School, a preschool and daycare for Emory faculty and staff.  I fed, read to, and played educational games with the children., Sophomore Advisor Through this volunteer leadership opportunity I assisted my RA in facilitating community among 28 freshman girls.  I planned and executed four programs a semester, and addressed the social, personal, and academic needs and concerns of my residents."

    "text": "There was no grand epiphany that defined my decision to become a physician. Rather, there was a long and imperfect journey of lessons learned that crystallized for me two essential understandings: I am motivated to become a physician by the power of the patient-provider relationship and by the opportunity to work towards the development and implementation of health care services. Physicians have the remarkable privilege to engage in sincere human communication and interaction given the profoundly personal nature of the human body and mind. Engagement in this powerful patient-provider relationship and in the systems of care delivery that support this relationship are services I strive to provide.   My drive to be part of the patient-provider relationship is deeply rooted in my family and our history. My parents maintain both feet firmly planted in the old neighborhood. Our house has always been a home for those with medical and economic problems. It has always been a revolving door for dysfunctional relatives, handymen, and friends, often unemployed, alcoholic and even schizophrenic. My father insisted I help with the construction always going on in our old house. For him hard work was part of life. He and his family immigrated to work as migrant farm-workers in California and he awed me with stories of his childhood in Michoacn, Mexico and of the grinding poverty that followed his family into California, where they lived in rat infested shacks in Salinas and of his work with the Farmer Workers Union. My mother, on the other hand, is the product of the East Los Angeles housing projects and a sink-or-swim fatherless household where she literally fought for her share of food. She went on to become a physician and has worked everyday since as a primary care provider in the community. Through example, she taught me how be a fighter; and through her, (though it was never her intention) I saw the frustrations and brute-hard work it takes to compassionately care for and educate patients while being a dedicated mother and wife. My father inspired in me the heart and skills to serve my community, and my mother, a ruthless perseverance and non romanticized view of the profession. Through their example, I was shown that everyday life is lived in the service of others. Service and compassion are not expressed in isolated moments, but are inherent to everyday human communication and interaction.  My academic and extracurricular pursuits are extensions of these lessons learned from my family. They show an unwavering dedication to those most vulnerable and a developed commitment to the medical profession. As I sought a college that would push me out of my comfort zone, Princeton was a natural fit for its academically rigorous environment. As president of the Chicano Caucus student group, I was the voice and leader for the Latino students and community. I worked to integrate the community with tutoring and services on campus, while successfully returning the course, Latino Politics, to the course offerings. At White Memorial Hospital while researching their promotora diabetes program, I was introduced to community medicine and I began to value medicine as a tangible, cross-disciplinary, and dynamic field. Subsequently, for my thesis I jumped at the opportunity to bridge the sciences with my desire to serve and directly interact with the community. I initially envisioned a project that assessed the relationship between depression and diabetes management among Latinas via interviews and chart audits. I wanted to directly integrate the voice of the patient with empirical analysis. Through these experiences, I learned to appreciate medicine as a bridge between the social and biological sciences, as a fascinating discipline in which one can produce personal and tangible outcomes in the lives of others.  At the Disparities Solutions Center at Massachusetts General Hospital where I am currently employed, I have learned that participating in the patient-provider relationship extends beyond direct care and into the structures and policies that coordinate care. I am fully engaged in the research of health care inequities and in translating this research into better services within the infrastructure of health care organizations. Through projects such as the Disparities Leadership Program, an executive leadership training program, I learned that providing the best care requires effective, efficient health care services. Although, I am driven, at my core, to be directly part of the patient-provider relationship, as I strive to be challenged and to continue to grow, I want to also work towards the strengthening of that relationship through the development and implementation of health care services.  At each step along my journey, from my family's home to Princeton, and beyond, I have learned valuable lessons and emerged a stronger and more mature woman, determined to be challenged by the health care field. I am inspired by the communication and interaction between patient and care giver. I look forward to continue learning from experienced faculty, colleagues, students, and from those whom I will one day provide care to--the patients. Providing their care is the reason I am committed to becoming a physician.

Racial and Gender Differences in Emergency Room Triage Assessment and Test Ordering for Chest Pain. 2009; (Preparing for submission).  Nationally representative emergency department data was used to examine the association between race and presenting symptom, triage assignment, test ordering and final emergency department myocardial infarction diagnosis among patients presenting with chest pain., Day Care Provider -Regularly provided care for university professor's children -Responsible for picking up children from school, driving children to their respective activities, and assisting with their homework, Special Education Teaching Assistant Through the Department of Special Education, Rehabilitation, & School Psychology at the University of Arizona and the University of the Americas, I participated in a summer program on bilingual and special education in Mexico City and Guanajuato, Mexico.  -Taught lesson plans and physical therapy activities to special needs children and their parents  -Shadowed at Clinica OIRA at La Universidad de Las Americas which serves disadvantaged children with learning disabilities and special needs -Audited two graduate level classes on special and bilingual education in Mexico -Lived full-time with a local family, Senior Thesis Project Title: The Growing Epidemic: A Review of the Mechanism and Genetics of Diabetes and A Study of Glycemic Control in Latino Patients  Advisor: B. Rosemary Grant, Ph.D.  My thesis was comprised of two parts.  Part I was a review of the molecular mechanisms and genetics of type 2 diabetes.  Part II was a retrospective chart review study in which I looked at how patient factors (changes in BMI, depression, medication adherence, gender, age, lipid profile) are associated with glycemic control in approximately 100 Latino patients.  Results showed a significant interaction between age and gender with younger males having worse glycemic control. This topic developed out of an interest to explore the role of depression in disease management.  The first several months were dedicated to a comprehensive review of the current literature and research on diabetes type 2. Based on my research I independently developed the study scope and variables, obtained IRB approval, and audited patient charts. With guidance from my advisor, I performed statistical analysis and final synthesis of data. I defended my thesis to department faculty and presented findings at Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Poster Session., Research Assistant -Worked with project coordinator on the New Immigrant Survey (a large-scale, longitudinal prospective-retrospective study evaluating health, economics, assimilation, and lifestyles of immigrants and their children) -Performed background research for survey development and edited/proofread survey questions and design, Research Assistant , Student Employee , Research Assistant , Volunteer , Employee"

    "text": "Being raised by two overworked, small-town family physicians, I swore that I would never enter the field of medicine. Experiencing firsthand the level of sacrifice required to practice medicine properly, I sought a field where I could simultaneously assist people while having more time to maintain a higher degree of family life and personal time. Even in high school, I knew that I wanted to serve people; the only questions were what area I would work in and what degree of sacrifice I was willing to endure. As a result of my experiences with various volunteers in church, I decided to go into youth ministry so I could have the same effect on other teens throughout my life.  The breakdown of my initial aversion to medicine was a process precipitated by my realization that while I enjoyed working with people, my specific skill set would be better utilized in another field. This self-discovery began in my sophomore year as I volunteered with a youth group. The experience went well, and I received reassurance that I desired to spend my life helping people. However, I began to have doubts about my chosen field of youth ministry as I missed the intellectual and analytical challenges of the hard sciences I experienced even in high school. Junior year brought about upper level youth ministry classes, and with them, further questions about my vocational decision. While I enjoyed the volunteer work, I realized that not using my primary interests and talents to their utmost would lead to disappointment later in life.  About this time, my mother procured a part-time position as faculty with a University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Family Medicine residency program in an underprivileged area. As I saw her having the opportunity to serve the needy without needing to spend many additional hours of work per night at home, I was exposed to a different element of medicine, one which had the potential not to dominate family life. This forced me to reevaluate my rejection of medicine, and as I opened my mind to it, I began to see my traits lining up with those required in the field of medicine: a desire to help individuals, an analytical and thorough nature, and a love of complex scientific problems to be solved. This love of science had lain dormant since high school, and I decided that science should form a cornerstone of whatever future plans were sought, even as medicine became an increasingly interesting and less repulsive field.   As my college Cincinnati Christian University lacked appropriate pre-medical science courses, I made use of my school's participation in a regional educational consortium and began my first college science classes at Northern Kentucky University due to its proximity and the ease of cross-registration there. Taking my first basic sciences as a second semester junior in the spring of 2008, I remembered the pleasure of fresh challenges in chemistry and was enthralled by the especially engaging material in biology which helped to reassure me of my decision to do something with science. I also began to shadow various doctors to get a more diverse view of what medicine entailed apart from what I was accustomed to through my experiences with my parents. Every physician I shadowed, from the allergist to the orthopedic surgeon, showed the utmost respect, professionalism, and compassion for each patient. Through these experiences, the looming threat of the lifestyle sacrifices to be made became less ominous in the face of the obvious satisfaction of helping patients in need.  During the spring break of my junior year, I joined my parents on a medical mission trip to Matamoros, Mexico. Seeing people sitting idly in the streets and smelling the raw, festering stream of sewage between streets brought about strong feelings of compassion and a desire to increase the quality of life of impoverished people. Over the course of three days, several clinics were set up in which 250 people were seen and over $15,000 of donated medicines was distributed. As I had been trained to do take vital signs and triage patients as they came into the clinics, I experienced firsthand the relief a simple Es bueno can bring about when telling a patient their blood pressure is not a cause for concern or the feelings of significance and importance brought about by alerting the doctors that a patient might need to be seen immediately. Above all, I saw the thankfulness and openness of people being served simply out of love. It was this trip and the experiences gained on it that cemented the field of medicine as my chosen profession. Until that point, I had been cautiously seeking a field into which to devote myself wholly, but after this I knew that I had found my calling.  My transformation has been a slow process, but I am more confident of my chosen path and excited about being able to spend my life helping others in a way that will use my talents and engage my interests. While I once shied away from medicine due to an aversion to the level of sacrifice required, I have now come to realize that it is possible to maintain a healthy balance of work and personal or family time. While that may not be easy to do, the satisfaction of living a life of service in the practice of medicine makes the forfeitures worthwhile. Shadowing As soon as medicine began to gain an appeal to me, I asked my father if I could shadow him and for his recommendation of excellent local specialists I could follow. I shadowed them while I was home on various breaks throughout the next year and a half. I was also able to shadow my primary care physician in Cincinnati as well as a physician who had graduated from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine after graduating from Cincinnati Christian University and pursuing science classes at Northern Kentucky University, a path analogous to mine.  -Dr. Edgar Boone, family physician; 1 full day including hospital rounds and nursing home visits -Dr. Amador Delamerced, internist; 1 full day including hospital rounds -Dr. Bob Bennett, family physician; 1 half day -Dr. Martin Murcek, allergist; 1 full day -Dr. Mark Zelkovic, general surgeon; 1 full day observing surgeries and hospital rounds -Dr. Daniel Haffner, orthopedic surgeon; 2 full days: 1 in office and 1 in surgery -Dr. William Markle, family physician; 1 evening: observed a free clinic for uninsured, Ski Club at Cincinnati Christian University Charter member of the Cincinnati Christian University Ski Club, Health Professions Club at Northern Kentucky University I attended most of the biweekly meetings which are designed to present relevant information about various professions in healthcare. I also volunteered with the club's participation in Northern Kentucky University's Relay for Life event., Global Missions Health Conference I attended this weekend conference to understand some of the dynamics of long term and short term medical mission or service work. I attended question and answer sessions on becoming a medical missionary, a class on raising funds and going out to the missionary field despite medical school debt, and a session on faith in the practice of medicine. Rear Admiral Tim Zeimer, Dr. Carl Taylor, and other doctors led plenary sessions regarding malaria initiatives, HIV/AIDS work, and other public health issues.  Contacts made at this conference led to a commitment for my family to serve at a health clinic for the underserved in Glenallen, Alaska in August, 2009. There I will volunteer in the clinic, functioning as a medical assistant., Airsoft Louisville I became involved with airsoft, a sport similar to paintball, after introduction by a close friend. I quickly became very active, and drove down to Louisville many weekends to play in regular weekly games or tournaments, with some games requiring out of state road trips. I was also involved in helping to design or set up some events., Volunteering with a Youth Group I visited with the teens before and after church services on Sunday mornings and assisted with the youth meetings on Sunday evenings. I helped run games, lead small groups, and talked and played games with the teens., Tutoring with Whiz Kids I volunteered to tutor a fourth grader once per week at a local elementary school. I would meet with him after school alongside other tutor-pupil pairs in the program and work on reading ability and comprehension as well as mathematics. My student seemed to stumble with many words and lacked a a vocabulary typical of a fourth grader, but by the end of our partnership at the end of the semester, he was able to read with less halting and stumbling over words. Perhaps just as rewarding was the progress he made on his various mathematics tables., Tutoring at Woodward High School I volunteered to tutor at a local alternative high school as part of a class project. Over the course of the semester, I would go to the high school once per week and spend 1-3 hours helping kids with basic math and reading skills., Member of Food Services Leadership Board I was asked to be a member of a student and faculty board to seek input from students on possible changes to the dining services and design plans to implement those suggestions. This board met weekly and was instrumental in a number of changes, including many suggestions which were incorporated into the renovation of the dining facilities for the following year., Korsakoff's Syndrome Research In my work over the summer, much of the initial testing of an animal model of Korsakoff's Syndrome had already been finished, so I participated mostly in finishing of the project prior to the final examinations of the stains and the writing and publication of the paper. I performed tasks such as: growing cell cultures, utilizing perfusion techniques to acquire rat brain tissue samples, preparing slides from frozen sections of rat brains, and developing and implementing staining procedures., Medical Mission Trip to Mexico My family drove to Matamoros during my spring break to run medical clinics over the course of three days. Clinics were set up each day in 2 churches and a school. We worked with local churches to coordinate the events and allow them to do outreach work while we were there. Over 250 men, women, and children were seen, and over $15,000 worth of medicines were distributed. I was trained to perform basic triage work, and while we were in the makeshift clinics, I checked patients in, recorded vital signs, and alerted my parents if a patient had abnormal vitals. I also assisted in setting up the improvised pharmacy, writing out and giving instructions orally in Spanish, and distributing the medicines. On a few of the more interesting cases, one of my parents would allow me into the examination room. There was not much time in between patients once the clinics opened, but occasionally we would have time to play soccer with the local kids., Data Entry and Diabetes Self Management Coach The office of Drs. Edgar and Joy Boone began participating this past spring in the collaborative effort of the Pennsylvania Chronic Care Initiative, established by Governor Rendell. It is primarily concerned with improving the health of diabetic patients, and thereby reducing health care costs through more intensive medical and lifestyle management. Initially, I worked by remotely transferring patient data from the electronic medical records (EMR) to the Initiative's registry. This work continues on a limited basis to enter new patients and update new lab work.  When that phase of the Initiative began to slow down, I was trained to call patients to assist them with their self-management goals. This style of diabetes management being implemented is geared more towards small, incremental, patient-derived goals, and my job entails calling those patients who agree to be contacted and encouraging their progress., Various Academic Awards Throughout College These are some of the academic honors earned throughout my careers at Cincinnati Christian University (CCU) and Northern Kentucky University (NKU):  -Graduated from CCU summa cum laude -CCU class rank: 3 -Member of CCU's Delta Aleph Tau honor society -Dean's List, CCU, all 8 semesters, 2005-2009 -Dean's List, NKU, Spring 2008-present, Various Personal Hobbies and Interests These are some of the most important activities to me: -Skiing (see Ski Club entry): I have skied since age 5, and regularly ski over 10 times per season. -Hockey: I have played since third grade in a local league, but have only able to play several times per year since starting college. -Hunting: I have hunted since age 12 and manage to make it home for several hunting trips most years. -SCUBA Diving: certified, August 2008 -Airsoft (see airsoft entry): I spent most weekends of my sophomore and early junior years playing airsoft in Louisville. -Ice and Roller Skating: multiple times per semester -Hiking: I took a spring break trip with a friend to Utah to hike through two national parks. -Rock Climbing: My sister, several friends, and I have become involved in this sport, and we climb at an indoor gym several times per week. I have also been able to climb outdoors in West Virginia several times. -Exercise: This is my most regular and time intensive activity, as I usually work out for 10-15 hours per week with weights, running, swimming, and/or biking., Vector Marketing Vector Marketing distributed Cutco Cutlery, and I was employed during summers as a sales representative. I met people in their homes where I developed relationships with them and presented the products. Through my career, I personally sold over $45,000 worth of cutlery and met with over 250 families. I worked as a sales representative the first summer, and was promoted to assistant manager the following summer with additional responsibilities including interviewing potential hirees, assisting with training, and mentoring new representatives. The following summer, I was promoted to sales manager, where I was at times working over 70 hours per week and spoke at regional and divisional Vector Marketing conferences in that role."

    "text": "The Educators  I was being taken to see the principal. As I entered the building with my father, a family physician, my nostrils sensed the characteristic aroma of the nursing home.  He allowed me to go with him to visit one of his patients, Mr. Rodamer, his old grade school principal. I watched my father as he removed the potentially malignant mole from Mr. Rodamer's head.  This was one of many times I had the opportunity to witness the compassion doctors have for their patients.  On his day off, my father drove to the nursing home to perform a procedure that would have otherwise required the patient be transported to an office, and then took the time to talk about old times, all for a man who gave him numerous paddlings when he misbehaved in grade school!  I come from a family that holds knowledge and education in high esteem.  Our house and my grandparents' house have rooms full of books; we have highly competitive rounds of Trivial Pursuit at almost every family gathering; and we know that 7:30 p.m. on weekdays is time for Jeopardy...and I love it.  This is not surprising with so many teachers and principals in the family.  Even my father was a math and science teacher in Nepal in the Peace Corps before going to medical school.  In his practice, he is known for taking time with his patients to educate them.  The adage, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, holds true for me with my quest for knowledge and my position as a math and science tutor at Transylvania.  In addition to my high regard for educators and education, I recognize the importance of life experiences as educators.  As Mark Twain said, I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.  My experiences in volunteering and various jobs have taught me life lessons I never would have learned from a textbook.  While volunteering at St. Elizabeth hospital, I remember how appreciative patients were just for my company while they waited for an MRI or an X-ray.  I witnessed firsthand the importance of the human component of medicine.  My four summers at the Boone County Parks Department introduced me to hundreds of kids with a range of personalities and challenges.  One of the many lessons I learned was that most kids (as well as adults) respond well to personal attention, a lesson I will keep in mind as a physician.  The tragedies in our life are often our educators as well.  In 2006, my Aunt Sue, who lived next door to us as I grew up, developed colon cancer.  She and her kids were always next door, and I thought that would never change, especially with the careful attention of my father as her family physician and the specialists he had recommended.  Her death a year later, taught me some hard, but valuable lessons.  I learned that even with the remarkable advances we have made in science and medicine, there are those people that a physician cannot cure, no matter how expertly trained he/she is or how hard he/she tries.  Two years later, I was having trouble deciding on a project for my biochemistry class.  The assignment involved writing a proposal for a research project to develop a novel treatment for a disease of our choosing.  Being ambitious and inspired by my Aunt Sue, I proposed a novel treatment for cancer.  The treatment was a telomerase inhibitor (a sequence-specific DNA analog), which could possibly be used in conjunction with other chemotherapy agents to slow the progress of a wide variety of telomerase-expressing malignant neoplasms. The project impressed my professor, and also suggested to me that perhaps I should consider pursuing biomedical research instead of clinical medicine.  Throughout college, I maintained an interest in both research and clinical medicine.  Both fields appealed to me as meaningful and exciting ways to make a difference in the lives of others.  I have always enjoyed the thrill of discovery, seeking out elective classes such as Innovations in Bio-Research.  This past summer, I enjoyed running reactions in the lab, coupling amino acids into dipeptides as part of an organic chemistry research project about amino acids, chirality, and the origins of life.  In my first year at college, I read a quotation in the Atlantic Monthly from Dr. J. Craig Venter, who worked on the Human Genome project, A doctor can save maybe a few hundred lives in a lifetime, a researcher can save the whole world.  Truly, advances in medicine would not be possible without the multitudes of dedicated researchers that tirelessly push the boundaries of our knowledge.  Still, these medical advances would be in vain if it were not for the doctors and other healthcare professionals that use these advances to care for the individual patients.  This human side of healing calls me to pursue a career in medicine, because a researcher looks to cure a disease, while a clinician looks to cure a person.  I have learned a great deal through the different educators in my life--from teachers, life experiences, volunteer and work opportunities, and observing my father.  Looking ahead, continuing education is an important aspect of medicine that I will embrace.  I still have much to learn and I look forward to the challenge. Boone County Parks Department As Summer Staff for the Parks Department, I worked for four summers leading/teaching kids programs in a range of areas, such as beginner's golf, games and crafts, tee ball, dodgeball, frisbee golf, and sports fundamentals. I was responsible for planning activities, bringing equipment, and leading the program. I also assisted in Parks sponsored events, such as Arboretum Day, Concerts at Creekside, Family Fun Nights, the Jack-O-Lantern Walk, and Fishing Derbies.  I was often responsible for insuring these events ran smoothly, which required coordination of groups of workers and adherence to the event plan., Chemical Rubber Company First Year Chemistry Award Award given to top first-year chemistry student, based on standardized test provided by the American Chemical Society along with student's final grades in General Chemistry I and II., Children of the Americas Service Project Children of the Americas (COTA) organizes medical mission trips to Central and South Amerca.  On these trips they host free medical clinics, performing surgeries and medical care for locals who would otherwise not have access this. I and other Transylvania students packaged medical supplies for the CODA trip to Guatemala., Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity Delta Sigma Phi is a social fraternity, whose motto is better men, better lives, which signifies their dedication to self improvement and helping each other to reach their full potential, which is important to me.  This organization is service oriented, participating in several service events each year. Some of the service events I have participated in this year include: planting trees at Reforest the Bluegrass, picking up litter in the Great American Clean Up, and organizing donations at the Catholic Action Center in Lexington., Organic Chemistry Research For three weeks, I participated in an organic chemistry project investigating amino acids, chirality, and the origins of life. Amino acids are chiral molecules. Almost all biological systems use only the levorotary (L) configuration of amino acids. This implies that the first lifeforms incorporated these L-amino acids. This research aims to explain why the first lifeforms would favor L-amino acids over the other configuration. My objective in this research was to run coupling reactions to form dipeptides from free amino acids and analyze the products via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. So, most of my time was spent at the lab bench or on the NMR computer., William T. Young Scholar Highest scholarship/award given to an incoming student at Transylvania based on academic record, two separate essays and an interview., American Chemical Society I am serving as Treasurer during the 2009 - 2010 academic year. I participated in various events, including Science Day, where local middle school children visited Transylvania University and the students and faculty had various demonstrations and displays.  I also attended many lectures sponsored by this organization., Biology Club I have been a charter member of this club since it was established my first-year at Transylvania.  I encourage recruitment of incoming freshmen into this club each year.  The Biology Club hosts many lectures each year. Some of the lectures I attended include Bats of Kentucky, Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, and Careers in Biology., Trany LEAD I participated in this annual event on Transylvania University's campus, where students and faculty are invited to listen to lectures and participate in activities aimed at improving leadership skills.  These workshops helped hone my leadership skills., Phi Delta Epsilon Medical Fraternity I served as Vice President of Recruitment/Membership during the 2008-2009 school year. Phi Delta Epsilon Medical Fraternity hosts lectures, sponsors service events, and provides other opportunities for members to prepare for a career in medicine. Some of the lectures I have attended include: Why Should you be a Doctor with Dr. Jamshed Kanga, Getting into Medical School with Dr. Lowell Katz, and Searching for Adult Stem Cells in the Nose with Dr. Fred Roisen. Some of the opportunities provided by Phi Delta Epsilon to help pre-health students include hosting a practice MCAT/DAT at Transylvania and hosting several medical school admissions staff to come for Meet & Greet type events., Physician Shadowing I was able to spend most of the day with Dr. Horn as he made rounds and performed an endoscopy.  This afforded me the opportunity to discuss his medical career as a gastroenterologist as well as his undergrad and medical school experiences., Family Physician Shadowing On multiple occasions I have shadowed my father.  This would include spending the night at the hospital in the resident's call room, shadowing him at his office, shadowing him on rounds at the hospital, and treating friends and relatives at our house or theirs., Transylvania Classics Club Student organization dedicated to celebrating classical history (mainly, ancient Greek and Roman history). In this group, I attended Classics Club sponsored lectures and participated in group discussions about classical history., Volunteer at St. Elizabeth Medical Center The activities I was permitted to do while volunteering at St. Elizabeth Medical Center included: aiding in the transport of patients withing the hospital, checking expiration dates on drugs in the pharmacy, checking nurses' stations with pharmacy technicians, and on occasion preparing solutions for IVs.  Additionally, I was able to provide cheerful interaction with the patients I was in contact with., Natural Science and Mathematics Tutor Transylvania University employed me to tutor fellow students in science and mathematics. Tutors are selected for their academic excellence. During my two years of tutoring, I have tutored in the areas of biology, chemistry, physics, and calculus.  Tutoring has allowed me to review a lot of material in science and math, as well as improve my ability to explain topics in these subjects."

    "text": "I used to be afraid of change; but I have learned that it is change that propels us forward along our own unique and individual journey.  It is change that leads to a life that is dynamic, expectant, and never complacent.  I once heard someone say that this kind of change is a shift in what we think we are capable of, in where we want to see our lives heading, and in how we are willing to spend our time, talents, and resources.   The experiences that compel me to make a change in the direction I'm taking are those that have impacted my point of view and impressed themselves upon my heart.  When I think back to all of the moments that have influenced the way I view my life, the image that first comes to mind is one from the summer I spent as an intern with Back2Back Ministries in Mexico.  It is a memory that has led me to change my future career path in order to pursue medicine.              The scene burned into my memory is impoverished and unsightly.  When I take a closer look, I see beauty.  As I walk down an uneven dirt road, with rusty tin cans and rotten fruit littering the ground in front of me, children run bare foot in and out of the tin-roofed shacks they call home.  I feel slightly uncomfortable.  I stop at each house, speaking with families in Spanish, and extend invitations for them to come up the street for comida gratis (free food).  As I slowly walk back towards the rest of the group, I peer through the doorway of one of the homes I pass.  Most people probably would not give a second thought to what I see inside, but it brings tears to my eyes.  I look in and see a woman in a ragged old dress, with beads of sweat appearing on her forehead as she sweeps her dirt floor.  I notice she's growing flowers in old tin cans in the windowsill.  She doesn't have much, but what she does have she takes care of with pride.  What impacts me most about her is that in the midst of her circumstances, she is striving to live a life of dignity by finding beauty in a rather desolate place.  That summer in Mexico, I met countless others like her.  She was among an army of people stuck in shanty-town communities, which are viewed as eyesores to be removed and forgotten.  I spent time with teenage girls who were abandoned at an orphanage.  While it would have been easy to gravitate towards laughing children whose affection was easily won through a piggyback ride or a hug, I challenged myself by choosing to interact with the older girls.  Finally seeing a smile on the face of a girl I'd tried for days to have a conversation with made all the extra effort worthwhile.  The individuals I met showed me that it isn't the geography of the landscape, the architecture of the buildings, or anything money can buy that makes a place beautiful.  It is the people.  These were my defining moments, and I knew right then that my life was meant to be spent loving people, and working to the best of my ability to directly impact the lives of many in a tangible way.  While I recognize that one standard of living cannot be attained by all people, I desire to live out my conviction that every individual deserves to be afforded the basic needs and comforts necessary to living life with dignity.        As I climbed onto the bus at the end of that summer in Mexico, and got comfortable in my seat, my gaze swept past an empty building still under construction.  I didn't think much of it until two years later, when I picked up a newsletter from Back2Back Ministries, and learned that the empty building was a brand new medical clinic.  The only problem was that there were no doctors to fill it.  Something tugged at my heart.  One of the lingering questions of my life became clear.  For the past two years I had struggled with thoughts about the future, because my childhood dream of becoming a veterinarian no longer resonated within my heart.  I couldn't let go of my love of medicine, but being a veterinarian no longer fit.  Those defining moments in Mexico had instilled in me a deep passion to work with people, and to meet real human need.  In one of those rare moments when all the fragmented pieces of dreams and ideas suddenly fall into place, I knew in my heart that I wanted to become a physician.    I want to study medicine so that I can fulfill my life's purpose: to love people not just with words or good intentions, but through my actions, providing them with the medical care I believe every person deserves to receive.  What excites me most is the privilege of being able to meet a universal need, because people do not deserve to be treated as problems to be solved, but as human beings worthy of dignity and respect.  The need for health care, so poignantly revealed through the scrapes and cuts on the feet of children running through piles of rotting garbage, is also found right here in my own community.  My eyes are being opened to the realization that while I may not be able to heal all the sickness in the world, I can commit my life to the field of medicine and make a difference. University Honors Program After being accepted into the Honors Program, I fulfilled the requirements for all Honors courses.  These classes provided the opportunity for more one-on-one interaction with professors and fellow honors students, which created a learning environment that stimulated deeper engagement with the course-work.  Extra assignments and more in-depth study of the material made the honors program a valuable part of my undergraduate education.  In addition, I made the President's list for obtaining a 4.0 GPA during the following semesters: First Semester 2007-08, Second Semester 2007-08, and First Semester 2008-09.  I made the Dean's list for the First and Second Semesters of 2006-07, and the Second Semester of 2008-09., Oxford Veterinary Hospital volunteer As a student volunteer, I assisted with helping the clinic to run smoothly in order to provide quality care to all clients.  This included cleaning, organizing paperwork and patient files, setting up lab samples, preparing vaccines and prescriptions, and assisting with animal handling.  I was also able to directly shadow Dr. Reagh, which provided me the opportunity to engage in conversation with him, and to ask pertinent questions in order to learn medicine through direct observation and interaction with a doctor., Student Leadership Team As one of twenty students in charge of giving leadership and direction to a student organization of around 700 students, I have learned what it means to step up and lead by example- not just through planning and coordinating events and weekly activities, but through my lifestyle and interactions with people on a daily basis.  Weekly leadership team meetings provide an opportunity to interact and communicate with other leaders in order to discuss goals, address problems or conflicts, and plan and coordinate meetings and events for the entire organization.  I had the opportunity to plan a session for our fall conference, and to step out of my comfort zone by serving as the main speaker on stage in front of a large audience.  My leadership and communication skills have been further developed through leading a weekly bible study, mentoring younger students on a regular basis, and meeting with new students interested in involvement in the organization., Health Care Education Class for the Latino Community As part of an independent study, I attended a health education class for Hispanic women every week.  My goal was to assess and evaluate the health care experience of the Latino community in the area.  I was able to sit in on the class discussions throughout the semester, and to conduct both a survey and personal interviews in Spanish with the class participants.  I concluded the experience by writing a reflection paper on my observations of the struggles faced by the Latina women participating in the class  in getting access to health care.  This revealed the need within the community for an increased awareness about how to obtain access to health care.  A major barrier for members of the community to overcome is the lack of knowledge about where to go to receive primary care, how to develop a payment plan and obtain financial assistance, and how to communicate in spite of the language barrier.  I created a brochure in Spanish that provides basic information to address these barriers.  I then wrote a proposal for which I received university funding to design and print a thousand copies of the brochure, which are to be distributed within the city of Hamilton, Ohio., Shadowing at Crossroad Health Clinic Crossroad is an urban clinic in Cincinnati that provides health care to an under-served population.  The majority of patients are those with lower income.  I was able to observe Dr. Schubert, a pediatrician, for four hours in January of 2009, and Nurse Practitioner Brooke Gumm for four hours in June of 2009.  This provided me with a glimpse of how such a clinic is run, and I was able to see the way in which each patient was treated with dignity and respect, regardless of social, ethnic or economic status.  It was inspiring and educational to spend time in a clinic that provides health care for the whole person, taking into account the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of each person's life.  No one is turned away, regardless of their ability to pay.  It is the type of clinic in which I could easily see myself working someday, and the doctors who work there all express great satisfaction with what they do every day., Mallory Wilson Center Medical Preceptorship I shadowed orthopedic surgeon Dr. Thomas Loeb every day for one week.  Not only this, but I was able to stay with Dr. Loeb and his family, which provided a truly in-depth and realistic look at what life as a physician like.  Observing in the operating room revealed the importance of team-work and precise communication between the surgeon, nurses, technicians and assistants.  Watching Dr. Loeb perform numerous operations gave me an up-close look at what it takes to remain calm under pressure in order to solve  problems.  While seeing patients in his office, I learned about the need to spend time with each patient while working quickly and effectively in order to see up to 40 patients in a day.  I also learned about the task of keeping meticulous records, which is another aspect of effective communication.  I experienced what it looks like to see patients over a wide range of ages, and at all different stages of treatment ranging from preventative care to post-operation and recovery.  It was significant for me to talk with Dr. Loeb about the realities of medicine, including the cost of running a practice, the challenge of finding  balance in a time-demanding profession, and the role that physicians, hospitals, insurance companies and drug manufacturers all play in the health care system., Shadowing Dr. Donald Nofziger, Pediatrician I spent one full day shadowing Dr. Nofziger.  The hours I spent with him impacted me profoundly and provided me with a real-life example of the kind of primary care physician that I aspire to become.  He taught me that a physician is a teacher, and that the role of a primary care physician includes treating the whole patient.  This is done by communicating not only with the patient but also with all specialists providing care, in order to ensure that the overall well-being of the patient is kept as a priority.  In the midst of discussing with patients issues  such as the treatment options for chronic asthma or the appropriate product to prevent diaper rash, Dr. Nofziger also took the time to talk with children and parents about eating healthy foods, and having a positive body image and high self-esteem.  He also promoted abstinence and working hard in school.  He is a doctor who cares about every aspect of his patients' lives, including their physical, mental and emotional health.  His practice serves a diverse patient-base, offering care to children of all different cultural, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds.  This was very appealing to me, as I am most interested in serving this type of population., International Summer Project I spent seven weeks in Mexico traveling to universities in three different cities.  As a leader for my team, I was responsible for arranging our lodging and transportation, along with leading team meetings and developing a schedule to plan and fulfill our goals for each new city.  Our purpose was to meet with Mexican students to discuss culture, religion, and student life in order to learn from each other in a cultural immersion experience.  We also met with students interested in starting their own chapter of Campus Crusade for Christ on their campuses, training and equipping them with information and materials for initiating weekly meetings, bible studies, and student activities.  We were also able to serve alongside of the students to volunteer at local non-profit organizations such as an orphanage, a soup kitchen, and the Red Cross., Colerain Animal Clinic employee I spent three summers working at the clinic, for a total of three months in 2006, two months in 2007, and two months in 2008.  Working in a clinic that provides service to a large percentage of lower income clients provided me with experience working with an under-served client base.  My responsibilities included relaying instructions to patients, answering phone calls, and assisting in surgical and medical procedures.  I also monitored hourly treatments for in-hospital patients, including drawing blood and administering vaccines and fluids.  Being assigned to one veterinarian to assist and work alongside of developed the communication skills necessary to carry out doctors' instructions and to relay them to patients.  My experience interacting with clients to explain and educate them on pet health care, and to resolve any of their complaints or concerns, enabled me to practice my ability to communicate effectively.  In addition, daily discussions with doctors about diagnoses and treatment options stimulated my fascination with medicine and instilled in me an understanding of what it means to think on my feet., Spanish interpreter I translated for and taught English to two native Spanish speakers staying with Dr. and Mrs. Molnar while in the U.S. for medical treatment.  In doing so, I was able to help them to adjust to life in the U.S. and to become acclimated to everyday life in the home in which they were staying.  Through building a relationship with them and providing a means for them to communicate with their hosts, I was able to help them to bridge the cultural gap they faced in order for them to make their needs known and to understand what was going on around them., Summer Internship My role as an intern for the month of July meant getting up early and working hard all day to serve in the orphanages and poor villages of Monterrey, Mexico.  I was responsible for preparing and directing daily service projects, which included  concrete pours, painting ceilings, cooking and serving free meals, and organizing crafts and games for children.  As an intern, my role was to lead these daily projects for a new team of people coming down from the U.S. each week, and to assist the Back2Back staff in communicating with the groups and making sure that all of their needs were met., Shadowing Dr. Jennifer Messer, MD Observing Dr. Messer  for two days revealed to me the relationship a family physician has with patients, doctors, and clinical staff.  In interacting with her patients, Dr. Messer is compassionate and considerate, listening attentively to everything they share with her.  She asks pertinent questions to help in making her diagnoses, taking into account each patient's different life circumstances.  By spending an adequate amount of time with each patient, Dr. Messer makes each one feel valued and respected.  At the same time, she is able to set boundaries in order to make the most of the time she has, making it clear that every single complaint cannot always be fixed in one visit.  She says that her patients understand when she runs behind, because they value the fact that she gives each one the amount of time needed to ensure that they receive quality care.  I also observed the importance of good communication with the staff and with other doctors.  This creates a mutual respect that enables doctors and staff to work together to best care for each patient.  Through talking with her, I learned about the pros and cons of family medicine and the reality of being both a physician and a mother.  She is left with only a few hours a day with her children, but is committed to both her children and her patients., Shadowing Dr. James Molnar, Anesthesiologist Spending one eight-hour day with Dr. Molnar in his pain management practice provided me with a glimpse into a field of medicine that I didn't have any previous knowledge of.  It was fascinating to hear him talk about the unique challenges presented by a specialty in which the primary symptom, pain, is so subjective.  As he says, it's not something that always shows up on an MRI or X-ray.  Communication is thus critical in treating his patients, since he relies upon descriptions and perceptions of pain that are different for each individual.  I learned about a more mechanistic medical approach that seeks to manage the symptoms and the pain, rather than to eliminate the source of pain, since most of the patients who walk into his clinic have already tried numerous other treatments.  His methods for managing pain range from nerve blocks and surgically inserted nerve stimulators to physical therapy, muscle relaxers and pain killers.  What impacted me most from the hours I spent in his clinic was the loyalty and respect his patients have for him.  Almost every patient we saw talked about what a difference Dr. Molnar has made in their lives, and none of them would choose to go anywhere else.  He is a doctor who makes his patients feel known and understood, and who treats each one as an individual., Member of Miami University's Campus Crusade for Christ The time and effort I've put into being a dedicated participant in this student organization have shaped my college experience and the person I am today.  Through weekly meetings, small group bible study, and meeting each week with a mentor, along with special events such as a fall retreat and a regional conference with schools all over the Mid-West, I have grown in my ability to communicate with others in a way that is genuine and real.  I have learned what it means to live in community with other people, and to continuously grow and develop both my personal faith and character.  I have been challenged to examine who I am and what I believe, and to continuously reflect upon my personal growth and seek to keep learning., Medical Spanish Course Two weeks of intensive study of medical Spanish in the classroom setting will be followed by two weeks of hands on experience and cultural immersion in a hospital affiliated with the School of Medicine.  I will be able to interact with patients and to directly observe physicians in the hospital.  This will enable me to apply the language and communication skills learned in the classroom, and to learn about the Mexican health care system.  As an extension of my study of the health care experience of Latinos living in Butler county, Ohio, I will be documenting all experiences as part of an individual study through the Miami University Honors program.  The goal of this study will be to evaluate and compare the health care experiences of people living in Guadalajara, Mexico, and of Mexican immigrants living in Butler county."

    "text": "Ever since I can remember, I have been exposed to the field of medicine.  I remember playing with the tongue depressors and spending time with my grandfather and the nurses that worked with him at his pediatrics office in Chillicothe, Ohio.  It is through him that my interest in medicine was initially sparked, and that interest stayed with me until I decided that medicine was truly what I wanted to do.  My other grandfather was also a physician, specializing in primary care for older patients and advising medical professionals on Native American reservations. He is now my greatest source of advice and encouragement in my pursuit of a career in medicine.  My uncle, whom I have shadowed on multiple occasions, worked for ten years as a physician in the emergency room before practicing primary care at the Urgent Care Centers around Central Ohio and eventually opening his own practice.  I feel a great sense of pride and accomplishment with the opportunity to join them as the fourth doctor in my immediate family.  The past year especially has been a very challenging and maturing one for me.  I married my wife Emily August 1, 2009 and we moved to Washington D.C. two weeks later.  The Capital is a very different place than either of us with our small-town-Ohio background is used to.  Living in this city has been a truly enlightening experience for both of us.  D.C. is a very expensive place to live, and being on our own and trying to pay the bills while both of us are in school has been a struggle.  For most of my time here I have worked 72 hour work weeks with no days off while keeping up with my studies at the same time.  While that was certainly an exhausting challenge, it has forced me to learn how to better manage my time, how to work harder even when I am already tired, and how to constantly be looking for ways to move forward.  I know that this kind of effort is similar to the sort of schedule necessary for any physician in training, and I feel more prepared now than ever for the rigors of medical school and beyond.   Completing the clinical laboratory science program at George Washington University and working at GWU Hospital has been a better experience than I could have ever hoped for.  It has certainly been the most important step in my pursuit of a career in medicine so far.  It has been a perfect way to combine my love of laboratory work with my interest in the practical medical field.  Through working in the clinical laboratory at GWUH I have personally run hundreds of different diagnostic tests for patients from all different backgrounds.  D.C. and the unique diversity and travels of its population present a particularly challenging environment for medicine.  I even had the chance to identify a parasitic infection in a patient who had recently been to Madagascar that many of the doctors at GWUH had never seen before.  I have learned the method, purpose, and significance of nearly every common laboratory test performed in a hospital, and I know that this knowledge will be extremely valuable as a medical student.  Working in the clinical lab has re-affirmed my passion for medicine and encouraged me to push my career further.  By the time I hope to enter medical school in fall 2011, my wife will have finished her graduate studies at GW, and I will have gained the financial security and experience of more than a year of work as a medical technologist.  This will allow me to confidently devote myself to the study of medicine.  I am very glad to have spent two years following my undergraduate education to better myself and increase my potential as a medical student.  I know that next fall will be the perfect time for me to begin medical school, and I am excited to finally begin my formal education to be a physician.  Barista,  Clinical Laboratory Scientist, Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity Eleven men including myself were chosen to re-found Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity after the National Fraternity decided to close their chapter on Miami's campus in 2002.  I held the office of New Member Educator for the first term and Risk Management Officer for the second term.  Re-founding the chapter required a lot of work from all of us, especially on a campus that already has 30 other general Fraternity organizations. As of April 2009 we have 40 active students in our chapter, and have just regained our official charter from our national fraternity.  LCA, though a social extracurricular organization, is devoted to developing college men of strong character and merit.  We as a chapter have consistently ranked in the top three fraternities on campus by average GPAs, and this past November we collected 15,000 lbs. of food for the community food pantry during our national philanthropy, The North American Food Drive.  Academics and service are only two of the values we seek to foster in our members, and we all feel that LCA has played an important role in our growth into the best men we can be., Shadowing Medical/Clinical I spent one week in August shadowing and working at my uncle's clinic, Immigration Medical, and at the nearby Ohio Health branch, shadowing the doctors, nurses, and medical assistants.  During that week, the nurses and medical assistants taught me how to give subdermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular injections, draw blood samples, place I.V.s, and take proper blood pressure and heart rate readings. The medical assistants were kind enough to allow me to practice on them until I demonstrated proficiency in all these techniques.  I used this intensive week of experience to talk with several physicians at the Ohio Health branch about their medical careers as well as many of the nurses and assistants about their daily activities at the clinic., Teaching Assistant BOT 244 I was given the opportunity to be a teaching assistant for Mr. Keegan for his BOT 244: Viticulture and Enology class for both semesters during my senior year at Miami.  I have always been interested in wine both for its interesting science and its incredible variety and complexity as a product and hobby.  I took the class the previous semester and am effectively reviewing the course twice through my work this year.  My duties for the class include assisting Mr. Keegan in the lecture portion of the course, facilitating the tasting portion of the course, and informally discussing the topics of the lecture and tastings with the students.  During the summer following my graduation I plan to take the Certified Specialist of Wine examination offered by the Society of Wine Educators.  I hope to use this certification to work part-time in a specialty wine shop.  I enjoy introducing people to the wonderful world of wine, and I believe it has so much to offer in international culture, unique personal enjoyment, and even chemical complexity for those of us obsessed with science., Medical Technologist II - GWU Hospital I was given the opportunity to work at GWUH after completing most of my practical rotations for clinical laboratory science. The techs at GWUH all were excellent instructors and I learned an enormous amount of useful techniques and information from them in a very short time. I demonstrated proficiency in every rotation and a talent for learning laboratory protocol quickly, and was offered the chance to apply for a PRN position in the Pathology department. My position initially has included 10 to 20 hours per week working in the Hematology, Chemistry, and Microbiology areas of the laboratory during the overnight shift. Once I complete the CLS program at GW on August 4th, I will be transferred to full time covering the overnight shifts, which I will continue until I enter medical school. This work has allowed me to gain significant clinical experience while performing laboratory work I enjoy, using all the academic knowledge I have gained over the last five years in a very real and professional environment. Working at GWUH has allowed me to work along side a great variety of medical professionals, from nurses to medical students to expert pathologists. Through my experience with GWUH, I have learned so much more about how the medical field works, and I am extremely grateful to have had this opportunity., Biochemistry and Microbiology Lab Research The goal of my research with Dr. Hawes was to isolate and characterize a novel enzyme cloned from Haemophilus influenzae. This enzyme is from a class of enzymes known as beta-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases. These enzymes are thought to manipulate carbonyl and hydroxyl groups using threonine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and other similar three and four-carbon compounds as substrates. These enzymes are encoded by genes that are expressed only under certain conditions, and are thought to play a role in the utilization of atypical carbon sources that allow the bacteria to survive in stressed environments. Dr. Hawes has performed and published research isolating and describing these enzymes and the genes encoding them, but further study of their activity, structure, and specificity was needed and was the subject of our research. With complete characterization of the active site of these enzymes we may be able to harness their mechanism for medical, industrial, and ecological applications. I enjoyed this research because it combined my interest in microbiology with my love for biochemical laboratory work. The dual nature of this research allowed me an opportunity to use a broad range of chemistry and microbiology laboratory techniques and equipment that I would have never had in a strictly one-discipline laboratory., Information Systems Maintenance This job included maintaining, repairing, upgrading, and installing the computer information systems at M/I Homes Corporate office and for private customers. I learned technical computer skills on my own and I've always had a love for computers and technology. Before M/I, I fixed home computers on my own for friends. The IT staff at M/I taught me how to maintain business computer systems along with a host of other computer and networking skills that I could not learn through my own study. After M/I, I continued to service computer systems both on my own and employed with smaller private computer repair firms. My employment at M/I Homes and elsewhere allowed me to work directly alongside a wide range of professionals including IT, sales, financial, legal, and executive professionals. Interacting with these people while I fixed their computers allowed me to see what many of their careers included. Many of them also knew my father (who was employed with M/I for 15 years), and were happy to show me what their part of M/I was like. This gave me exposure to many different career paths and allowed me to make a more informed decision about what I want to do with my life."

    "text": "In one examination room, a patient yelps in pain as the doctor palpates his abdomen, and an assistant calmly reassures him everything is going to be ok.  In the other exam room, a whole family of young patients awaits the doctor for their annual vaccinations, while an assistant plays games with them.  In the back room, an assistant is developing radiographs, with the patient and their loved ones await results up front.  Meanwhile at the reception desk, three different people are picking up prescriptions.  I have experienced a similar scene every week I have worked at Glencoe Animal Hospital, having been in the position of each staff member many times.  Each shift is exhilarating, and as the medical cases unfold, I get to experience the entire diagnostic process.  I witness and help Dr. Gibson gather information, analyze it, make a diagnosis, and initiate a treatment plan.  This experience has reaffirmed my passion for human medicine, and has been a key influence on my premedical experience. \t When I started working at Glencoe Animal Hospital, I had no idea the journey I would be taking over the course of the next year.  Up until that point, my desire to become a physician had been unwavering.  However, I knew I loved animals, I knew I loved medicine, and for me that was enough to want to delve further into the field of veterinary medicine before committing myself to human medicine.  At first, I was in awe at the amount I could do as a student worker; I found myself giving injections, running lab tests, and even assisting in surgeries before the end of a few months.  My passion for medicine kept me going, and I quickly became a very trusted and well-respected staff member.  However, I always felt that there was something missing.  As we went through appointments, I found myself asking how this disease would present, and how treatment dosages would differ in people rather than dogs or cats.  I would think back to my volunteer experiences at Ohio State, wondering if patients I had seen in the ER or in the catheterization lab had similar issues as the animal patients, comparing the treatments.  There was a special connection I felt with human patients that I found missing in the dogs and cats I worked with.  I knew that I could not fulfill my desire to heal without the human connection between patient and doctor.  What drives me is the human spirit.  Humans have so much to offer this world, and to each other.  I want to change the life of patients by improving their quality of life so that they may in turn go on and help others.  While I love and care for animals in many ways, I know in my heart that human potential is my motivation, and my desire to heal goes towards people.  Aside from my job at Glencoe, there have been several other experiences which I believe have prepared me well for medicine.  My experiences performing biochemistry research have also been a major influence on my goal to become a physician.  In Dr. Ottesen's lab, study of the particular modification I have worked on, phosphorylation of T118 on histone H3, may provide insight as to how nucleosomes and chromatin assemble or disassemble.  This has huge implications for DNA replication and repair, which in turn have huge implications for cancer, as malfunctions in DNA replication or repair are carcinogenic.  Although I do basic research, far from a cure to cancer in itself, I have found great motivation in my work, knowing that someday my findings could lead to cancer treatment or prevention.  My commitment to research has led me to compete and win at university poster sessions, as well as to complete a senior honors thesis, allowing me to graduate with distinction in biochemistry.  Through research, I have also developed problem solving and analytical skills that will serve me well as a physician.  My work depends on being able to identify, determine the cause, and fix a problem in any given experiment, likely multiple times, much like the diagnostic process in a medical case.  Furthermore, I am constantly in a leadership role, with teaching undergraduate and rotating graduate students a regular responsibility of mine.  These skills will serve me well as a physician, as analytical thought and leadership have become an essential part of me. \t Despite my somewhat unusual path, I have returned to my dreams of becoming a physician, and improving human lives through preventing and battling disease.  The lessons I learned working in veterinary medicine will prove to be invaluable aspects of my premedical education.  By working with animal models, I have actively participated in many procedures that no human hospital could ever allow.  Through my biochemistry research, I have also gained the analytical and leadership skills needed to successfully practice medicine.  My strong conviction towards helping people has led me straight back to human medicine, where I can truly use my skills to their fullest potential to save lives. Biochemistry Club Vice President As Vice President of the Biochemistry Club at OSU I helped plan events, such as trips to local biochemistry research centers, social events, and community service events.  We also set up study groups for Biochemistry major courses., American Peptide Society Symposium I attended and presented a poster at the 2009 American Peptide Society Symposium at Indiana University.  I attended serveral presentations over the week, in addition to presenting my poster to peptide researchers from all over the world.  As this was a one-week event, the 40 hours per week pertains to that week only., Research Assistant I currently work as a research technician for the Ottesen Lab in the Department of Biochemistry, where I did my undergraduate research work.  I am continuing with the project that I started as an undergraduate, and have additional repsonsibilities, such as ordering lab supplies, keeping track of MSDS, writing SOPs, and cleaning.  Additionally, I train new members of the lab in lab protocol and techniques.  Skills I utilize include running SDS-PAGE gels, running native gels, solid phase peptide synthesis, growing and harvesting bacterial cell culture, HPLC and FPLC ion exchange and gel filtration and protein purification, PCR, restriction enzyme digests, enzyme digests, image analysis using ImageQuant 5.2, and more.  I also give quarterly presentations for our group meetings, in which I present my research or analyze the research of another related group., BMPS Undergraduate Research Forum I presented a poster of my undergraduate research at OSU at the Biological, Mathematical, and Physical Sciences Undergraduate Reserach forum.  I was judged by two faculty members, and was awarded as an outstanding poster.  As this was a one-time presentation, the 5 hours a week pertains to the time spent at the forum on that day., Denman Undergraduate Research Forum I presented a poster summarizing my research that I had done as an undergraduate at this forum, which showcased over 500 presenters this year.  I was judged by 3 faculty members, I won second place in the Biological Sciences category at this event.  As this was a one-time event, the 8 hours per week pertains to the time spent at the forum on that day., TA for General Chemistry I served as the lab and/or recitation TA for Chemistry 121, 122, and 123 general chemistry courses at OSU; this was a paid position.  I taught the lab and recitation portions of the class for sections of 25 students (one or two per quarter).  My duties included grading lab reports and quizzes, proctoring exams, attending lectures, leading class each week, demonstrating correct laboratory techniques, attending weekly TA meetings, leading review sessions for exams, holding regular office hours, and answering student questions outside of class., Club Secretary I served as the secretary for the Veggie Club at OSU.  Our purpose as a club was to promote vegetarianism amongst the students at OSU by providing a place for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike to eat together and discuss relevant issues.  We would also go volunteer as a group at Food Not Bombs and the Cat Welfare Society., Veterinary Assistant I started working at Glencoe Animal Hospital in order to gain some experience and insight into the field of veterinary medicine.  As a regular staff member, my duties include holding animals during examination and treatment, helping prepare animals for surgical procedures, assisting the doctor during surgical procedures, assisting/holding the patient while taking radiographs, caring for and administering medications and/or fluids to boarding patients,  running in-house lab tests (e.g. ELISA SNAP tests, fecal smears, Loeffler's ear swabs, urinalysis, developing radiographs), cleaning the hospital, stocking shelves, helping write up medical records, filing medical records, checking out clients, filling prescriptions, educating clients, checking and mailing reminders to clients., Honors Thesis Presentation In order to graduate With Distinction in Biochemistry, I completed a honors thesis, summarizing my work in the Ottesen Lab over the past year.  I then defended my thesis as an oral presentation in front of a 3-member faculty committee., Undergraduate Research Starting as a part of Biochemistry H201, I joined the Ottesen Lab to perform undergraduate research.  I immediately began working on an independent project, studying the effects of phosphorylation of histone H3 at T118 via creation of a semi-synthetic protein using expressed protein ligation, and I am still continuting this project.  This research experience has allowed me to apply my classroom knowledge of biochemical principles and techniques.  I also have had the opportunity to mentor younger undergraduate students in the lab.  I also have had the opportunity to present my research at departmental talks (in June 2008 and November 2008), as well as at poster sessions at research forums.  My work in the lab was the basis for my senior honors thesis, which was completed in June prior to my graduation.  Starting in January 2009, I was paid for part of my hours working in the lab, and recieved class credit for the other part., Cashier This job was as a cashier at a natural foods store.  I greeted customers, rang up purchases, organized and cleaned the store.  This job ended when the company went out of business, as I worked there until the store closed., Student Volunteer Volunteering at University Hospital gave me experience working in a hospital setting.  Positions that I held included 4th floor surgery waiting room attendant, where I tended to the family members of patients in surgery, answered phones, and kept the waiting room running.  Another position I worked was the Dispatch position, where, with another volunteer, we answered calls from hospital staff in order to discharge patients, transport patients to different locations within the hospital, transport medical records, deliver mail, sell newspapers, transport lab samples, or refill supplies.  Another position I held was as an ER volunteer attendant, where I helped check in patients at the triage desk in the ER.  Finally, the last position I held was as an observer in the catheterization lab in the Ross, where I observed catheterization procedures."

    "text": "I have desired to be a doctor since before high school. Initially inspired by my own mothers work as a physician I became impressed by the profession and decided to pursue it as a serious interest. I strove to spend time with doctors and familiarize myself with medicine, and my subsequent experiences only fed my interest. In an inner-city safety-net hospital where I realized a summer-long research project not only did I do the work of designing, proposing and carrying out a research study, but was able to see how my mentors in the project used medicine to combat the cycles of poverty by working to prevent lead-poisoning of disadvantaged children. Their example showed that good medicine and a true concern for patients can make a lifelong, multigenerational difference.  As a Peace Corps volunteer in community health in rural Ecuador I am intimately involved in managing the wellbeing of communities of hundreds of residents who depend on a team of 5 people for medical care. In working in the community and alongside the parish doctor, nurse, dentist, and nurses aide I constantly have to strategize and plan how we are to overcome problems such as landslides, medicine shortages, and deficient communication networks to bring care to everyone. The responsibility placed on each one of us is great. Just as great is the recognition that the whole team, respectfully working together as individuals and as an institution, can make a real difference in the lives of the local people, in spite of differences in income, education, or culture. Instances such as these have inspired me to follow medicine and improve peoples quality of life through dedicated, caring practice. Just as importantly my years of study in college made it clear that I am interested in and capable of the scientific work involved in medicine. Managing the academic rigor of my biology major, as well as classes for the University of Vermonts honors program was a significant challenge all four years. From studying the biochemistry of Lesch-Nyhans syndrome to the histological presentation of diseases, from reading about research process and ethics, and Americas lamentable program of sterilizing defectives, I have learned about the technical as well as the social elements of science and medicine. Additional studies in topics such as evolution, physics, and organic chemistry made clear the breadth of the science behind modern evidence-based medicine. One thing my experiences have showed me, however, is that proficiency in the sciences is necessary but not sufficient to succeed in medicine. With America's increasingly diverse demographics being able to interact well with different groups of people is almost as important as memorizing treatments. Nowhere is this more obvious than when there is a language barrier between doctor and patient. Given that Spanish is now practically the United States second language I have made studying it a priority for nearly a decade. The challenge of becoming bilingual requires significant effort and this prompted me to take on Spanish as a second major, and to pursue senior honors in Spanish.  During a semester in Peru I not only handled an all-Spanish course load but volunteered weekly with a local NGO and familiarized myself with the many social realities of Lima and greater Peru. In the Peace Corps, as mentioned above, it has been necessary to work exclusively and accurately in Spanish in every realm of private and professional life, including the medical field. I have also used my Spanish in the US, such as when my mentors for my project on lead poisoning needed me to translate for a Hispanic patient who spoke no English and did not want a phone translator. Not only was I able to put my Spanish studies into practice, but our conversation about the dangers of lead also revealed how social problems of language, poverty, and unsafe housing caused her children's poisoning. In such situations, when patients suffer from health problems complicated by issues such as low income and poor levels of education, providing meaningful care with limited time can be difficult. My work with disadvantaged populations across continents will help me to understand their needs and provide them with better care when I am a doctor. In Peru and Ecuador I have seen firsthand the extraordinary poverty that pushes millions into the US, and dangerous legal situations that can complicate medical care. In my work in the safety-net hospital as well as during tutoring at a GED agency and a high-minority school I saw the complex challenges of poverty and inadequate health coverage that many people in the US face on a daily basis. The years of study required to be a physician will prepare me to carry out the variety of tasks that comprise medicine, from ordering routine tests to fighting to save a dying patient. The commitment needed to master these skills is significant, but my academic and work performance proves that I can handle the challenges of medical school. I will expand on this record through continued study as well as cultivating new hands-on skills so that I can give effective care no matter the need.  This is what medicine is and the minimum to which I or any premedical student should aspire. Research Assistanceship at Fletcher Allen Hospital As part of the class ¨EMS Research I¨, all participating students would take shifts during the week at the Emergency Department of Fletcher Allen Hospital, Vermont´s largest care provider. As well as classwork on medical ethics and principles of statistics and writing scientific works, students worked six hours a week assisting in the Emergency Department.  Our responsibiity was to familiarize ourselves with the various studies being carried out and, in the instance that a suitable candidate entered the ED, we would use informed consent to invite them to participate in one of our studies. When there were no elligible patients, we shadowed the ED doctors on their rounds., Honors College Scholar at University of Vermont Being awarded College Honors at the University of Vermont was the culmination of my career as an Honors College student for all 4 years at the Universty of Vermont. To achieve College Honors it is required to participate in five seminar classes, attend presentations, and finally formulating, writing, and defending an honors thesis. This award was granted in conjunction with being granted Summa Cum Laude, ranking as 7 out of 1208 graduating students in GPA, Phi Beta Kappa, and being on the Dean´s List every semester of my university career., Shades of Ebony After-School Tutor During 4 semesters of my college career (one break during Fall 2009 in Peru) I served as a tutor in the Shades of Ebony tutor program. I had a group of students under my charge with whom I worked on a near-daily basis 3 to 4 days a week 1.5 hours a day after school.  I tutored in many subjects from math and science to history and Spanish. The students, who ranged from white Vermonters to African refugees from Somalia had a wide variety of academic needs. My job was to aid them with schoolwork, log their activities, and provide any advice to them during career searches., Member of University of Vermont Aikido Club During my years in college I participated actively in the martial art Aikido. I became a member immediately upon entering in 2007, and became president in the Spring 2010 semester, holding the position for a year until graduating in 2011. As a member it was necessary for me to help other members of the club in their training as I gained experience. As president I became more involved in the administration of the club, representing it on Club Sports Council, and holding primary responsibility for organizing events, writing the budget, and guiding other members in their training.  During time away from university I continued training in other parts of the US, as well as Lima, Peru., University of Vermong Learning Co-op Tutor During these months I worked as a tutor at the University of Vermont, in Biology, Chemistry, and Spanish. Tutoring was at request, in that my email was listed as available to people who desired help in a specific subject.,  Health Extension Volunteer, Teaching Medical Students to Teach I was an assistant in investigating previous literature in the field of study on student teachers. My supervisor as well as her co-authors were interested in discussing the topic of including student teaching as an element of medical school education. I searched through literature to provide information on what types of studies had already been done on this subject so that my mentors could have perspective on the scientific literature up to the present., Fulbright Scholarship In Spring 2011 I was accepted to the Fulbright program after a months-long process of applications and interviews. I applied to go to Venezuela to be an English Teaching Assistant for the period fall 2011-spring 2012. This application was carried out at the same time as my Peace Corps application and by the time the Fulbright program notified me of my being accepted, I had already been offered, and had accepted, a position in the Peace Corps. As such I had to decline the award., Factors Associated with Pediatric Lead Screening Compliance In the summer of 2010 I was selected as a Chester Summer Scholar through Case Western Reserve University and MetroHealth Medical Center. My project was to research, via medical records in the MetroHealth network, what sort of patients were more or less likely to comply when a child was ordered a blood lead test.  It was my responsibility with my mentors to formulate the study, carry out the research, and utlimately design a poster showing the results. Along with carrying out the study I was able to shadow not only my mentors in MetroHealth´s pediatric department but other departments in a safety-net medical center serving largely disadvantaged patients., Phi Beta Kappa Acceptance In winter 2010 I was accepted into Phi Beta Kappa of the University of Vermont in recognition of academic performance as well as the diversity of my classes. Induction was carried out in December with receipt of key and taking of the Phi Beta Kappa oath.,  Shades of Ebony Tutor, Community Health Peace Corps Volunteer Starting in August 2011 and continuing until the present time, I am working in the rural Ecuadorian community of Ventura in the local health clinic. I am involved in making home visits to high-risk patients, organizing events such as World AIDS Day and a town clean-up to prevent dengue, education programs, among others. The work is exclusively in Spanish and side-by-side with the parish doctor, nurse, nurse´s aide, and dentist, and two other health promotors.  At the same time I share daily life with the residents of Ventura in every way: in community events, sports gatherings, natural disasters, and much more., Young Adult Leadership Development The Young Adult Leadership Development Program is a summerlong program in which I engaged in spiritual development, non-violent conflict resolution, service participating in the Pendle Hill Community, among other activities. The primary focus of this program is to develop mature, spiritually Quaker minded leaders for the next generation of leaders of the Religious Society of Friends. As part of this opportunity I also served 10 hours a week at the Delaware County Literacy Council tutoring GED students in math. Through this partnership with the DCLC in Chester, PA and Pendle Hill I was able to provide service to the greater community to some communities with profound needs., The Novel and the Memory of the Shining Path Conflict of Per This project was my Honors Thesis to achieve College Honors at the University of Vermont. The project began with a proposal for the project in Spring 2010, and continuing research during the subsequent year. My project was to read three Peruvian novels about the aftermath of the Shining Path conflict, analyze their messages about the Shining Path´s legacy, as well as other supporting literature. Almost all literature analyzed was in Spanish, as was the final 50-page thesis and my defense before a 3-person evaluation committee., Eugenic Sterilization in 50 States This research was an investigation carried out as part of the class ¨Disability as Deviance¨ for the Universtiy of Vermont Honors College.  As well as normal classwork for the lecture, we also had a class project of creating a website with information from all 50 states of the US, and their involvement in the eugenics movement of the 20th century. Each person had to research the state, how many people were sterilized, who promoted sterilizations, and the political contraversies involved. The states I researched were Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri. This research, as well as that by other students in the class, was included in the website Eugenics: Compulsory Sterilization in 50 American States., Program Assistant at La Casa de Panchita This service was part of my semester abroad in Lima, Peru. The Institute for Study Abroad-Butler University requires that participants engage in a volunteer project, one reason I selected the program, and I decided to help in an organization that serves domestic workers. One program that the organization, La Casa de Panchita, engages in is food assistance. I evaluated how well the program works, and also if participants recieve other sources of food aid, writing a final report for IFSA-Peru at the end of my semester. This involved working at the organization´s site, as well as visiting some of Lima´s eastern slums of San Juan de Miraflores and Pamplona., Biodiesel Particle Research Assistant This was a project determining the health risks of biodiesel versus conventional fuels. My job was to  develop a method to transfer measured quantities of particles from collection pads to sterile petri dishes without introducing any kind of pyrogens, and carry out the procedure so that another laboratory could subsequently expose lung cell cultures to suspensions of the particles to determine what kind produced more damage."

    "text": "As the first person to pursue a career in medicine in my family, it took a strong will instilled by my parents to dive into a series of courses in which I didn't know what to expect. While my high school classes reflected an interest in science and medicine, its safe to say that it was my experience with viewing a surgery firsthand that piqued my interest in pursuing a career in the medical field. It was surreal to witness the inside of a living human being as the surgeon was manipulating tissue. I was lucky enough to witness this being done through the use of the da Vinci machine, a process that only further fostered my curiosity of the medical world and its processes. It was incredible to me that this surgeon and her machine could operate on this sedated woman and, in a matter of hours, that same woman would be able to wake up and continue on with her life. The entire process was extremely interesting to me. Thats all it was at that time, though; just an interest. It took time to solidify the fact that medicine was more than simply an interest and was in fact a passion. How could I be sure that dedicating my life to helping others was my calling Interest only gets one so far and pursuing medicine as a career would take a strong will and determination. A very bittersweet time in my life ensured that the medical profession was the right choice for me.   \tUntil my freshman year in college, my family was fortunate enough to not experience any deaths. It wasn't until I had my both of my grandfathers pass away from cancer within my freshman year that I could see what a loved ones death can do to a family. What I noticed throughout both of their situations, however, was that it was always the doctors involved that gave our family peace of mind in troubled times. It had meant so much to my family and to me that these doctors were doing whatever they could to help and make my grandfathers comfortable. Before this, I wasn't able to fully appreciate the effect that I could have on somebody with a career in the medical field. I promised myself after enduring this experience that I would use my skills and passion for the medical field to help people in need in any way possible. I was lucky enough to enact on this promise through an organization right on my campus.    \tThe past three years at the University of Cincinnati have given me many wonderful opportunities to volunteer and help those in my community. Cancer had struck me and my family in a very profound way and I was going to do anything I could while pursuing my studies to join the fight against it. Colleges Against Cancer (CAC) has been a very special organization to me over the past three years. I initially joined CAC through the University of Cincinnatis Relay For Life my freshman year as a Team Captain to honor my grandfathers. I have quickly worked myself into a leadership role within the organization that fights so adamantly back against the physical and emotional effects of cancer through significant contributions to research and community fundraising events. What I have given CAC in volunteer time it has given me back ten-fold in the feeling that Im making an impact on this world for the better. It gives me great pride knowing that the work that not only I, but all of those involved with CAC through volunteering and fundraising, are changing the lives of those afflicted with cancer. What has mattered to me most during my college career is not my GPA; the fact that I have been able to join a cause and fight back against disease means much more. I set a goal for myself during my freshman year to help in any way possible; there has been no greater accomplishment to me than helping those afflicted with cancer through my efforts with CAC. It is my goal to continue this giving back through practicing medicine.  \tMy academic accomplishments have presented me with the opportunity to give back, now its my turn to use my experiences with these opportunities to pursue something on my own. My dedication to my studies and to the betterment of others will not waiver as I pursue my career in medicine. Whether I am able to fulfill this dream or my lifes road directs me elsewhere, I know that my passion for assisting those that need it will never falter. This type of work has never felt like a job to me in the typical sense of the word; I know that my calling is with helping those in need. The continuation of this passion into a career in medicine will be the realization of a goal that I know will keep me fulfilled both as a person and a practicing professional. Colleges Against Cancer/Relay For Life Cancer Ed Co-Chair After my experience with Relay For Life as a team captain during my freshman year, I sought to gain more responsibility with Colleges Against Cancer (CAC), the organization that hosted Relay For Life. As the Cancer Education co-chair, my duties on the CAC side of things were to plan on-campus events to educate fellow students on prevention methods of cancer, lead a committee to help with these events, and to attend regional CAC summit meetings representing the University of Cincinnati. As the co-chair on the Relay side, I planned our Fight Back ceremony for UC's Relay For Life event. This was a call-to-action ceremony during Relay that was aimed to liven the mood and encourage participation., Relay For Life - Team Captain As a Relay For Life team captain, my duties included attending meetings hosted by UC's CAC/Relay For Life committee, collecting team funds, holding fundraisers, and attending the night of Relay For Life 18-hour event. I acted as a liaison between the Relay For Life committee and the rest of my team members. As my first involvement with the American Cancer Society through Relay For Life, this was my first leadership experience at the University of Cincinnati., Dean's List As a student at the University of Cincinnati, I have been a member of the Dean's List for my academic achievement in all but one academic term. With the exception of Winter Quarter 2010, I have maintained above a 3.4 GPA in each academic term since starting at UC., Relay For Life - Mission Event Chair As the Mission Event Chair of Relay For Life, I was in charge of four committees that were vital in planning events key to the Relay For Life event. These four committees included Cancer Education, Advocacy, Luminaria, and Survivor and Caregiver Engagement. In my position, I led these four committees in their preparation by acting as their connection between our ACS representatives and their needs. As an executive member of Relay, I attended both committee meetings and executive meetings. At the executive meetings, we would discuss logistical aspects of the Relay event. I would also attend regional Relay For Life summit meetings as a representative from the University of Cincinnati., Biomedical Undergraduate Research At the Wood Hudson Cancer Research Laboratory (WHCRL), we sought to determine a relationship between the receptor status (HER II, ER, PR), cellular protein expression, and disease severity of many breast cancer cell models. During my time at the WHCRL, I was focused primarily on the optimization of our Western Blot procedure; I also had a brief stint with cell culture. This included determining cellular protein concentrations that needed to be loaded into the initial separating gel, primary and secondary antibody concentrations, and film exposure times. It was my goal to devise the correct procedure in order to allow for a greater number of  visualized spots while maintaining clarity., Center For Courageous Kids I have been able to spend both a weekend and entire week volunteering with the Center For Courageous Kids (CCK). CCK provides those children with chronic illnesses a safe camp experience that is free of charge. It was my duty to spend time with a family (my weekend experience) or a group of campers (my week experience). I, along with those other volunteers and workers, sought to provide those campers with the most enjoyable experience possible. I was in charge of meeting the campers in the morning, spending the day with them, and ensuring that they were comfortable and having a good time. My experience was extremely rewarding and gave me patient exposure in a non-traditional sense., Physician Shadowing I was able to shadow not only Dr. Paul Rupp who is a family phsyician, but also Vicki LaFary who is a registered nurse. I have been able to spend entire work days with Dr. Rupp. This experience has not only shown me how doctor-patient interaction goes, but also what occurs when the physician or medical professional isn't in the patient's room. With Dr. Rupp, I was able to follow him into patient's rooms, attend daily meetings, and experience the typical day of a physician., Cincinnatus Scholarship I was awarded the Cincinnatus scholarship prior to my freshman year for my academic performance in high school. In order to maintain the scholarship, one must maintain a 3.2 GPA and volunteer at least 30 hours of their time over the course of the academic year while at the university. I have been rewarded this scholarship every academic year for achieving both qualifications each year., Undergraduate Research Council Fellowship I was selected as a recipient of the Undergraduate Research Council's fellowship for proposed research done in Dr. Litosh's research lab. As one of ten applicants that were selected from those that applied, I was able to continue my research in his lab past the end of my junior year spring semester for a period of two months. It was an extremely beneficial experience as it allowed me to not only continue the research that I had been doing over the semester, but it also allowed me to gain responsibility and plan for a project that I would be heading up and pursuing myself. The fellowship dictated I work 20 hours per week for a period of two months., Synthetic Medicinal Organic Chemistry Research In Dr. Litosh's research lab, I have primarily worked on the synthesis, purification, and identification of key thymidine analogs to be used as anticancer agents. My focus has been concerned with the synthesis of various substituted alcohols used to couple to our thymidine analogs, protection and functionalization via bromination of the thymidine analog, and coupling of the substituted alcohols to the protected and functionalized nucleosides. My project has been focused on varying the substitution of the alcohols coupled to the nucleoside. Trends of the substitution patterns of the modified nucleosides are then determined via cellular testing. IC50 values are determined from the cell tests.,  Peer Tutor,  Supplementary Instruction Leader, Stella and Hoke S. Greene Scholarship The Stella and Hoke S. Greene award is given to a sophomore or junior majoring in chemistry that shows great promise in the field of chemistry. I was recognized by a professor and TA for my work in organic chemistry during my sophomore year. The award is given to only one individual per year out of both the sophomore and junior classes majoring in chemistry., Supplemental Instruction Leader The Supplemental Instruction (SI) Leader program at the University of Cincinnati provides typically difficult courses with undergraduate students that have excelled in those particular classes. SI Leaders hold bi- or tri-weekly sessions amounting to three hours in which we review material, go over practice problems, and field questions that may not have been addressed during lectures. These sessions are planned and held normally by a sole SI leader. The SI program provides numerous opportunities for students to receive assistance with courses such as General and Organic Chemistry, Physics, Biology, etc.  I was the SI Leader for a General Chemistry course taught by Dr. Estel Sprague."

    "text": "Often times the world gives individuals a sense of insignificance, but individuals can and do make a difference.  As I tried to positively influence the life of a young boy named Alex, I learned the satisfaction of giving all to an individual and receiving priceless fulfillment.  Alex and I met through the Big Sibling Little Sibling program at Dartmouth College.  Throughout our relationship, I was Spiderman's arch nemesis Venom, the Joker from Batman, and many more villains.  Alex was always the protagonist because he loved leveling me to the ground with his wrestling moves.  Our reenactments were executed with perfection, but they had a drawback.  The day after, my arms and legs would not move.  As I waddled into class like a bulldog, laughter filled the room.  My classmates knew I had met Alex.  Alex provided laughter for me and my classmates alike.  In the stress of exams and wanting perfection, the laughter was a welcomed relief.  Despite the desire for life to be fun and loving, reality presents bitter challenges.  Although possibly painful, challenges offer opportunities for personal growth as well as a chance to put faith to the test.  Alex once told me his schoolmates made fun of his small eyes.  My throat clenched and I had to hold back the early sting of tears.  It was a situation I was personally too familiar with.  Younger, my classmates pointed their fingers at me teasing, Why do you have a flat nose  Can you see out of your small eyes  I looked at Alex and a huge boulder landed on my vocal chords.  Sharing my experiences with a child proved difficult.  I was afraid Alex would lose respect for me or that he would not take my experience to heart.  Alex made himself vulnerable by telling me his personal concern and so mustering up my courage, I shared my experience with Alex.  Alex hugged me and said he was sorry I had to go through it.  He was just a child and yet I received so much comfort.  Further, Alex was comforted by knowing he was not alone.  My faith in our trust and respect was tested and passed with honors.  My smile clings from ear to ear when I think back to the growth of our friendship.  I do not know when Alex began to trust me, but I remember when I first realized it.  We went sledding and he refused to go down the big hill alone or with anyone else but me.  I was in terrible pain from having just survived a collision with another sleigh-rider, and I exclaimed, Why me!  Alex answered, I trust YOU!  Seconds later I found myself huffing and puffing to the top of the biggest hill with Alex laughing hysterically on one side and an aching cramp on the other.  More than the end result, at times it is the process that proves crucial.  My experiences have taught me that being a doctor involves more than pulling out the correct diagnosis.  Doctors must build a relationship with their patients in order to promote lifetime health.  Yes, doctors need to be educated and provide solutions, but they also need to have the compassion and courage to be present at a patient's bedside to comfort them during times when patients would feel most alone and fearful.  I understand that it is impossible to make lasting relationships with everyone one meets, but the heart to treat anyone with honesty and sincerity must never wane.    Even in academics, success is often determined by the process.  For the first two years of college, I misunderstood how to study.  After consulting previous professors, together, we figured out what I was doing wrong.  Although I was able to improve my grades throughout the last two years of college, applying to medical schools proved the improvement was not good enough.  After retaking the MCATs and trying to enhance my credentials through job-shadowing, I realized what I needed to prove was my academic abilities.  Consequently, I enrolled in the Special Masters Program at the University of Cincinnati.  At first I was scared because having been out of the academic atmosphere for two years and failing to gain acceptance into medical school, my confidence level was low.  After performing well in the medical school courses while in the program; however, I unexpectedly gained more confidence in my abilities as well as reconfirmed that medical school is the route for me.    Few can claim they have not been changed by their life experiences.  If so, it is unfortunate.  Experiences allow individuals to explore who they are, consequently allowing them to learn about themselves and the surrounding world.  Committing to medicine will bring forth agonizing experiences and moments of triumph, but as my relationship with Alex provided growth and fulfillment for both, I know my relationship with the field of medicine will do the same.  Working together with my colleagues, I hope to enrich each others' lives as well as the lives of our patients. Summer Camp Volunteer Your eyes sparkle like the stars was the first thing Minji said to me when we met.  It was my first summer volunteering at a camp for special needs children.  Being unsure of my abilities and if I would be able to successfully connect with Minji, I was extremely nervous.  Her statement, however, melted away my uneasiness.  Unlike most children who grow and mature noticeably over a span of four years, Minji did not change much.  Every year we would encounter the same difficulties sitting in a given area for a solid 10 minutes. I would be disappointed and frustrated as Minji would never participate in any of the camp events and opt to constantly play hide and seek away from the group.  By the third year, however, I realized my selfishness.  I had been looking at the situation only from my perspective.  Could it be possible that Minji did not like group activities, but rather liked one on one attention  Yes!  Only when I stepped into Minji's world and out of my own did our relationship begin to develop., Big Sibling Little Sibling (BSLS) Co-Chair As the co-chair of the BSLS program and also a big sibling, I was held to several responsibilities.  In addition to pairing Dartmouth students with adopted children of Korean decent, I prepared bi-weekly events.  I worked to promote a fun and educational environment where the children could be introduced to Korean culture.  Much research and preparation went into a single event.  Participating in and leading this program was especially fulfilling to me.  As a child I felt alone as I struggled to find myself as a Korean American.  Thus, I knew how powerful and comforting such a program as the BSLS program could be., Research Assistant At first, I spent most of my time in the lab washing and organizing supplies. Then one day, Dr. Haque found herself overwhelmed with tasks. Dr. Haque asked me to help her prepare the appropriate injections for her mice groups. I recorded my every step in the lab notebook and clearly labeled the preparations. I was cleaning the sink area when she called me to her office. I was scared. I thought maybe she did not like the work, but Dr. Haque began to compliment the reliability of my work. She wanted to train me as her direct assistant. I helped Dr. Haque test new pharmaceutical drugs in their effectiveness in treating multiple sclerosis. After successfully learning how to collect and interpret data using FLOW cytommetry, Dr. Haque had me train in breeding transgenic mice for her experiments. As she noticed I could quickly and properly complete tasks assigned to me, the list of my lab responsibilities grew exponentially.  Through the experience, I gained confidence in the work I did as well as the scientific knowledge each experiment required., Mexico Mission Trip Drenched in sweat and cramped inside a small box with three other people, I performed puppet shows for the crowds of children in the poorest neighborhoods of Tijuana, Mexico.  Amidst dire conditions, the children always laughed and wore beaming smiles.  Never did I see a child expressing anguish.  Despite the little Spanish I knew at the time, the children flocked to me and asked me to play.  Just being there was enough.  I did not need to use fancy words or prove myself.  All I had to do was give them my time.  Their laughter shadowed the unrelenting heat and motivated me to give all that I had during my time in their town., SAT Tutor For 5 years, I tutored SAT verbal and math classes for the Intense SAT Summer course.  The employment allowed me to experience the extreme patience required to teach as well as the importance of maintaining a leadership position by gaining respect from the students., Job Shadow - Pediatric Geneticist For the first three weeks, I shadowed Dr. Wallace only for her appointments.  Then on my last week, she asked if I wanted to stay for a meeting the physicians in the genetics department held to discuss their current cases.  After 8 hours of standing silently in a corner, I wanted to go home, but I knew an opportunity like this might not present for a long time.  So, I attended.  One word came to mind as I saw Dr. Wallace passionately discussing one of her new patients--STAMINA.  I sat there in awe.  I knew my eyes were red and I just exuded exhaustion, but Dr. Wallace presented herself with as much energy as she had at the beginning of the day.  Then I realized, in order to take care of others, I must take care of myself so I will be in the best condition possible to take care of others., Korean Language School I helped establish the first Korean language classes at Dartmouth College.  Not being an official course of the college, my peers and I had to do a lot of promoting to actually see fruit to our ambitions.  The classes were first established as a partner program with the BSLS program for the participants, but as interest grew, we also set up courses for the general Dartmouth College student population on a separate day of the week.  Seeing others embrace Korean culture made me ashamed of how much I struggled to embrace my cultural heritage as a child.  In contrast, I felt proud because the experience made me realize how far I had come from that little girl who denied being Korean in the school yard., Job Shadow - General Practitioner Job-shadowing produced an unexpected result.  Although I spent most of the time silently observing the interactions between Dr. Yung and her patients, building a relationship with Dr. Yung made me realize the narrow scope with which I was viewing the career as a physician.  All I kept in my mind was becoming a physician and somehow everything else in my life would fall magically into place.  Then, as I watched Dr. Yung juggle being a Mother, wife, and a Physician--all of which I see myself fulfilling in the future--I realized I will have to work hard to maintain a healthy balance in my life.  I was forced to ask myself, Will I be able to maintain that crucial balance and do it all to a standard I would be satisfied with, Female Lead for Korean Culture Night (KCN) Play KCN occurs annually during the Spring term at Dartmouth College.  The Korean Student Association is responsible for producing a play that explores current issues affecting the Korean community.  As the female lead of the Korean Culture Night play for two consecutive years, I was able to pursue one of my other thrills in life--acting!  Further, working with a larger group of people than I was used to, I was able exercise the skills of cooperation and compromise.  I enjoyed every minute of the grueling practices and the rush of discovering new aspects of myself as I tried to successfully portray my character as well as spread knowledge of current issues within the Korean community.,  Retail, Circulation Desk Clerk Simply speaking, I aided people in their quest to find the necessary resources.  Unexpectedly, working at the circulation desk at the library reinforced the importance of having passion for my work.  Although I was pleased when I helped students find the appropriate material, it did not compare to the satisfaction I felt at my previous job in the lab.  In the lab, I was able to feel the amazement as I saw what I learned in my biology classes translate to real life through mice models.  This excitement did not parallel as I worked at the circulation desk.  I did not feel passion for my work and I was left unmotivated., Clinic Volunteer Through my church I was able to volunteer at a clinic in Mexico.  I was ecstatic that I was assigned to the emergency room. I naively pictured the emergency room being a place where I could peacefully witness exciting events.  I was right about being able to witness exciting events, but not peacefully.  One minute I would be reading to children in the waiting area and the next I would be helping a nurse restrain an uncooperative patient.  I had my hands full just being a volunteer.  How did the doctors and nurses manage  In the midst of all the chaos, the head doctor always kept his composure.  Treating each patient diligently and thoroughly, he never seemed caught off guard.  I knew wisdom from years of experience and confidence in his skill all contributed to his composure.  The experience made me realize I wanted to be able to just that, but also made me wonder if I was suited for it., Hospital Volunteer Throughout high school, I spent my Friday evenings volunteering as a candy striper at Evergreen Hospital.  I would mainly assist patients to and from their hospital rooms, but at times, I would check up on long term patients.  As I grew more familiar with those patients, and they with me, they began to ask me to paint their nails or just sit with them while they watched TV.  I realized how much they wanted companionship and being able to fulfill that simple need of theirs had such rewarding consequences for me.  As I continued to volunteer and witnessed more patient-physician interactions, I began to want to be able to help the patients as a physician in the future., National Youth Leadership Forum (NYLF) on Medicine While volunteering at a hospital during high school, I wanted an opportunity to explore deeper into the field of medicine and gain a broader knowledge of what a medical profession entailed.  Thus, when I received notice that I had been accepted to the NYLF on Medicine, I sent in my deposit to hold my spot automatically.  Through the program, I was able to shadow doctors of various fields as well as get a glimpse into life as a medical student through question and answer sessions medical students held.  Each day of the program fueled my curiosity for medicine.  NYLF on Medicine was one of my initial experiences that added fuel to my ambitions of becoming a physician."

    "text": "Two things made me fall in love with science. The first was learning how plants turn light into food, and the second was realizing that when we lose weight we breathe it out as CO2. What fascinates me now though is that despite these fundamental commonalities, people can be so incredibly unique. Where we grow up, whom we know, what we believe...they all play a role in determining whom we become. Having grown up as a dual national, I am acutely aware of this. However classes, internships, volunteering and personal experiences helped me appreciate how this applies to health and healthcare. Developing an understanding of this has allowed me to become a well-rounded person, and a strong medical education will equip me to become an excellent doctor.    My journey to a medical education has not been direct. Given that I have an inquisitive mind, I initially considered research. Being a fan of the outdoors, I applied for and was awarded a student research grant to design and conduct an environmental research project. In addition, as a research intern in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and then as a research associate in Emergency Medicine, I learned to appreciate the painstaking details involved in clinical research. With these internships I observed the inner workings of the medical setting: the triumphs alongside the hard decisions, the finances, and the agony of defeat. Though I appreciate the intellectual stimulation of formal research I prefer the satisfaction of directly serving others.  My most satisfying extracurricular experiences embrace the contentment received from making a difference in others' lives. As a registered tutor throughout college I truly enjoyed helping students develop the skills necessary to approach a subject, and watching them go from complete frustration to actually enjoying it. Later, caring for animals at the local animal shelter taught me about being compassionate while still making decisions and drawing hard lines.  These are things that spurred my interest in science and in serving others, but why medicine At fifteen my world was rocked when I was diagnosed with FSH Muscular Dystrophy. It was a tough time for many reasons, in part because I was told to quit soccer, a sport that was my life, my connection to friends, and my stress release. It would not only change me, but the life I imagined for myself. With support from family and friends, and some serious soul-searching, I came to see it as a difference, rather than a disability. I am able to play pick-up soccer, rock climb with my roommate, and continue backpacking with friends. This experience prompted me to see how I could make a difference to others in my situation. As I began to more seriously pursue a medical career, I came to see how this might be an advantage. Scans, pills, physical therapy, blood work, specialists, clinical trials...medical school can teach us a great deal about health care, but understanding what patients see is different.   Having this background why did I not apply to medical school immediately after completing my undergraduate degree I knew what it involved, and I knew it was what I wanted to do, but I also knew that I wanted to do it well. Being raised in a bi-lingual home I am aware that what is said is not always what is understood. Personal experience with doctors and hospitals gave me a head start, but I need to broaden my perspective. I feel there is a gap between patients who work forty-hour weeks while caring for a family, and residents who have been students their entire life. Too often there is frustration with patients who do not follow prescribed care, and too often patients are confused about what is happening to and around them. I chose to work for a couple years after college knowing that to understand my patients I would need to appreciate their day-to-day lives. Telling someone to 'be more active' seems like a simple enough instruction, but I quickly learned that after eight hours of work, collapsing on to a sofa is really enticing. In a continuing effort to broaden my perspective and further understand the interactions between patients, doctors, and health care systems, next summer I will have completed one-year Masters of Science in Medical Anthropology at the University of Oxford.   Health and the human body have always intrigued me, but I know one cannot base a medical career on that alone. My interest in medicine stems from a respect for science and a desire to serve others that has been nurtured by personal experiences and by conscious effort educate myself and explore the field. I have reached a point where I am ready to take on the honor of becoming a Doctor of Medicine. Academic Awards and Honors - Honors at Entrance Scholarship: Awarded to freshmen entering with GPA over 3.7 and SAT score over 1200  - Presidential Scholarship: Freshmen with GPA over 3.8 and SAT score over 1350 compete via interviews for only two scholarships - Dean's List: Earned a GPA over 3.5 all eight semesters  - CRC Freshman Chemistry Award: Awarded to the two freshmen earning the highest General Chemistry scores - Summer Research Award: detailed in another section - Graduated Magna Cum Laude, Employment During College As a student with a demanding schedule that made it difficult to work and make ends meet, I was fortunate to find several jobs that allowed me to work around my academic priorities.   - Math and Science Tutor: detailed in another section  - Campus Event Staff (11/04-11/07): During sporting events on campus my responsibilities varied and included setting up, supervising spectators, providing security, and generally ensuring a pleasant, organized environment.  - Study Abroad Outreach Aid (1/06-11/07): Having spent an enriching semester abroad in Europe, I eagerly accepted a position advertising and recruiting for my college's study abroad program.  - Regal Theater Floor Staff (summer and winter holidays 2005-08, 35hrs/wk): My responsibilities were to sell tickets and merchandise while providing outstanding customer service. I was Employ of the Month July 2005.  - House sitting (2000-present): I care for homes, yards, and pets when their owners are out of town. In addition, I monitor property for storm damage and deal with problems that arise, including pet emergencies.   These jobs taught me to manage my time, work efficiently and take pride in my work. I also learned about small business, the importance of a good reputation in building a client base, and how to deal with acrimonious people., Math and Science Tutor At the Saint Mary's College Tutorial and Academic Skills Center I was trained to identify a student's needs and learning style, as well as various techniques for presenting material. I worked with students who learned very differently, so I was challenged to see things from their view. I altered my explanation of a concept to fit an individual's background and level of knowledge, while making sure they understood before we progressed from one idea to another. I was a paid tutored for Calculus my freshman year and Human Anatomy and Physiology my senior year, and throughout all four years I volunteer tutored and held review sessions in the dorms for students and classmates who needed help with various subjects.   Overall, this experience allowed me to contribute to the campus community, taught me to manage my time well, and taught me how to guide someone through the learning process to a point of true understanding., Clinical Research -Internship (5/07): Contemplating a career in research, I sought out an internship in the UC Davis Dept. of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. The investigators were designing a drug trial but required a movement evaluation study to establish baseline values against which data could be compared. I participated in daily progress meetings and was responsible for designing standardized case report forms. After completing study related duties I shadowed in the clinic where physicians saw patients with various musculoskeletal disorders. Some patients were undergoing initial diagnosis, some pursuing physical or occupational therapy, others experimenting with alternative treatments, and still others resigning to or embracing their condition.   -Participant in clinical trial (8/04): I had the opportunity to be a subject in a clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of creatine in preventing muscle degradation, and I am currently participating in a longitudinal NIH sponsored study tracking FSHD patients.     -Emergency Medicine Research Associate Program: Detailed in another section.  In the end, though clinical research is more interesting to me than lab or fieldwork, I believe my true calling encompass a profession offering the person-to-person interactions found in primary care medicine., Shadowing Orthopedic Physician Assistant Knowing it prudent to learn about allied health care professions, I shadowed a physician assistant who worked with an orthopedic surgeon.  This experience allowed me to see situations related to surgery and interactions that are unique to PA-physician and PA-patient relationships.   Sitting in on pre- and post-surgery appointments allowed me to see what questions and concerns patients have when faced with joint replacement surgery. Also, as most of the patients were having knees replaced because of ageing joints, I was able to see interactions between older patients the health care staff. The PA was often called 'doctor' and patients gave him the same respect and authority as they did the surgeon, but he was cautious to not overstep his boundaries.   In the end, being a physician assistant does not allow for the freedom or control I hope to have when dealing with patients. However I am glad I had the opportunity to learn about the position as well as observe surgery-related issues.,  Member Service Rep I (Teller), Animal Shelter Volunteer Much of Yolo County is rural and the tough economy has been taking a toll. After college graduation I did not have money to donate, and though my schedule with a job and internship was variable, I wanted to give back to this community that supported me during my youth. Fortunately I discovered Yolo County Animal Services, which is run by the Sheriffs Department, and where volunteers could visit freely, without committing to dates and times in advance.  Animal Services community volunteers provide a variety of tasks depending on their skill level and so I have had the opportunity to perform a range of functions. I began with cleaning kennels and exercising animals, but having shown a true commitment I am now helping with more consequential duties. These include vaccinating newly acquired animals, running tests for diseases and medicating animals that have been with us for a while.  Also I get to return lost animals to owners and introduce potential pets to new owners. I am fortunate to assist with fund raising activities as well.   This experience has allowed me to provide a service to the community and has taught me to be compassionate while maintaining the objectivity necessary to be efficient and economical., Credit Union Teller (Member Service Representative) My duties as a teller were to provide excellent member service while conducting transactions and ensuring members had accounts best suited to their needs, all while being sure to have my funds balanced at the end of each day. This job emphasized the importance of accuracy, taught me how to maintaining personal and professional boundaries, and demonstrated how complicated it can be to define the boundaries of an individual's privacy.    Through this experience I fine-tuned my abilities to interact with people from diverse cultural and economic backgrounds, many who were often inclined to share great detail about their personal lives. I quickly learned to be interested in members' stories without becoming too involved, unless danger or fraud warranted it. This connection to members allowed me to see how finances are intricately tied to all aspects of their lives, including their health. Not only in terms of what they could afford, but in stress caused by worrying and juggling obligations., Emergency Medical Research Associate Program The EMRAP is a competitive program through the Emergency Department of the University of California Davis Medical Center. As part of the program I underwent an extensive orientation program to learn about the complex emergency department environment and provide background information on the research studies. Training covered patient confidentiality, professionalism, infection control, research ethics and consent, and the overall function of the emergency department. Having been trained I am now responsible for one or two four-hour shifts per week during which I function as an active member of the emergency medicine research team. I introduce studies to patients, evaluate records for inclusion/exclusion criteria, collect and record data, and generally help facilitate the research process.  This experience gives me a great deal of direct patient contact and the opportunity to observe a number of medical events, including major resuscitations and, unfortunately, death. Between research patients I have the opportunity to shadow emergency medicine physicians and observe several procedures and interactions. This program also affords me the opportunity to speak with medical school students and residents and learn about what to expect from medical school., Environmental Field Research The Saint Mary's College School of Science holds a school-wide competition for three research awards. Awards are granted based on a written research proposal and include funding for ten weeks of research conduced under the supervision of a faculty member. I submitted a proposal and was granted an award to conduct an environmental research project titled Aquatic Invasive Species Survey: The Spiny Water Flea in Gratiot Lake, Michigan. I chose this topic after speaking with locals at the Gratiot Lake Conservancy about their concern with a potential infestation of the Spiny Water Flea, an invasive species that had recently appeared in the area.   That summer, after a month of background preparation, I traveled to Gratiot Lake and spent four weeks in a rustic cabin traipsing around mosquito-infested inlets gathering data and analyzing water samples. The data was presented in both a written report and orally to professors and peers in the science department.   From this experience I learned the steps involved in research, about accounting for unpredictable weather, and about the relationship between the environment, economy and people. I also confirmed that, though I am interested in the outdoors and conservation, environmental research is not for me., Shadowing Cardiology in Italy While studying abroad I took advantage of an opportunity to see how hospitals in Italy were different than those in the United States. Through Treviso's Ospedale Regionale Ca' Foncello I scheduled three, eight-hour visits to observe at the hospital. The Italian doctors and nurses were equally interested in my American perspective, so I was able to shadow different people during my visits. Before entering a patient's room a physician briefed me on the patient's history and what he expected from the encounter. I was then allowed to sit in on each session and observe how the doctor and nurse interacted with the patients: listening to what they said, explaining what the next steps were, and fielding any questions the patient had. There were many interesting cases, but more attractive to me was observing each practitioner's role in the healthcare process. I was able to see how healthcare providers interacted with one another and with patients in different ways.  I went into this experience keen on noting cultural differences in health care, of which there were several. However I also learned about the variety of interactions between doctors, nurses and patients. By watching the staff handle situations I had not anticipated I saw how they adapted to changing situations."

    "text": "The death of my best friend laid the foundation for my future. Caring, docile and patient, he possessed all the traits needed to tolerate me as an 11 year old. I indulged in games with him, bored him with stories, and hugged him when I needed comforting. My fondest memory of him was when he gently proffered me a gift. I squeamishly stared down at the freshly killed mouse. Nevertheless, I understood what his gesture signified: I was his owner and he was my cat. When we moved across the continent, my parents could not bring him along. My mom settled him in a shelter where he was given a week to be either adopted or euthanized. Even as a child I grasped the hopelessness of the situation. He was an adult cat, no longer cute and frisky. The multitude of homeless cats and his short parole span further assured his death sentence. My cat was powerless in a world where humans dominated. Tears welled up as I faced this situation that neither he nor I had control over.  The loss of my cat established my sense of duty to help people who also felt powerless in certain situations. I have since mentored and tutored disadvantaged children, supported hospitalized patients, and provided health care to the underserved. I feel immense gratification in providing my services to them, but I especially savor meeting the challenges that those that are ill present. As a volunteer for the Cancer Support Group, I engage in the healing process of many vulnerable individuals with cancer. I lend an ear to hear about their week and communicate calmly to soothe their fears. Words and compassion are valuable, but I am not satisfied with my limited involvement; I am also eager to comprehend their diseases and directly restore their health.  My medical anthropology education has also shaped my view on health and disease. My own experiences have further enlightened me on the disparate perceptions of medicine and illness among cultures. For instance, my cultural background has exposed me to various traditional Chinese medicines that are unfamiliar to most Americans. Furthermore, my experience with providing health care in the Dominican Republic underscored the need to contextualize people's health. During my stay, I learned that the inadequate purification system for public drinking water often led to its contamination by roundworms. Boiling or purifying the water with commercially available tools could prevent roundworm infection in people. However, the underprivileged patients I saw were unaware of or unable to afford these tools and the medical care needed. Thus, they accepted the accompanying symptoms as ordinary events in their lives. In addition to providing them with medication, I had to work against the language barrier and counsel them on the necessities of boiling drinking water and seeking medical care for the symptoms. I was impressed upon by the significance of learning each person's perspective and background in order to provide patient-centered care to him or her.  In the U.S., many barriers also exist to prevent people from accessing adequate health care. The uninsured and impoverished struggle to obtain health care, and even those with insurance often delay their health care needs until they reached critical moments. My friend's mom, who was insured through her husband, had experienced intense pain for a month before she finally sought medical care. A few days later she passed away from cancer. Her prognosis may have been better if she had seen a doctor earlier. Yet, barriers such as medical costs had prevented her from doing so. My experiences in free medical clinics also led me to realize that those who cannot access medical care often need it the most. I am motivated to become a physician in order to provide low-cost and easier access to health care where it is needed.  My interest in public health prompted me to pursue an MPH degree in epidemiology. This education equipped me with the skills needed to study, qualify and quantify risk factors and optimal treatments for diseases, and to approach health care at a population level. My education and experiences have produced for me an incomplete jigsaw puzzle; I am only qualified to provide preventive care, and when that fails, I am powerless to provide anything more than supportive care to the ill. Thus, I am ready to embark on a journey in medicine to find the critical pieces and solve the puzzle. Medical training would empower me to directly diagnose and treat patients, restore their health, and provide comprehensive care by seeing the complete picture. My goal is to improve upon the health care that I witnessed in the Dominican Republic and to continue helping people as powerless as my cat in certain situations. To this day, I do not know what became of my best friend. Yet, he will continue to influence me by strengthening my resolve to help those in need. Study Group Leader; Volunteer Tutor I led a weekly, 2-hour study group for 12-14 college students taking the General Physics 1 course. For 2 hours per week prior to the meetings, I reviewed course materials and completed course assignments in order to better assist my members. I also created worksheets summarizing course concepts, compiled practice problems for my members, and prepared creative and educative games. During each session, I facilitated activities and engaged students in reviewing course materials, solving practice problems, and applying course concepts as a group. I tailored my responses to refrain from providing direct answers and challenged others to think for themselves and as a group. I also led extra, 2-hour review sessions prior to exams and conducted individual 1-3 hour tutoring sessions for students who requested them. By really listening to my students, I was able to adapt my teaching style to suit their needs and refine my leadership skills. Due to my dedication and accomplishments, I was selected by the Assistant Director to serve on the newly formed Advisory Committee, comprised of 18 out of 250 leaders. The committee met once per week for an hour to work towards developing the program. I helped prepare surveys to study group leaders and provided suggestions for improving the program and the leader workshops., Volunteer I participated in a week-long service-learning trip with 13 other college students through Alternative Spring Break. Starting in November, we met weekly for an hour and prepared ourselves for the trip by increasing our awareness of the issues surrounding disadvantaged students. I also spent 10 hours fundraising for the trip. Our group then traveled to volunteer at Epworth, an agency that provided services for youths with severe physical and behavioral disorders. Throughout the day, I mainly interacted with high school students with behavioral disorders. I provided a positive model of behavior and developed rapport while tutoring the students in English, science, history and math. I also played basketball and charades with them and engaged in other classroom and recess activities. DT, a boy I met, especially stood out during the trip. His refreshingly nice personality and presence at Epworth seemed contradictory, but enlightened me on how his environment and experiences have shaped his identity. Our 2-hour nightly group reflections over the day's events further deepened my understanding of the inequities in life, appreciation of my own opportunities, and desire to help others in need., Medical Volunteer; Shadowed Physicians I spent 25 hours shadowing urgent care physicians. I mainly shadowed Dr. Khan and observed health care from her perspective. I also discussed patient diagnosis and treatment options with her and performed some physical examinations on patients. Although she explained each diagnosis to me, I was constantly reminded of how much more I needed to learn. I realized the challenges she faced as a physician in order to satisfy each patient's needs. Having recently completed her residency, she also shared her residency stories with me, including the horrors of getting caught eating during medical rounds. I further developed rapport with the medical assistants at the clinic, who shared their perspectives of health care with me as well., Medical Volunteer; Shadowed Physicians I split my time volunteering at the Physicians Free Clinic and the Asian Health Initiative Free Clinic from February to April and will start again in July of this year. I assisted in administrative duties and took medical histories of patients, performed physical examinations on them, and helped to make them feel comfortable. I spent 15 hours shadowing physicians and witnessed primary health care from their perspectives. I was constantly made aware of the amount of learning still ahead for me. I also gained the foundational knowledge for organizing and funding the delivery of free health care. The large number of patients accessing these clinics underscored the need for this care and prompted me to seek medical training to help them., Hospital Volunteer I volunteered at the Mott Children's Hospital until June 2008. I interacted with young patients in the Pediatric Cardiology Department (inpatient) and Clinic (outpatient). I played with the patients, witnessed health care from their parents' and their own perspectives, and assisted nurses and therapists with various activities, such as setting-up arts and crafts games for the patients. Starting in September 2008, I volunteered at the Women's Hospital Birth Center. I worked with a Unit Host, who supported nursing and administrative staff members. I helped take baby pictures, prepared supplies for nurses, stocked nourishment rooms for patients, provided support to new and pregnant mothers, and helped discharged mothers pack and leave the hospital. I also observed the medical care of newborns from their mothers' perspectives. In both experiences, I acquired knowledge on the organization of the hospital healthcare system and administration and on the roles the various hospital employees played., Volunteer Tutor I volunteered at this youth-driven teen center with the intent of working with disadvantaged students and observing the programs offered by the center. I tutored disadvantaged high school students in math and science. I also witnessed how programs supported by the center led to their growth and development. I was inspired to be empowered to improve the health and lives of other disadvantaged people so they can help their communities thrive as well., Site Leader; Volunteer I was a co-site leader for a week-long Alternative Spring Break service-learning trip for 14 college students. Prior to this trip, I attended weekly 1-hour workshops to build teamwork and leadership skills. My co-site leader and I further prepared and held weekly 1-hour meetings with our group. We fostered group bonding and engaged members in increasing their awareness of issues surrounding people with disabilities such as cerebral palsy. We also organized 20 hours of fundraising activities for our trip. Our group then traveled to volunteer at Githens Center, an agency providing programs and services to children and adults with disabilities. Throughout the day, we played and interacted with the adults, completed clerical duties, and tutored, played with, and fed the children. Each night, my co-site leader and I prepared and facilitated 1-hour discussions over our experiences as a group. I challenged my group to consider how people dependent on the support of others could thrive in our society. I also asked them to reflect on how these individuals could acquire sufficient health care when health care rationing was prevalent. I was motivated to help improve the lives of those with disabilities., Hospital Volunteer I was involved in three 6-week programs where I was exposed to individuals with cancer or grieving over their loved ones' serious illness or death. I supported the adult participants by listening to their stories, comforting them, and interacting with them in various other ways. In the children support groups, I assisted the art therapists in preparing and setting-up activities geared towards teaching children about cancer or healthy grieving processes. I also interacted with the children and facilitated their activities, engaged their attention, encouraged their active participation, and provided them with support and advice. I have observed and learned communication skills from the therapists and counselors and developed my own skills as well. I have further acquired knowledge about the different aspects needed for quality patient health care from the patients' perspectives, which I use to provide patient-centered care., Research Assistant I was involved in two research projects for 2-6 hours per week. I wrote an expedited IRB proposal regarding cytokine gene polymorphisms and human leukocyte antigen cell-surface antigens and their associations with clinical outcomes in solid organ transplants. I am waiting to hear back from the committee in order to begin research. I am also working on increasing public awareness of the risk of cancer among HIV patients, the AIDS Cancer Clinic in Columbus, and the opportunities for patients with HIV and cancer to participate in clinical research. So far, I have researched cancer statistics and helped prepare brochures for patients and providers. I will be preparing an informational toolkit for patients with HIV and cancer and helping to create a website for patients and providers., Volunteer Mentor I was involved with InnoWorks, a college student-run program that provided week-long educational activities introducing science and math concepts to disadvantaged middle school students. These activities included engineering rockets and robots and observing the disappearance act of glass objects in oil. As a mentor, I engaged and supported my mentee in the activities, challenged him with questions, and imparted my knowledge and skills to enrich his experience. By listening to and critically observing my mentee, I adapted my mentoring skills to suit his needs. I also participated in 1-hour staff meetings at the end of each day to discuss the day's events and provided suggestions for improving the program and resolving other mentors' issues. Having previously worked with disadvantaged children, I observed how the opportunities and family support my mentee was blessed with positively influenced his identity. For instance, supported by an entrepreneurship program, he had begun his own business in selling his self-formulated barbeque sauce. I was inspired to work towards improving the health and lives of other underprivileged people so they can succeed in life as well., Research Assistant; Publication I worked full-time in the summer and 6-12 hours a week while in school on research involving lipid A, a component of the vital glycoprotein, lipopolysaccharide, which comprises the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. I investigated the lipid A biosynthesis pathway with the intent of designing therapeutic agents that inhibit the pathway in antibacterial-resistant microbes. Through observing others, following protocols, and hands-on experience, I acquired many cellular, molecular and biochemical research skills such as protein extraction and purification techniques. My hard work earned me a co-authorship:  Mamat U, Meredith TC, Aggarwal P, Kühl A, Kirchhoff P, Lindner B, Hanuszkiewicz A, Sun J, Holst O, Woodard RW. Single amino acid substitutions in either YhjD or MsbA confer viability to 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid-depleted Escherichia coli. Molecular Microbiology. 2008 Feb; 67(3):633-48.  I was also entrusted to teach and mentor a peer co-worker. I further independently researched the LpxA protein involved in lipid A biosynthesis. I participated in lab meetings, presented my research findings, critiqued a co-worker's thesis, and assisted other co-workers in their research endeavors. I integrated concepts from my classes and improved my analytical and critical thinking skills., Site Leader; Volunteer My co-site leader and I led a group of 5 college students on a week-long service-learning trip over the summer. Prior to the trip, I built my teamwork and leadership skills through weekly 1-hour workshops. My co-site leader and I also prepared and held weekly 1-hour group meetings where we encouraged members to build rapport and become more aware of the issues surrounding disadvantaged students. We also organized 20 hours of fundraising activities for our trip. At the start of summer, our group traveled to volunteer with Teach for America (TFA) teachers. I worked with an 8th grade teacher and assisted her in classroom duties, observed teacher-class interactions, acquired and developed my own communication skills, tutored students individually and in small groups in math and biology, and acted as a role model for positive student behavior. I also faced the challenge of leading the class for a day and teaching math and biology to the students when the teacher was absent. While facilitating 1-hour discussions each night with my co-site leader, I questioned my group on whether the short-term teaching commitments of TFA teachers sufficiently resolved the underserved population's educational needs. This impelled me to seek the training required to provide continuity care for those in need., Treasurer; Community and Hospital Volunteer My interest in providing medical and preventive care led me to participate in this college student-run organization. I met with the group weekly or biweekly for an hour to discuss and plan activities. I also helped create a healthy cookbook for underprivileged populations. Furthermore, I volunteered for 5 hours at an elementary school and at Mott Children's Hospital and engaged the children in healthy and fun activities geared towards providing them with health awareness and prevention education. These activities included playing healthy food bingo, creating faces with fruits, and competing in team obstacle course events. As an executive board officer, I helped organize and lead mass meetings to recruit members and improved public relations through communicating with other organizations., Medical Volunteer; Shadowed Foreign Physicians With a group of 35 college students, I embarked on a 2-week trip to the Dominican Republic to provide health care in impoverished communities. We travelled and spent 9 hours a day in 6 different clinics. I took patient histories, performed patient physical exams, and wrote and filled prescriptions under the direction of foreign physicians. My group of 2 other students and I developed enough skills to be entrusted, with physician supervision, to diagnose adults and children with common diseases and provide them with medication and advice. Although 1 of the students spoke fluent Spanish and acted as the group translator, I was often required to depend on my hand gestures and body language when questioning and counseling patients. I spent 14 hours shadowing foreign physicians and witnessed health care from their perspectives. I also observed the healthcare system in the Dominican Republic. I noticed that underserved patients lacked sufficient access to medical care and usually depended on local, unskilled pharmacists to diagnose their condition and provide them with the appropriate treatment. Our short-term clinics were ineffective in providing them with adequate health care, which motivated me to seek the training needed to provide comprehensive, continuity care to those in need."

    "text": "An elephant choked the air from my lungs with its massive weight, squeezing me until my shocked paralysis broke into an eruption of panic. It was my first asthma attack. I was seven years old and I thought I was dying. I vividly recall controlling my own tight, rasping lungs by focusing on my parents. This was the first of many instances in which stress tested and strengthened my mental acuity. I realize now, that at this young age, I already knew how to maintain my composure in intense situations by focusing on others. This experience changed my life.   Fear and confusion disspated readily in the E.R. The doctor and nurses were a skilled, confident, and fluid team and their voices almost smiled as they moved from one room to the next. As the breathing treatment opened my airways, I felt energized by the vitality and purpose of what I saw. The compassionate doctor kept us informed, easing our concerns. This simple, tremendous moment was my earliest inspiration, instilling in me what has become a passion for both science and service.   Youthful admiration matured into genuine ambition. I volunteered at both Children's Hospital and at Sunrise, a local retirement home to learn about medicine and health. I competed and held leadership roles in my school's tennis, swimming, and lacrosse teams, learning discipline and perserverence. I managed eight successful blood drives, raising thousands of dollars for cancer and heart research and started the first recycling program at Bexley schools. I took every AP science class available (eventually winning an award for the most science credits taken in the history of my school). I also shadowed several physicians throughout middle and high school. I found the most joy in knowing something about the patients I encountered, in trading stories and in being connected. These endeavors enriched my high school experience, confirming my desire and ability to pursue the profession that so inspired me as a seven year old.  I also became aware that practicing medicine was not easy. I had shadowed pediatricians, opthomologists, a surgeon, and an OB-GYN. Each had many distractions from patient treatment that became a full time job in and of themselves. Knowing this, I am still undeterred. I drew inspiration from finding that each physician had an overriding, although different, motivation to do what he or she did. Dr. Roger Friedman, a Columbus allergist, provided powerful insight. His patients come first. He always ensures that each patient understands his or her own condition, making them partners in treatment. I also saw that he does far more than just operate a practice. He has a full life outside of the office as well, fully engaged with family, recreation, and community leadership.  In college, my burgeoning commitment to the fight against rape and sexual assault found an unexpected and powerful connection with my medical concentration. During Take Back the Night and the Vagina Monologues, two events I helped organize through the Association for Women Students (AWS), I empathized with the pain of hundreds of women and men as they recounted stories of their past. As a volunteer in the E.R. at McCullough Hyde Hospital, I witnessed the experience of recent survivors of sexual abuse, providing comfort and compassion wherever possible. Interestingly, my exploration of psychological and physical trauma through AWS gave me a unique, tender connection to the patients I encountered at the hospital.  My interests in environmental conservation, research, and sociology confirmed medicine as my career ambition. I became captivated by nature at an early age and have since found cleanups, education, and political action incredibly gratifying. My devotion to healing the Earth mirrors my desire to heal humanity one person at a time as a doctor. Conducting research in Dr. Callahan's endocrinology lab taught me the challenge of patience and the joy of discovery. I am learning the technical expertise to benefit humanity through medical research and the hunger for knowledge to pursue that calling. I was awarded the Outstanding Medical Sociology Minor this year in part because I so strongly identify with the discipline's perspectives on health. Medical sociology emphasizes knowing people as a whole, beyond their chief complaint. Though I pursue diverse interests at Miami, involvement with each has continually brought me back to medicine as a primary goal.   Harvey Cushing, the renowned neurosurgeon, said, a physician is obligated to consider more than a diseased organ, more even than a whole man -- he must view the man in his world. I agree wholeheartedly. This is one of my primary motivators in pursuing medicine. Beginning as a seven year old in need, then gaining years of hands on experience with doctors and patients, I know I have the skills, temperament, and most importantly, the passion to follow my dream. Viewing my whole world, seeing me as a student, volunteer, social activist, and researcher is the only way to understand my drive to become a physician. Someday I want to be the one who calms and treats another seven year old in the middle of the night. Emergency Department Volunteer As a student volunteer, I primarily aid in the flow and treatment of patients. My shift is on Thursday evenings from 10 pm to 1 am. My formal duties include cleaning rooms, making beds, restocking rooms, tending to the patients' comfort, transporting patients and samples for testing, filling out paperwork, and aiding the nurses in whatever way I can. I have developed good working relationships with the E.R. physicians. I have learned much about Emergency medicine on the job by accompanying the physicians on their patient visits and experiencing both the pace and emotions of a unique medical environment. I most enjoyed speaking with patients during the quiet moments and watching the nurses use their expertise in quickly comforting and caring for patients. My study of Medical Sociology enhanced my experience as a volunteer by allowing analytical discussion with staff and observation of healthcare dynamics and interaction each time I was there., Tappan Hall President As the elected head of the Tappan Hall Council, the governing body of my first residence Hall, I coordinated many activities and service projects for its 287 student residents. Our activities encouraged maximum participation and were consistently well-attended. We sponsored weekly service trips for the residence hall, including volunteering in an animal shelter and a retirement home, cleaning up campus and community areas, maintenance work and yardwork for area organizations, and an ongoing mentoring and tutoring program with the local middle school. We also ensured interaction with the other dormitories in our part of campus through large social events to encourage students to participate in campus life on the weekends and develop positive social relationships with their peers. Happily, I successfully delivered on all campaign promises., President, Secretary of AWS As the incoming President, I am planning two Take Back the Night Marches to raise awareness of rape and sexual assault on campus. Last year, I helped make Take Back the Night the most-attended march in AWS history by recruiting more than 200 people. I will also head production of the Vagina Monologues, an international event held annually in February to bring attention to both the joys and traumas women experience through written monologues. I also hope to hold several fundraisers throughout the year at the Student Center and partner with a campus theatre organization called the Walking Theatre Project to create a presentation on preventing sexual violence. Throughout the year, we will raise money to support the Butler County Rape Crisis Center, which recently lost $38,000 in funding from the United Way. During the past two years I have been the Secretary, communicating with and organizing all its members, creating and carrying out several successful fundraisers. I also communicated with and involved University administration in our activities. For the past three years, I fundraised for and acted in the Vagina Monologues production, as well as spread awareness of sexual assault and violence toward women through social action., Independent Research At Bexley High School, I became very interested in the Caribbean coral reef environment through my school's annual trip to Andros Island, Bahamas. For my senior project, I collected field population data on the Diadema antillarum, the long-spined black sea urchin. In doing so, I found several factors and patterns contributing to species recovery after the outbreak of disease in the late 1980s that decimated the species (and damaged the reef community) in the Caribbean., Restaurant Work - Waittress, Foorunner, and Hostess During the summer of 2008, I worked at three restaurants simultaneously. First, I worked as a waittress at Black Creek Bistro, a newly-established, locally owned restaurant. I interacted with and served guests and helped create an effective menu by collecting data on the job. I also served as a publicist for the restaurant's all-organic, Ohio-supplied ingredients at local events. Second, I worked as a hostess at Brio coordinating and communicating with wait staff and managers, seating guests, using a multi-line phone, and regularly appeasing impatience. Finally, I worked as a foodrunner at Lindey's, serving and catering to all restaurant guests and training new employees very soon after I was hired. I have since worked at Lindey's during subsequent summers (2009 and 2010). This summer, I was promoted to server status, organizing, serving, and cocktailing large-party banquets., Team Captain, Luminaria Chair for Relay for Life Each year, I serve as a team captain to encourage my peers to raise funds and participate in the Relay. I raise $200 - $1300 annually for the American Cancer Society by geting sponsors and conducting fundraisers with my team. I also organize the Luminaria, which are memorials for cancer victims, for most relays. These efforts support cancer research, inform and unite the community, celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, and memorialize those who lost their lives to cancer. I have maintained a strong connection with Relay for Life throughout high school and college because I enjoy getting to know those who the Relay most benefits. This annual event is a unique opportunity for cancer victims and their families to connect with a large and supportive network within their communities, promote strength and optimism within the community, and encourage participation in the process of research and discovery in medicine. The contact person is relevant for the 2010 Relay, but I have worked with many different Relay Chairs and leaders each year., Board Member and Judge of Student Inventions From March of 2005 until November of 2007, I served as a member of a board of student judges for the National Museum of Education. Each year, the other members of the board and I spent one weekend in the fall judging the projects. The applicants ranged in age from six to eighteen. However, the projects ranged from very simple, marketable inventions to incredibly technical and involved research projects. With the help of three Professors from the University of Akron, we each evaluated every one of the 50-75 projects that survived the competition to the board-level evaluation. We then selected the top ten projects annually, and spent a second weekend in the spring inducting those responsible for the projects into the National Gallery for America's Young Inventors annually. In total, I spent about 120 hours working for the National Museum of Education annually. The National Museum of Education recruited me for this honor because I won the Christopher Columbus Awards, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, in 2003. My team and I tested and improved the process of mortality composting, later implementing the process in farms across Ohio., Premedical student group member I am a member of the campus premedical organization, Miami M.E.D, in an effort to expose myself to as many experiences and to as much information within the medical field as possible during the school year. I have enjoyed becoming more involved with this group's events during the past year, where I attended lectures, activities, and service events with great excitement. I most appreciate the opportunity to network with other students who are at all different stages in their Undergraduate careers but are also pursuing medicine. The advice from seniors is invaluable and I, in turn, treasure the opportunity to advise freshman and sophomores., Preceptorship I shadowed Dr. Friedman, a Columbus Allergist, as a Miami University Preceptee for one week. During this time, I was immersed in a typical week at his practice and learned about many aspects of delivering medical care. I also followed him as he volunteered at a free allergy clinic and as he gave a talk to a group pediatric practice. I enjoyed the opportunity to learn about his research and participate in the scientific community. We discussed research throughout the week, and I came to appreciate the reality of life as a physician scientist. My other shadowing experiences were only single days and with different physicians each time, so I was able to get to know Dr. Friedman on a personal and a professional level. He treats and cares for patients of all ages, socioeconomic statuses, and immunilogical problems. I was most inspired during my time with Dr. Friedman because of his outstanding interaction with patients and the particular effort he makes to know every one of his friends, as he calls each of his patients. I have since shadowed him twice more and have found his mentorship invaluable as I pursue my own path in becoming a physician., Environmental Advocate and Activist I work with Green Oxford to make Miami's campus become more sustainable. As a freshman, I helped merge two smaller campus organizations, the Green Oxford and the Environmental Action Coalition (EAC) to become a larger and more influential group. As a Sophomore, I was the Activities chair and helped recruit more than 30 freshman, giving us much more influence on campus policy and on the students. During the same year, I furthered on-campus recycling and publicized green initiatives. That year's principal accomplishment was conceiving and then transitioning campus to-go containers from non-recyclable plastic containers to biodegradable, recyclable paper containers. We succeeded through a great deal of communication with administration and the departments of housing, dining, and campus physical facilities. I will build upon the connections I made during that process to achieve my next goal of establishing a trial composting program for the University's dining halls. Doing this will require heavy student participation, significant funding, and the support of the administration and dining hall staff. However, this newest green initiative will drastically reduce waste and can produce beneficial fertilizer for the campus and Oxford community., Lab Technician/Field Researcher, Summer Internship I worked as a Lab Technician under Dr. Kevin Pangle, creating a large database by summarizing and extrapolating field fishery data. In this project, I used Microsoft Excel, as well as such specilaized computer programs as SeaDAS, ArcGIS, and MATLAB. Our main goal throughout the summer was to determine where the highest populations of fish existed in our area of focus in Lake Erie, and why they existed there. To do this, we used maps from NASA to create annual fall and spring maps of algae coverage and temperature, beginning in 1995. We then integrated the data we found with population data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. The resultant data and figures were later published as the presentation listed below. I also helped matintain experimental populations of yellow perch in the lab, collecting behavior and growth data. In the field, I learned to take water quality and fish population samples in several lakes throughout Northern Ohio and I often worked with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in their research.  Co-authored presentation: Pangle, K. L., S. Shaw, S. Blake, S. Friedberg, J. Tyson, and S. Ludsin. 2010. Using satellite imagery for Lake Erie fisheries management. Presented at the Lake Erie -- Inland Waters Annual Research Review, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH., Undergraduate Research in Botany In an independent study, I evaluated and categorized the phenotypes of hundreds of samples of Thelypteris (ferns) in attempt to designate a new species under Dr. R. James Hickey of the Miami University Botany Department. The goal of the project was to find a specific character that two species shared in order to determine a third species. My overall result was inconclusive, but I quickly learned the skills of organized research, consistent multivariate data collection, and statistical analysis., Scholar Leader Last year, I applied for and was chosen to be a Scholar Leader, a highly selective living learning community on Miami's campus. Scholar Leader is very focused on academics, leadership, and community involvement. I helped design the residential environment with my peers and we were self-governed. We held an all-Honors community competition called Geek Week, planned several homecoming events, had talks with several professors and the President of Miami, created a campus-wide motivational event before finals called MU Smiles Day, and many other events throughout the year. We were also very supportive of the events our members held through other organizations. For example,  I was able to lead several successful trail cleanups with the help of my Scholar Leader peers., Leadership positions in AEPhi My participation in AEPhi, a recently re-established sorority at Miami, has been multifaceted:  (1) Fall 2009: As the Vice President of New Member Education, I taught a class of New Members the rich history of AEPhi. They attended cultural and service activities on campus to become involved with the campus community. My seven-week program focused on leadership, teamwork, academics, and community service. All members of the class were successful, well-rounded matriculates and scored above 95% on their final exams. (2) Fall, Spring 2009: As Panhellenic Delegate, I represented AEPhi in the Greek community as a policy maker and planner. I involved all members of AEPhi in community service projects and Greek events, making our very new sorority a prominent and influential member of the Greek community. As Greek Week Chair, I organized and trained teams for ten Greek Week events and coordinated the winning donation to the Greek Week food drive. (3) Fall 2008: As Scholarship Chair, I implemented academics-based educational programs, study tables, and a novel peer-tutoring program. This program improved our academic standing within the Greek community and focused our members on their class work. As Alumni Chair, I made initial contacts with our recently graduated Alumni and our first event was a huge success., Undergraduate Research Assistant- Neuroendocrinology My project in Dr. Callahan's neurendocrinology laboratory is to study the regulation of prolactin secretion. We primarily investigate the stress response of post partum mice to understand the mediating role of prolactin in times of stress and how prolactin affects maternal behavior. I have learned several basic cell, molecular, and biochemical research techniques such as performing PCR and gel electrophoresis, taking tissue and blood samples, entering data, building IV cannulas, observing and participating in IV cannula and ovariectomy surgeries, and animal care and ethics. I am further exposed to the field by reading and discussing articles with the grad students and the advising professor weekly, thus learning about and experiencing experimental design firsthand.,  Restaurant,  Restaurant"

    "text": "Pote'm, pote'm! the children playfully demanded. I don't often interact with large numbers of children, but I quickly learned that this was their way of telling me to pick them up. It was fascinating to see how these orphans crossed the language barrier and pulled me into their world.  Using their little arms, they would tug on my clothes and hold their hands up to the sky, just waiting for their turn to be held and coddled. That's all they wanted. No matter how many toys we offered them, they would lay them down and asked to be held. We had their undivided attention. They were oblivious to the heat of the island and didn't even notice the stench of sweat and despair that filled the air.     During my medical mission trip to Haiti, it was overwhelming to confront the reality that many children are not sufficiently loved and haven't received the attention they need. Love and affection are imperative to the mental stability of a child, but as I laughed and chased them around the orphanage, I examined them physically as well. Their hands, feet, knees and elbows were calloused. Many of them had abrasions all over their bodies that had not been attended. Their teeth were either decayed or non-existent all together. Over half of the orphanage had hernias that caused their belly buttons to protrude nearly an inch from their stomachs. A handful of children had physical deformities that restricted their ability to interact within the orphanage. These orphans were separated from the rest of the population and had some form of debilitating syndrome that left them wheel-chair bound, which caused their extremities to become atrophied. Many of them just held our hands and smiled, because physical contact was scarce in their world.      Even with all of these physical ailments, we watched as many giggled, ran around on the gravel, climbed trees and begged for attention. Their sad laments seemed to vanish the moment our truck started to climb the rocky hill leading to their facility. We entertained them for hours and hours, and the experience was life-changing for me. It was irrelevant that we didn't speak their language, because we seemed to understand each other completely. As I played with the children, I realized that medical school would be my vehicle towards healing those in physical need.    Our team consisted of; a doctor from the Ukraine; a Physicians Assistant from California; two nurses from New York and a small group of pre-medical students. As we made our way to different destinations in Port-au-Prince, we noticed that the men, women and children outside of the orphanage were in dire need as well. Many hadn't seen a doctor in years and learned to live with their condition. During one of our visits, I was able to shadow Nicole Wilson, the Physician Assistant in our group, as she diagnosed hundreds of patients. One patient was an eleven-year-old boy living with a golf-ball sized cyst on his wrist. Nicole prepared aseptic tools to cut and remove the fluid. Unfortunately, it was filled with a semisolid material that would not come out. Since she didn't have the necessary tools to perform surgery, she promised to return and remove the cyst. Even then, she formed a relationship with the patient and knew she would come back to Haiti for a follow-up procedure.     This is the essence of medicine. Physicians should be willing to overcome any obstacle to help the patient. We tried endlessly to lessen their suffering, but when you're far from any medical facilities, you learn to adapt to what you have. Our group utilized every ounce of supplies and medications that we had available, and it was because of Nicole's abilities that we succeeded in treating so many individuals. As hundreds of patients made their way into the clinics, we made it a priority to have everything translated carefully, as opposed to handing over medicine and sending them on their way. It was our goal to share our knowledge so they could apply it to themselves in the future.    It became apparent that the patients appreciated this gesture. By connecting with them in this manner, I could see their hope being restored. I'm confident that I will continue this patient communication in my future. When people ask me why I want to be a doctor, I tell them they should instead ask, Why do you want this specific knowledge With this knowledge, I can explore the patient-doctor relationship and achieve a personal connection with my patients. I have an intuitive nature that drives my passion for the complexities of medicine. In Haiti, we were faced with so many devastating health issues, and I realized that pursuing a career in medicine will enable me to alleviate some of this blatant suffering.    Pote'm! Their words interrupted my thoughts and I gave in, swooping two children into my arms at once. I laughed so hard, because they always squealed when I would start running. I treasure those moments, because even if it was just short-lived, the children were momentarily happy. So much can happen in a day. Now imagine how much can happen in ten days while treating patients in the poorest nation in the western hemisphere. Kasavita Board Member After my medical mission team returned from Haiti, many of us were motivated to do more for this country. Nicole Wilson, a Physicians Assistant from California, founded Kasavita. This non-profit organization promotes public health and education where there is need. Our first goal is to set up a long term clinic in Haiti where we can have a permanent residence and our own follow-up patients. For now, I serve on the Board of Kasavita and will help make decisions regarding the future of the organization. In the next year or so, we hope to start construction of the clinic. Eventually, I would be honored to serve as an M.D. at the clinic for a few weeks each year., Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship During summer 2010, I participated in the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center SURF. This ten week program provided hands-on research experience in one of their biomedical laboratories. I was matched with a Molecular Immunologist, Dr. Edith Janssen, for the duration of my experience. This was an invaluable summer for me as a pre-medical student, because it enabled me to see the research side of medicine. In Dr. Janssen's lab, she focuses on dendritic cells and how they are activated to secrete different cytokines. I performed different techniques including ELISA, Bioassays and Western Blotting. I was reminded that research is patience, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Cincinnati., People's Clinic Volunteer Every Tuesday after class, I volunteered for two hours at this free clinic in Morehead. I have become close friends with the secretaries, and they always had a specific job set aside for me. I called patients who are expected the following week to remind them of their appointments and to bring proof of income. I usually called and spoke to about thirty-five people each week. I love this aspect, because it gave me the opportunity to practice patient communication. Although my Spanish is limited, I occasionally needed to translate for Latin patients coming through the clinic. I really enjoyed my volunteer work with this organization, and I loved being a part of their amazing team.,  Hostess, In-Surgery Medical Shadowing I had the privilege of shadowing a respected plastic surgeon in Kettering, Ohio. Throughout my two weeks with Dr. Rigano, I was able to observe procedures such as: tummy tucks, liposuction, breast implants and breast reductions. When I recall this shadowing experience, there is one patient I will never forget. The man was a victim of a dog attack, and his lower lip had been bitten off. After many weeks of painful procedures, I was able to watch as Dr. Rigano give the patient his lip back. Like this man, each patient had a unique story to tell. It was phenomenal to watch Dr. Rigano transform so many lives in just two weeks., Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity I rushed Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity during the fall semester of my sophomore year. Our co-educational brotherhood aims to bring the most academically-motivated students together to promote scholarship, fellowship and leadership. Throughout my three years in PSP, I was involved with: Relay for Life; Adopt a Highway; school supply drives for Rodburn Elementary in Morehead; a canned food drive where we collected over 400 cans for the Morehead Food Bank; and campus fundraising for our philanthropy called Teach for America. It has been a busy couple of years, but I have loved every minute of it. It's a great organization filled with the most promising students on campus., Undergraduate Research Fellowship I was awarded an Undergraduate Research Fellowship in the Biology Department under Dr. Michael Fultz. Our focus was studying the effect of Rho Kinase inhibition on smooth muscle contractions. Throughout my two years, I spent most of my time feeding and splitting cells, then preparing them to be mounted on slides for our study. I have become very knowledgeable on aseptic technique, and I am more confident in the lab. I presented my work at last year's Kentucky Academy of Science meeting at Western Kentucky University and won first place in the physiology poster section. My work with Dr. Fultz was very enlightening, and it definitely prepared me for my summer research fellowship at the UC., Haiti Medical Mission Trip In December of 2009, I joined God's Chosen Ones Ministry to create a medical mission team to go to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. We were able to treat 1,000 patients in various areas of the city. Many towns are isolated and severely lack health care, so we spent many hours traveling to them. I organized the medications table and prepared bags for patients to take home. With the advice of the medical professionals in the group, I prepared samples of different medications that could treat a number of cases. For example, I mixed 75% water and 25% hydrogen peroxide with cotton balls so women could wash themselves properly. It was incredible to see how the bare minimal can be used for so many patients., Leading Edge Program Leading Edge was a new leadership program that started in the fall of 2009 and was sponsored by the Office of Student Activities. Only twenty participants were accepted into the program and completed a structured year-long experience, including 15 hours of community service that developed our leadership skills. Each student was given a mentor, which was a great networking opportunity. I was paired with Dr. Edward Scott, a Geriatrics Physician at the Morehead Clinic. From October 2009 through November 2009, I was able to shadow Dr. Scott every week for two hours. It was such a fun experience for me because I loved visiting with elderly patients., Beta Beta Beta Biological Honor Society Morehead State University established the Phi Theta chapter of Beta Beta Beta National Biological Honor Society in the fall of 2009. After semesters of procedural meetings, my class was inducted into this prestigious organization, and we were very excited to get involved. I was elected President for our first year and I collaborated with individuals from the Chemistry Club, Physics Club, and the Environmental Club to plan events. We also organized a fundraising event where we sold recycled lab coats, and we created a Biology tutoring schedule for all students. Our fraternity is still very young, but I hope we increased our awareness on campus and added honor to this amazing brotherhood., St. Claire's Hospital Medical Shadowing St. Claire's Hospital in Morehead has a very good reputation for involving the pre-medical students in local shadowing opportunities. Through the Area Health Education Center (AHEC) at the hospital, I was paired with Dr. William Lewis, a practicing radiologist. I observed him as he explained different diagnoses and procedures, and I watched as he studied MRI exams, CT Scans, and x-rays. I was also able to examine as he drained an abscess, performed routine mammograms, and inserted permanent IV lines in patients. This was a great opportunity for me to expand my views on medicine and prepare myself for choosing a particular field., Morehead State Leadership Program The Leadership program at Morehead State University is a great opportunity to get involved in the community and learn the necessary skills to become a future leader. Each semester, the Lead students enroll in the next level of the program that focuses on a different aspect of leadership. My favorite activity we organized each year is the Rodburn Elementary School Fall Festival. Each November, our program is responsible for planning, setting up and working the festival. This one event, which takes us all semester to plan, raises 75% of their school supplies funds. This event is a perfect way to implement our leadership skills, while relieving monetary stress from the families of Morehead., Morehead State Intramurals Throughout high school, I was an all-area hitter for the varsity volleyball team. Athletics has always been a year-round commitment in my life, but I knew I wanted to focus on my studies in college. That didn't stop me from playing as many intramural sports as possible. Since my freshman year, I played soccer every fall and volleyball every spring. When I was in Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity, we were always creating teams to compete in each sport. I was constantly being called by a fellow brother to play in a game. Intramurals was another getaway opportunity for me, and it allowed me to run off some steam and spend time with my fellow students., Summer Medical and Dental Education Program Yale University awarded me a scholarship to attend SMDEP in 2009. Those six weeks in New Haven were very influential for me. It was amazing to meet so many bright and talented individuals from across the country. I made a few life-long friends and in the process, I was able to study some courses in Advanced Biology, Physics and Writing. Outside of the classroom, it was an honor to meet practicing physicians in the nearby clinics and hospital. I shadowed in the Emergency Room and also spent a lot of time at the Primary Care Center. The SMDEP program was beneficial to me as a pre-medical student. I truly appreciate everything the coordinators and students did to prepare us for medical school."

    "text": "I solve problems.  It is my nature to approach problems, whether intellectual, social, or emotional, from multiple angles in order to pursue the most promising results.  After countless hours of playing board games as a child and an excellent academic record in my high school math classes, the choice to make mathematics my college major came easily.  At the same time though, I grew up in a house full of medicine.  My mother has been a practicing physical therapist for 30 years.  She started her own private practice in our basement when I was young, introducing me to the wonders of patient care.    Once at Georgetown University, I was patient with making a decision between mathematics and medicine, choosing to pursue a bachelor's degree in mathematics while simultaneously following the pre-medical track.   While completing both course loads, I began searching for experiences that would allow me to confidently choose between math and medicine.  I volunteered in hospitals, organized fundraisers, and worked on both the administrative and clinical ends of local free clinics.  These were both rewarding and exceptional learning opportunities.  My most helpful experience arrived at the close of my junior year when I attended a research workshop in North Carolina.  The workshop, then in its eighth year, was initially created with the intention of providing students with an intensive introduction to the mathematical modeling of epidemiological data.  I anticipated the workshop to be a wonderful opportunity to sort out my rivaling passions for mathematics and medicine, and I was correct.    Throughout the week, I was presented with the opportunity to converse with Ph.D. candidates and postdoctoral research fellows, as well as professors and industry professionals.  While talking with Bruce, a postdoctoral fellow at the Statistics and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute in North Carolina, I came to a very important realization.  In response to my repeated questions regarding the possibility of integrating clinical medicine into a higher degree in mathematics he responded, My subjects are simple. To me, they are infected or not infected, a zero or a one.  I felt stunned by his reply because our approach to human subjects was so different.  This interaction illustrated, with clarity, that I was interested in a profession guided by a different paradigm.       I have always struggled with this common misconception of mathematics being so entirely concrete.  Certainly in the world of mathematical modeling, situations are ideal and therefore fall under neatly stated sets of rules.  However, when looking at real world situations, the idyllic modeling fails, requiring a more fluid and organic method of analysis in order to even come close to describing human behavior and life processes.  Herein lies the connection between mathematics and medicine: complexity.  Although it would be ideal to consider patients on a binary scale, infected or not infected, there is a multitude of variables that also affect a patient's current state of health.  The lifestyle choices and personal lives of patients impact their current state of health in powerful ways.  One cannot ignore variables such as age, family history, and socioeconomic status, to name just a few, when considering the most appropriate treatment plan.    From this simple conversation with Bruce on life perspectives, I also now realize that I do not need to choose between medicine and mathematics.  I possess the interpersonal skills necessary for individual patient care, not to mention my inherent desire to care for others.  I firmly believe in the power of human connection and the positive effects that a constructive patient-physician relationship may have on the health and well-being of both parties.  From my work in the emergency department, I have learned not only the necessity of teamwork between nurses, physicians, and hospital staff, but also between patients and their physicians in order to make a joint, and more importantly, effective decision concerning the overall health of the patient.  My vision is to integrate my mathematical reasoning abilities with my medical training, looking not only at the effects of individual patient care, but also at the overarching health trends at the population level.  Using my mathematical thinking and strong organizational skills, I plan on extending my priorities from treating immediate individual cases to examining the potential social and medical trends that may lead to prevention at the source.    Realizing the variety of opportunities available for students on the medical track, I plan on entering my medical studies with an open mind.  From my clinical and administrative experiences in health-providing environments I have confirmed my love for patient care, and from my academic endeavors I have witnessed the wonders of mathematics, science, and the human body.  From these experiences I know that I belong in the medical profession. Co-Founder Community Fundraiser After viewing the feature film Hotel Rwanda with my high school culture club in 2005, my friend and I were inspired to give back to our community in any shape or form.  Growing up in a community that glorified soccer, I worked with my longtime friend and teammate to co-found Project Passback, an annual charity soccer tournament for elementary students in our community.  Our aim was for students to participate in an activity that they loved while raising both money and awareness for a charitable cause.  We donated all proceeds, approximately $800-$1,000 annually, to the Passback program, an international organization that funds after-school soccer programs for underprivileged children attending inner-city schools across the United States.  We hosted the tournament for four consecutive years, until my sophomore year of college, attracting an average of 100 players and coordinating approximately 25 volunteers.  We spent approximately one month in the planning process, devoting 10 hours per week during the month of mid-May to mid-June each summer.  From this experience, I learned the importance of fundraising, community involvement, and the organizational skills necessary to host a safe and successful community event., National Jesuit Honor Society Alpha Sigma Nu inductions are particularly competitive, accepting only juniors and seniors in the top 15% of their class who have demonstrated an impressive record of service and loyalty to the Jesuit ideals of education.  From the initial applicant pool, only 1.2 % of students are ultimately invited to join the Georgetown chapter of Alpha Sigma Nu, translating to only 41 juniors and seniors combined for the Spring of 2010.  As a member, I attend monthly lectures given by distinguished faculty and staff, as well as speakers from the community including scientists, advocates, and politicians.  Alpha Sigma Nu gatherings also provide an open forum in which the discussion and planning of service projects and education advocacy are highly encouraged and supported., Peer Advisor As a peer advisor, I was assigned to guide two to three incoming freshman, in which our mathematics major and premedical goals were similar, through the high school-college transition period.  As their mentor, I provided my advisees with academic advice and social resources, as well as a trusted peer with whom they were able to discuss their concerns and excitement upon joining the Georgetown community.  Although the majority of communication between myself and my advisees occurred during the summer months of July and August, I continued to serve as a point of contact throughout the remainder of my advisees' careers at Georgetown.  Entrance into the Peer Advisor program is based on a written application and commitment to the program, with the intent of providing the support necessary to the incoming class of freshman in order for them to succeed at Georgetown., Family Practice Free Clinic Volunteer As an intern at the free clinic, I rotated between the clinical and administrative components of the organization.  With only one physician and two nurses on duty, I was able to observe the functioning of a small non-profit organization.  While given the opportunity to discuss individual cases with the resident physician, I also worked closely with the fundraising chair, learning the administrative proceedings involved in funding the free clinic.  The community of medical professionals and staff was extremely intimate, and their shared values and teamwork created a welcoming environment for patients and their families.  I was able to engage in conversations with the executive director, doctor, and nurses about healthcare policy and reform in the United States for members of the community below the poverty line., Bone Marrow Transplant Unit Volunteer As is required of all new volunteers, I started out at the information desk where I learned the layout of the hospital.  After a semester at the desk, I was matched to the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit with a very kind and informative nursing staff.  From the nurses and administrative assistants, I was able to observe the medical students and doctors from a perspective different than that provided from the common pre-medical shadowing opportunity.  I was able to hear firsthand both the praises and grievances of the nurses as they interacted with and without doctors -- a perspective that will be imperative to remember as I enter the medical profession.  As a volunteer, I interacted directly with patients in the form of visiting, providing information, and fulfilling patient and family requests.  I also spent time with the secretary on the floor, learning the basic concepts of administrative organization including charting and lab orders.  My volunteer participation lasted throughout the months of the academic calendar, August-May each year., Mentor Program Best Buddies is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating lasting friendships between college students and members of the community with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  As an organization, we meet once a month to have festive parties with all of the college buddy pairs.  Outside of these monthly theme parties, I keep contact with my buddies via telephone or email about once a week.  During my time as a member of Best Buddies, I have had two incredible buddies, Tracy and Fred.  Tracy taught me how to put my school work aside when I wasn't actually studying, allowing me to enjoy the time I spent with friends instead of feeling stressed about my assignments.  Fred, my current buddy, has reminded me about the powerful effects of individual care through his good natured humor and continuous deliverance of compliments.  These simple social skills are something that I know I must not lose sight of when I am working with patients as their doctor., Academic Honors Georgetown University requires academic dedication in order to succeed.  Making academics my main priority, I achieved a high enough grade point average each semester to be recognized with the following honors: First Honors (Semester GPA of 3.9 and above) Fall 2007, Spring 2009; Second Honors (Semester GPA of 3.7 and above) Spring 2008, Fall 2009, Spring 2010; Dean's List (GPA of 3.5 and above) Fall 2008.  I have received one of the aforementioned honors every semester of my career at Georgetown University., Co-President Student Service Organization HOPE is an umbrella organization encompassing eight community service groups working under the same mission statement of promoting community service, advocacy, and education regarding the local DC homeless community.   As I freshman, I served as a committee coordinator for the Hoyas 4 Healthcare 5k Run and 2k Walk focusing on volunteer recruitment.  The following year, 2008-2009, I co-coordinated the entire race, organizing weekly committee meetings to oversee advertising, sponsorship, registration, and race-day logistics.  The race attracted over 50 runners and 50 more volunteers generating just over $1,000 for the Health Outreach for Youth and Adults (HOYA) Clinic, a free-clinic in Southeast, DC run by the students and staff of Georgetown University Medical School.  Since then I have been elected Co-chair of HOPE as a whole, leading weekly sessions geared towards recruiting Georgetown students to participate in any, or all, of our service programs.  My responsibilities involve developing and managing budgets for each of the eight service groups, in which funding from the university amounts in approximately $2,000 annually.  I lead weekly meetings to help coordinators develop their individual programs.  HOPE reaches over 1,000 members of the student body weekly via online and direct communication., Public Health Research Intern I developed and executed a research project with mentor Scott Frank, M.D., director of the Master of Public Health Program at Case Western Reserve University in the department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology.  The project goal was to analyze the effectiveness of the Shaker Prevention Coalition, an organization in Shaker Heights, Ohio dedicated to enhancing the human infrastructure of the community through youth development, promotion of healthy choices, and substance abuse prevention.  The longitudinal analysis was based off of data taken from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey that students at the high school and middle school have completed annually for the past eight years.  The survey contains questions pertaining to substance abuse, stress, and sexual behavior, with an emphasis on student and parent attitudes toward such matters.  After creating a data dictionary of the existing data, we generated research questions as the basis for our statistical analysis.  As our research efforts will continue into the fall, we will finish the project by writing an executive summary.  We currently have approval from the American Association of Public Heath to attend their Annual Meeting & Exposition where we will present our findings., Captain, Club Soccer I was accepted onto the club soccer team in the fall of my freshman year, where I attempted to maintain a healthy exercise routine and to build social relationships with my Georgetown peers amidst my challenging academic load.  The team participates in a fall and spring season, spanning three months each.  After three semesters as an avid and dedicated member, I was elected as one of two captains of the team, a position I maintained from the Spring season of 2008 through the Fall season of 2009.  As captain, I served as a coach figure for weekly practices, games, and tournaments to a roster of 45 players.  I organized and conducted three weekly practices, each an hour and a half in length, and travelled with the team every weekend to neighboring universities in the Washington, DC/Maryland/Virginia area.  Additional responsibilities included organizing seasonal tryouts for over 60 players.  As captain, I attended two meetings per month with the other student officers (president, vice president, treasurer, and social chair) in order to keep our organization running efficiently.  Through my experiences in club soccer I learned efficient time management and leadership skills, all while maintaining my physical health and creating supportive relationships with my teammates and fellow officers., Emergency Department Volunteer Mentee to Thomas Graber, M.D., Chairman, Department of Emergency Medicine, St. Vincent Charity Hospital, Chief Medical Officer West of TeamHealth Midwest, and Clinical Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.  Under his supervision, I participate in individual case reviews and discussion of not only the medicine, but the psychology of caregiving.  Approximately half of my time was spent serving as an apprentice to the medical technician on duty, learning and performing medical basics including wound-cleaning, electrocardiograms, vital sign collection, blood drawing, patient transport, and fulfillment of patient and family requests.  The emergency department staff treated me as an integral member of their team, allowing me to experience the functioning of a medical department from various perspectives, as well as the confidence to assume responsibility for the aforementioned contributions.  My time commitment was during the summer months only., Undergraduate Mathematical Modeling Workshop The undergraduate modeling workshop, funded by the National Science Foundation, focused primarily on SAMSI research activities related to the statistical and applied mathematical modeling and analysis of epidemiological data.  The first day of the seven day conference was spent at SAMSI receiving lectures, performing computer laboratories, and conversing with Ph.D. candidates and postdoctoral research fellows about their particular mathematical research.  In the subsequent days, students were introduced to two mathematical coding programs, R and MATLAB, along with detailed instructions on dealing with large data sets.  Presentations included the topics of space-time analysis for environmental mapping, climate change, and stochastical dynamics, with the largest attention paid to epidemiological models and data sets.  The conference culminated in a small-group project, where students were required to analyze the available data on the past ten years of influenza data from the Centers for Disease Control using the mathematical and statistical software presented throughout the week.  Each group prepared a 20 minute presentation of their developed questions and subsequent analysis.  The conference served as an intensive introduction to research methods concerning epidemiological data and modeling."

    "text": "The embodiment of compassion, commitment, and integrity is fundamentally embedded in every successful physician. A selfless disposition and personification of a servant's heart are characteristic of good doctors. These qualities are a source of inspiration and are the epitome of what I hope to one day become. Throughout my summers as a medical assistant at Greenleaf Orthopaedic Associates and having grown up the daughter of a physician, I gradually came to grasp the full-time, around-the-clock requirements of being a physician. I believe this profession requires more than mere knowledge, a title, and generically helping people; it entails the selfless act of placing the needs of others above your own. Sometimes it means missing an elaborate Christmas dinner, a daughter's dance recital, or a son's soccer game to perform emergency surgery. It may involve returning to the hospital at three in the morning, after just arriving home an hour or two earlier. I have observed first-hand that practicing medicine often requires sacrificing your time to meet the needs of others and a sincere desire to not only ease the suffering, but also improve the quality of life of your patients.   As a medical assistant, I have witnessed doctor-patient interactions and learned valuable lessons regarding the treatment of patients. I removed casts for patients aged two to ninety-four and removed sutures and staples following a variety of surgeries. Through this work experience, I not only gained basic medical knowledge, but developed communication skills by interacting professionally, yet personally with patients and confidently with insurance companies and pharmacies. Witnessing doctors strive daily to alleviate the suffering of their patients inspired me to dedicate my life toward that same goal.  Furthermore, I have learned to view patients as more than mere numbers, statistics or diseases, but as human beings. This distinction was evident at the Ronald McDonald House as I interacted with children receiving cancer treatment. In mid-October, I volunteered for pumpkin carving, where I collaborated with the kids, helping select a design or simply assisting with carving. Working side-by-side with the children reminded me that, while cancer patients, they possess the same basic thoughts and desires as any other child. In the same way, my interaction with patients at Central Regional Psychiatric Hospital demonstrated that although these patients may have a severe disorder, they are identical to every other person in wanting to play bingo, win prizes, and talk about their families. Through these collective experiences, I have been encouraged to do more than just fight disease, I have been inspired to strive to improve these individuals' lives.   Interacting with physicians and patients has illuminated the importance of compassion and reassurance in a doctor's disposition. I have seen patients apprehensive as they entered a doctor's office or hospital. A doctor's ability to explain a problem, disease, or surgery calmly, in a way the patient can understand, is crucial in helping to assuage their fears. Similarly, my experience as a peer tutor has improved and refined my communication skills; taking a complex concept and explaining it in an intelligible way is vital in both successful tutoring and in the field of medicine.   Working as a medical assistant in an orthopedic practice, volunteering at hospitals and the Ronald McDonald House, peer tutoring, and taking core and upper-level biology, chemistry, and anatomy courses have equipped me with knowledge and skills that will help provide a strong foundation for medical school. Additionally, I have realized the importance of selfless sacrifice, empathy, compassion and reassurance as essential attributes in a physician's character as they treat and improve the quality of life of their patients. I have an unwavering commitment and wholehearted desire to become a physician. The complex nature of being a doctor presents an imposing challenge, but it is one that I am eager to undertake. Shadowing/Medical Assistant/Volunteer - Summer 2008 and Summer 2010  The HealthReach Clinic is a free clinic which serves low income, uninsured patients not on public aid, and who often speak little to no English. I shadowed a physician and assisted when possible at the clinic. This experience provided me with the opportunity to observe a diverse group of patients from a variety of cultures. I gained insight into the patients' various life situations, some of which were dire, as they struggled with limited medical care and little to no money., Medical Assistant As a medical assistant, I interacted with patients and physicians. My responsibilities included: removal of casts, splints, dressings, staples, sutures; filling injections; placing prescription orders; communicating with insurance companies; and assisting physicians in application of casts, as well as with other requests. This experience provided the opportunity to not only increase my knowledge of medicine, but also interact with patients on a professional and personal level. I was inspired by the joy and enthusiasm the patients exhibited as they recovered from surgery and were able to resume an active lifestyle.   In addition to Summer 2008, I also worked full-time as a medical assistant the summer before my freshman year (Summer 2007) and the winter break during my freshman year (Winter 2007-2008)., Volunteer At Central Regional Hospital, I interacted with a variety of psychiatric patients through conversations, playing games, and organizing activities. Their favorite activity was bingo, and it was sure to draw the largest number of patients. Over the course of the semester, I realized that despite their unusual behaviors, they ultimately had the same desires as everyone else. They wanted to have someone to talk to and interact with; and of course, they really wanted to win at bingo., Undergraduate Lab Volunteer At the C.A. Pound Human Identification Lab, I assisted Dr. Warren and the graduate students with their forensic cases and performed miscellaneous tasks around the lab. I spent the majority of my time taking and developing dental x-rays, photographing skeletal remains, and making molds and casts of specific bones. I also had the opportunity to watch two necropsies (a cat and a dog) by a forensic vet associated with the ASPCA.  I gained exposure to laboratory techniques and procedures in the field of forensic anthropology. I was able to apply my knowledge of anatomy and osteology in practical ways., Dean's List I have received the following honors: - 2007 Fall Dean's List - 2008 Fall Dean's List with Distinction - 2009 Fall Dean's List with Distinction - 2010 Spring Dean's List  Dean's List: This honor signifies that I earned a semester grade point average securing a placement in the top one-third of undergraduates in Trinity College.  Dean's List with Distinction: This honor signifies that I earned a semester grade point average securing a placement in the top ten percent of undergraduates in Trinity College., Shadowing a Surgeon I shadowed an orthopaedic surgeon in both a clinical office setting and surgery. In the clinical setting, I observed the physician perform the history and physical examination, interpret x-rays, make a diagnosis, and formulate a plan of treatment. I also benefited from seeing improvement in many patients at their follow-up visits. In surgery, I observed a bilateral total knee replacement. I witnessed not only the role of the surgeon, but also the responsibilities of operating room personnel, such as the anesthesiologist, the surgical nurse, and the surgical technicians. These collective experiences allowed me to more fully understand the long-term care of patients., Volunteer I volunteered at the Ronald McDonald House of Durham doing arts and crafts or other activities with the young cancer patients and their families. Painting water color pictures, making cookies, and pumpkin carving for Halloween were among my favorite activities.   This experience illustrated that although these children were cancer patients, they had the same thoughts and desires as healthy children. I realized that these children were more than just patients or statistics; they were ordinary kids who enjoyed laughing, playing and creating., Volunteer I volunteered in the Emergency Department at Duke University Hospital for a total of 20 hours. My position entailed conversing with patients about their ER experiences and recording any complaints. In addition, I also tried to help make them comfortable during their stay in the emergency room.   As a result, I better understand a patient's emergency room experience. I learned to empathize with their complaints, and accommodate their needs to the best of my abilities.,  Medical assistant, Student Leader/Member The Duke Navigators is a Christian religious organization on campus. As a member, I participate in the weekly large group meeting. In addition, we also host weekly small groups. I have been a student leader since May 2009. In this position, I assist in the overall logistical planning for the large group sessions and the organization and facilitation of a weekly small group. One of my most important roles is to ensure that everyone's opinions and ideas are heard., Viennese Ball Chair/Member The Duke Wind Symphony is composed of undergraduates, graduate students, and community members. I enjoy playing my French horn as a creative outlet and a break from my academic studies. We rehearse at least twice a week, and perform two or three concerts per semester.   This past winter, I was elected to the Executive Board as Viennese Ball Chair for the calendar year. I am responsible for planning and organizing this annual fund-raising event.   Through these experiences, I have strengthened my organizational skills and long-term planning ability.  Additionally, I have learned the importance of delegating tasks in a responsible manner., Volunteer The National Junior Disability Championships is an opportunity for over 300 young athletes to compete in seven athletic events over the course of eight days. All of the athletes have a significant physical or visual disability. As a volunteer, I worked in the concession stand and as a timer for the wheelchair basketball competition. It was an uplifting experience to witness these athletes overcome many obstacles, excel at sports and enjoy competition.,  tutor, Peer Tutor While tutoring students weekly in General Physics, I explained course concepts, reviewed for exams, and worked though example problems. I attempted to facilitate their learning experience by being available as an additional resource to answer questions and clarify material. Through these sessions, I found that each student understands concepts in a different manner. As a result, I realized that communicating an idea in a variety of ways is essential for successful comprehension."

    "text": "How is it possible to coldly separate a medical procedure from the patient who requires it  I found myself asking this question one day in a biomedical engineering lecture.  I enjoyed the opportunity my major gave me to pursue my love for science and mathematics, but something was missing.  After a lecture over the mechanics of knee implants, I was thrilled to learn that we would be watching a knee replacement surgery at the end of class!  I hoped the movie would give me insight into the patient's reason for needing a knee replacement, or the pain that drove him to surgical intervention.  However, the film was a cold depiction of the prosthesis insertion, with no mention of the patient.  In that moment I realized that I did not want to design the equipment, but wanted to interact with the people receiving it and support them through the difficulties they would face.  The following day, I spoke with my adviser about switching my major to Biological Sciences and adding a minor in Psychology in order to help me achieve this goal.  The importance of focusing on people as individuals and supporting others in ways that can best be achieved through personalized understanding followed me through college.  As a tutor, I learned to understand the perspective of another person and find a unique was to solve his or her academic problems.  Regardless of the student, what seemed to be the most helpful was to find the method that was best suited for his or her needs.  Leah, for example, was a student who came to me for help in math.  After explaining the material, I watched as she completed problem after problem correctly every session.  Curious, I finally asked her why she had been performing poorly in class.  She told me that she understood the information better when she could work through it as a team than when she was being instructed, as the latter caused her anxiety.  She taught me that helping someone succeed requires not only giving them the aid they need, but also making them comfortable during the process.  In addition to tutoring, the Ethics Bowl showed me how to help others achieve success through teamwork and individual understanding.  With a wide variety of students with several different majors, each one of us had a unique style of learning and stress reduction.  Each team member grew to learn about the needs of the others and the approach that would most help them.  We would work collectively to support each other through the entire process while still keeping it personal.  In addition, the Ethics Bowl presented an opportunity to analyze situations that will be prominent in my future career as a physician.  As the only pre-medicine student on the team, I was generally assigned to resolve cases dealing with medical issues, such as health care for illegal immigrants and slow medicine elderly care.  I believe this experience has primed me for the group learning environment of not only medical school, but medical practice as well.  Shadowing a family practice physician further showed me the importance of focusing not simply on the matter at hand, but on the patient as an individual with unique circumstances.  When Dr. Fedrizzi stepped out of an examining room for a moment to take a phone call, one patient told me her story.  After a long struggle with several doctors unsure of how to treat her depression symptoms, she was going to consider herself a hopeless cause, until she met Dr. Fedrizzi.  The patient beamed with an energy that was contagious as she talked about how Dr. Fedrizzi had not only treated her symptoms, but also helped her understand the personal issues that had caused her symptoms.  She made me promise her to do the same as my mentor in my future practice, and not only treat the condition but to also support the person.  This, I thought to myself, is what I hope to leave behind in this world - knowing that I have touched someone's life in a way that no other profession could and to reach out to him or her beyond the confines of my professional obligations.  Not just the condition, the medical equipment, the math problem, or the competition case, but the person. Discharge Escort As a discharge escort, I escorted patients out of the hospital when their stay was over and assisted new patients to their rooms., Golden Key International Honor Society Member As a member of this society, I was involved with several community service projects including Habitat for Humanity and the St. Vincent de Paul Halloween Party.  As the book drive coordinator, I organized a campus-wide book drive twice a year in order to raise funds for the organization.  The books were donated to various charities and helped those charities give back to the community as well.,  Cashier/Hostess/Server, Math and Science Tutor I tutored students in algebra, chemistry, and biology.  I worked with them to enhance their understanding of class materials and coached basic study strategies.,  Special Events Manager, Haunted House Volunteer The Civil Air patrol organized a haunted house in order to raise money for the organization.  I participated as an actress in the haunted house., Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl Team Member The Ethics Bowl is an intercollegiate competition where schools are assigned a list of cases that deal with ethical issues that apply to the world today.  Each team is responsible for resolving these cases and presenting their arguments at the competition.  As a premedical student, I was generally assigned to the medical issues.  I debated several cases with other teams at both the regional and national levels.  This year, we attended the national competition and placed sixth out of two-hundred teams.  I will be returning next year as the team captain., Special Events Manager The Pillaged Village is a small business associated with the Society for Creative Anachronism, a Medieval Reenactment group.  Working there from a young age, I progressed to the rank of Special Events Manager.  Every summer, I reenact with this group while managing the store.  I supervise employees during travel and special events such as this event, create work schedules, resolve both customer and employee disputes, and fill and ship online orders., Presidential Commendation for Excellence This award was administered as recognition for success as a member of the Ethics Bowl Team.  I also received this award in May 2009., Troupe Member Troupe is a campus organization that allows students who are not majoring in theater to participate in stage performance.  I was one of the founding members of this organization when it started in 2009 and continue to be involved today.  The organization has performed mainly short skits that have been written and performed solely by the students in the organization., Shadowing While shadowing, I was able to assist the medical assistants with blood pressure readings, recording prescription refill needs, and evaluating depression/anxiety scales.  I also discuss lipid analysis results with patients and organize and complete medical charts.  While following Dr. Fedrizzi, I have learned a great deal about the requirements to work within the medical field., Server/Hostess/Cashier While working at Bob Evans, I handled monetary transactions, administered customer service, and distributed prepared food to the customers."

    "text": "Ten operations over the course of two decades, my sense of hearing, and a profound appreciation of medicine are testaments to my surgeon's tireless efforts and inexhaustible optimism. I admired his honesty, compassion, and professionalism throughout the disheartening setbacks to seal my perforated eardrums and remedy the collateral damage resulting from countless ear infections. As frightening as surgery and the specter of deafness were, the experience profoundly influenced my beliefs and aspirations. The whole time, I looked up to the youthful and relatable residents who were learning the necessary skills and knowledge to practice medicine. I also recognized progress in the science of healing manifest as subtle improvements in surgical procedure, general anesthesia, and recovery time. Certainly, I have come to regard interactions between medicine, technology, and education as truly remarkable and fundamental to the advancement of patient health and well-being.  The capacity of technology to improve the human condition is best characterized by the ongoing digital revolution. The unprecedented access to knowledge granted by the internet continues to expand my perception of the world and complement my natural curiosity. More broadly, it has enabled the exploration of complex biological systems that are presenting unique opportunities to manage patient care. I consider genomic medicine to be one of the most promising avenues for advances in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of human disease. I am hopeful that by delivering personalized genetic information, I may inspire patients to seize an active role in furthering their own wellness. Medical school will shift my role from spectator to participant and enable me to translate the molecular etiology of human disease from the bench to the bedside. With patient care my top priority and my hand on the pulse of technological progress, I look forward to complementing my undergraduate academics and research with the clinical and practical aspects of medical school.  I developed a keen interest in genomics and acquired a concrete understanding of molecular biology over the course of three and a half years researching the molecular mechanisms of peroxisome proliferation. The research lab fostered my education, appealed to my interest in innovative biotechnology and encouraged me to pursue leadership opportunities. The project at Pacific Northwest National Lab was a cross-disciplinary approach that included engineering a microfluidic flow system with the aim of enhancing the capture of waterborne toxins using antibody-coupled magnetic nanoparticles. The independent nature of the project refined my problem solving skills and contributed to my love for the scientific process. Ultimately though, the palpable absence of practical applications for people reinforced my desire to integrate emerging technology with the practice of medicine and directly benefit the lives of patients.  Later that year, I moved from the research to the clinical lab and applied my academic and research background to molecular diagnostics. The clinical lab rotation illustrated the advantages of adapting traditional assays to molecular platforms. After graduation, I joined a pathology lab near Chicago that develops and implements molecular assays ranging from infectious disease to cancer biomarkers. The lab's dedication to translational research has given me the opportunity to integrate my molecular biology experience with engineers from Northwestern University and develop a rapid, point-of-care influenza antiviral resistance assay. I am optimistic that the growing applications of molecular diagnostics for infectious diseases and pharmacogenomics are indicative of a larger trend towards molecular medicine. Through advances in technology and analytic methods, inexpensive whole genome sequencing will ultimately lead to statistically significant and clinically meaningful data. This in turn will provide physicians with the knowledge to counsel patients, enhance care, and promote the expansion of genomic medicine.  While genomic medicine could not have furthered the efforts to preserve my hearing, it certainly inspired me to emulate the skill and compassion of my surgeon and pursue medicine. The methodical organization of my undergraduate career coincides with my commitment to establish a solid foundation of basic science coupled with a sound and practical medical education. The integration of medicine and biotechnology is personified by my esteemed role model and director of the NIH, Francis Collins. I am inspired by his support for free and rapid access to information, optimism that genomic discoveries will lead to an increasingly long list of health benefits for all the world's peoples and belief that genomics is the the engine that will transform medicine. I envision myself joining a new generation of physicians eager to harness the deluge of patient-driven genomics. Moreover, I believe technology as a whole is on the brink of delivering unprecedented opportunities and benefits to physicians and patients alike. I have long recognized this prospect and aspire to maximize the clinical potential of such technology and create positive change in the world, one individual at a time. Research Associate After graduating, I accepted a research position in Dr. Karen Kaul's pathology and molecular diagnostics lab north of Chicago at Evanston Hospital. The lab develops molecular assays ranging from infectious disease to cancer biomarkers and is dedicated to translational research. Over the next 12 months in collaboration with engineers developing a mobile, point-of-care testing platform from Northwestern University, I will develop a robust molecular assay to differentiate influenza subtypes and detect antiviral drug resistance. Addressing the dynamic and variable genomic sequence of influenza while faithfully replicating the assay across multiple testing platforms will challenge my intellect and further refine my problem solving skills., Neurology and Epilepsy Clinical Shadowing Dr. Macken's eight week mentorship with me at Northwestern Memorial Hospital presented the opportunity for me to interact with patients and experience medicine from a physician's perspective. I was first introduced to the vivacious head technician who stumped me with her playful request that I interpret an intimidating-looking EEG displayed on a monitor in front of me. Nevertheless, by the end of the first week, I was acing her pop quizzes. I poignantly remember the day that Dr. Macken requested his sleep deprived patient read a magazine aloud. After only a few sentences, the EEG began undulating as she quietly stammered, hesitated for a few seconds, then looked up with a grimace on her face. I saw displayed on the EEG what she felt; the subtle hallmark of a temporal lobe seizure. I also met a lively young woman suffering from debilitating seizures undergo an intracranial operation. I watched in disbelief as the surgeon excised a golf ball sized section of brain matter. To my astonishment, I heard her talking and laughing with her family less than 24 hours later. This unique opportunity made it possible for me to connect with patients and experience the positive difference physicians make every day in the lives of patients., Pediatric Genetics Clinic I accompanied a geneticist and two genetic counselors to a pediatric genetics clinic during my Molecular Diagnostics internship. I greeted the families, interacted with patients, and observed the physician diagnose and deliver care. I was intrigued by the physician's process of evaluating new patients. He relied on a combination of knowledge, instinct, and evidence from the patient and family to determine the battery of tests to order. I noted the manner in which the genetic counselors translated the complex etiology of the patient's condition for the families. I also partook in discussions between the physician and genetic counselors regarding each patient and was impressed with collaborative approach that functioned to minimize the number of tests and efficiently pinpoint diagnoses., HIV/AIDS Alternative Spring Break I volunteered for two different organizations in the city of San Francisco. Project Open Hand prepares and delivers meals to individuals with chronic illness. Tenderloin Health provides health services to the city's homeless, poor, and most vulnerable residents living with or at risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS. Tenderloin Health was in the process of moving locations when we arrived and were in desperate need of help. We assisted in cleaning the facility and moving furniture and equipment. The staff shared their personal connections and dedication to their clients as we organized files dating back more than thirty years. They were so thankful for our assistance and offered us the opportunity to participate in the controversial needle exchange program. Throughout the evening and into the early morning, I interacted with clients and experienced firsthand San Francisco's public health policy of harm reduction., Plant Research Laboratory I was a protégé of the Hu lab and my mentors were intent on teaching me everything they could about the laboratory and research. I maintained the laboratory, ordered supplies, and tied up the loose ends of various research projects. By the end of my first year, I had learned more practical molecular biology and genomics then I would learn in the subsequent two years of classes. My second year onward, I participated directly in researching the molecular mechanisms of peroxisome proliferation in Arabidopsis. I confirmed the subcellular localization of peroxisome proteins and surveyed mutagenized lines of Arabidopsis for notable peroxisome phenotype. I was also responsible for presenting my results every eight weeks., Deans Honor List I was entered on the Dean's Honor List, Lyman Briggs College for both the fall 2009 and spring 2010 semesters, ending my undergraduate education on a high note., American Red Cross Over a precautionary cup of Kool-Aid and a couple of cookies, kindhearted strangers opened up to me and shared their motivation to dedicate their day to give blood. I found their altruism charming as it shined through their nonchalant demeanor. In addition, the subtle delight of friendly small talk was an added bonus and a welcomed change of pace from academics and research.,  Research,  Research, Department of Homeland Security Research Experience The DHS HS-STEM Summer Internship Program provides students with the opportunity to conduct research in DHS mission-relevant research areas at federal research facilities. At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, I was responsible for optimizing antibody coupling to magnetic nanoparticles as well as evaluating the sensitivity, limit of detection, and suitability of those nanoparticle-antibody complexes. I also collaborated with a graduate student from the University of Washington to engineer a microfluidic flow system that was designed to enhance biological agent concentration, purification, and detection. The project was part of a larger US Coast Guard initiative intended to protect the country's water supply from threats related to bioterrorism. The independent nature of the experience fostered my resourcefulness and was pivotal in my academic development., Internal Medicine Elective This experience introduced me to the practice of primary care and internal medicine. Throughout the week, I shadowed an internist and two residents as they met with patients. I was interested in learning more about the primary care profession, as it has recently been the subject of increased media attention with the passage of President Obama's 2010 healthcare overhaul amid a nationwide shortage of such physicians. Between patients and during lunch, I discussed with her the state of primary care, health insurance, and the doctor-patient relationship., Switzerland Environmental Science This study abroad is one of the few physically challenging integrated learning experiences Michigan State has to offer. While backpacking through Switzerland I gained a new perspective on environmental science and sustainable policy. The immersive and holistic experience evoked in me a deep admiration for Switzerland's national ethos of neutrality, resourcefulness, and sustainable progress. The 15 mile, eight hour hikes were peppered with lectures on biology, geology, and sustainability. I learned about Switzerland's natural heritage while sitting atop a mountain in the Swiss National Park, gazing upon the monolithic Matterhorn, and, walking across hydroelectric dams that provide more than half of the country's electricity. We explored the tragedy of the commons as we evaluated the biodiversity of a dilapidated hamlet that was suspiciously devoid of trees as a result of bygone deforestation. I left the country with a cache of Swiss Army knives and a newfound respect for motion-sensitive lighting and the awkward clang of cowbells; souvenirs embodying Switzerland's self-reliance and dedication to sustainability., Plant Genomics Research Internship This was my first official research internship where I was formally presented with a defined project. I was given a list of six putative peroxisomal genes and was responsible for confirming their localization to the peroxisome. Using the Gateway cloning system, the genes were fused with a fluorescent gene and cloned. I transformed agrobacterium with the cloned gene and transfected the leaves of tobacco plants. I then used fluorescent microscopy on the leaves to visualize whether the proteins localized to the peroxisome., Molecular Diagnostics Internship Throughout the 2009 spring semester, I rotated through four labs that utilize molecular diagnostics in a variety of healthcare applications. I began at an Immunology and Serology lab which employs specialized methods of PCR as well as microsphere-based technologies to genotype the highly polymorphic HLA loci of kidney transplant patients and donors. I then spent three weeks at a DNA Diagnostics lab processing patient samples and testing for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genetic mutations, and DNA methylation to support the diagnosis of hereditary diseases and disorders. The seven weeks at the Michigan Department of Community Heath in Lansing Michigan were spent gaining practical experience in applying molecular diagnostics to infectious disease. I genotyped influenza and E. coli using real-time PCR, performed HIV viral load assays, and sequenced HIV and tuberculosis from patients to track and assess drug resistance. While there, I also had the opportunity to observe and partake in a nationwide food contamination outbreak response with the Bureau of Epidemiology. I concluded my practical experience at a Cytogenetics lab producing karyotypes and surveying patient samples for chromosomal aberrations using fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH)., Laboratory Diagnostics Consultant While attending 2010 BIO International Convention at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois, I became acquainted with Ted Flees, a leader within the corporate strategy function at Walgreen Company. In our exchange of ideas regarding innovation in healthcare technology, we discussed the company's interest in the point-of-care testing and diagnostics space, coupled with concern regarding the company's level of knowledge from a technical prospective. This ultimately led to an invitation to join and engage with teams at Walgreens in active pursuit of emerging healthcare technology. In assessing the gaps from a technical prospective, I found that the central dogma of genetics was understood in varying degrees. It became evident that establishing a common understanding amongst various teams was essential. In addition, I provided a landscape overview of the various companies and technologies paving way in the healthcare space. My knowledge of the fundamental principles of molecular biology in combination with my experience and education in the clinical lab served as an excellent resource in the decision-making process. The experience introduced me to the business aspects of laboratory diagnostics and exercised my ability to translate and present technical material to a broader audience."

    "text": "As a student with varied interests, I have struggled to find a balance between science and the humanities. Since leaving Wesleyan, I have realized that these two aspects of my persona can be reconciled through medicine. Wesleyan, a university that provides tremendous academic freedom, afforded me an opportunity to explore my diverse interests. For someone fulfilling pre-med requirements, this was especially useful. For example, I was able to take Bioinformatics and Genomics and Art of the Aegean Bronze Age during the same semester. The academic freedom was liberating, however, I felt pulled in different directions. It took time for me to understand how to best take advantage of these different paths. In the two years since leaving Wesleyan, I have come to appreciate the connections between these two worlds. Both the humanities and the sciences examine the same basic issues pertaining to what it means to be human, albeit through different lenses. I realize now that medicine provides me a means to confront these human problems. It allows me to ask what we can do to create or alleviate situations that lead to disease. I am able to ask what impact the health of an individual has on his or her larger community and vice versa. I am interested in continuing the work that has consumed me for the last two years within homeless healthcare during training and later as a primary care physician. I believe that the manner in which a community looks after the marginalized elements of society, or to the extent that it does or does not incorporate alienated populations into its midst, is a measure of its health and its humanity. Central to this belief is the idea that communities are powerful groups that have inherent responsibilities. I am further interested in trying to understand what circumstances lead to situations whereby individuals and whole segments of communities become marginalized. Based on these ideas, I would like to pursue an MPH during my medical school training and to eventually work within the framework of a community, focusing on preventive medicine. My volunteer and work experiences during and after Wesleyan helped to develop my understanding of how to incorporate these ideas into my professional life. While at Wesleyan, I volunteered at High Hopes Therapeutic Riding Center. By providing handicapped individuals with physical and emotional therapy, High Hopes enriched their lives, but so too the lives of the counselors, volunteers, and ultimately the community that created such an opportunity. My summer in Cape Town, South Africa working to prevent mother to child HIV transmission with an organization called mothers2mothers also demonstrated the power of a community based therapeutic approach to a health problem. The organization trains HIV positive mothers to become educators and leaders within their communities. The women move from a marginalized position to an empowered one and in so doing broaden the circle of health promotion. After finishing at Wesleyan I spent a year with Americorps, serving in Washington DC at an organization called DC Central Kitchen. The Kitchen offered a number of community oriented programs, including food recycling, culinary education for the down and out, and homeless street outreach. I served as a homeless street outreach worker gaining first hand experience working with a population largely ignored by much of society. Continuing to work with urban homeless populations became an overriding passion of mine. These experiences have taught me in a graphic way how environment plays a crucial role in the causation of disease, but they have also taught me how the creation of a particular environment can play a role in the treatment and prevention of disease. To this end, I am currently pursuing a MS degree in Nutrition at Columbia University. Nutrition has allowed me to further explore areas that I was already interested in and to interface with larger health issues. As such my master's thesis project is titled 'Barriers to Adequate Nutrition Among Different Urban Homeless Populations.' For the project, I am surveying a number of different subpopulations within New York's larger homeless population. And using the analyzed the data, I will create educational materials, which will attempt to address some of the identified barriers. Additionally, I am also working with my thesis mentor to establish a community kitchen at Harlem Hospital. There classes will teach savvy and healthful grocery shopping and new cooking techniques to members of the community. While at Wesleyan, the struggle as to whether to focus on the sciences or the humanities created many challenges for me. It necessitated my taking more courses than required, which impact some of my grades. However, with hindsight I am indebted to that experience and feel committed to my chosen path. Medicine provides a skill set that will allow me to care for the wellbeing of individuals and their communities. The thought of being able to positively impact a person's health (especially one whose health has been previously neglected) is thrilling. I want to be part of a movement that confronts the health issues of our day, working on preventive measures so that the next generation does not face the same health issues that we do. Washington DC Americorps After college I did a year of Americorps service in Washingon DC. My service was based at DC Central Kitchen, a community kitchen with a number of different related programs. I served as one of 5 homeless street outreach workers. My team was responsible for outreach in DC's wards 7 and 8, two of the city's more depressed areas. Each morning we distributed breakfast to between 150-200 individuals. During breakfast I helped distribute basic needs supplies such toiletries and long johns while also writing referrals to other social service agencies. These referrals made us an important point of connection between a marginalized population and and a service community geared to helping it. In the process of serving breakfast and writing referrals I began to establish relationships with our clients. These relationships facilitated and fueled my afternoons, which in contrast to the mornings varied day to day. Operating under a harm reduction model and using techniques of motivational interviewing we connected and followed up with those who were willing. We helped people with everything from doctor appointments to housing to detoxification and recovery centers. And if people needed and wanted it we accompanied and advocated for our clients as they interacted with the service system., Service Legacy Award Awarded the Service Legacy award in recognition of my work at DC Central Kitchen with the First Helping organization. It was awarded in part because of the lasting organizational changes I helped to implement in First Helping such as the implementation of a better office to field supply system. I also help create a dietary guidelines packet for our diabetic clients. Additionally, I also worked to better mesh First Helping's mission with that of other DC Central Kitchen organizations., Overnight Volunteer Calvary Women's shelter is a small 25 women's shelter. Volunteering there allowed me the opportunity to understand what parts of the homeless population experienced at night. My presence allowed the staff to have a break and not be there. I would arrive in the evening and stay until the morning. During the night I was there to note any unusual activity and to let in those women who had late arrival permission (for work etc.) Each morning I was responsible for preparing a small breakfast for the women. The experience provided me with some insight into what life was like in a transitional shelter., Summer Research Intern Dr. Jay Hove's lab at the Genome Research Institute conducts research using a zebrafish model. In his lab I started by working in the tank rooms. There I learnt how the system works, the parameters in place to prevent disease outbreaks, and how different strains were introduced. I was also responsible for starting an obesity research project. I worked to obtain permission for a lab expansion into another room and for animal research use. At the same time I also established zebrafish growth curves for different diets. The project centered on the idea that because zebrafish are cold blooded they keep warm through spontaneous muscle activity. Using a camera and software designed to track swim activity we identified those within the population who naturally swam more and those that naturally swam less. These two groups were to be bred out. Once bred out they would be subject to two different diets: one normal and one high fat. The hypothesis being that those genetically predisposed to swim more (more spontaneous muscle activity) would gain less weight on both diets. All fish were to be decapitated and their gene activity assessed. The hope being that those 'fast swimmers' would have different genes activated than their slower counterparts. Eventually the lab was to look for human analogs of these genes, Art Class Volunteer/Homework Helper Green Street Arts Center is an after school and community center with various art programming. I volunteered in a 3rd grade after school art class as a teacher's assistant. Additionally I also worked in the homework help room assisting those members of the art class as well as others with their schoolwork., High Hopes Volunteer High Hopes is a therapeutic riding center for mentally and physically handicapped individuals located in Old Lyme, CT. Each rider has a team of up to three volunteers. These volunteers are divided into two groups: those responsible for the horse and those responsible for the rider. I started as a horse leader, the volunteer responsible for making sure the horse was behaving properly. Later I became a sidewalker, the individual who walks beside the rider supporting them physically and providing a liaison between the rider and the instructor. I also spent part of my time in the barn preparing the horses for class. Eventually I began feeding the horses breakfast and bringing them into the barn from the pastures one morning a week. I worked with the same riders throughout my time as well as filling other volunteer gaps from time to time. Volunteering at High Hopes became therapeutic for me as well. Being able to leave campus twice a week and involve myself in a completely different community was personally beneficial. High Hopes showed me that behind the scenes work is just as important as  direct service work.,  Homeless Street Outreach, Movie Set Medic I spent a few weeks in the bayou of southern Louisiana being the on set medic for a small independent movie titled Beasts of the Southern Wild and produced by Court 13 productions. The work consisted of taking care of 80 - 90 actors and crew members as they made the movie. The injuries were mostly minor although there were the occasional burns and rusty nail punctures. I was there to make sure that those who needed more serious medical attention knew to get it. I also did some medical prop advising for some scenes set in a hospital., mothers2mothers Summer Intershinp mothers2mothers is an NGO based in Cape Town, South Africa that works to prevent the transmission of HIV between mother and child. It currently operates in South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, and Zambia. Part of the organizations core mission is to empower women to become educators within their own communities by training HIV+ mothers to then teach other HIV+ pregnant women. That summer I worked with another intern editing and reworking the large HIV/AIDS education and training manual. In the summer of 2007 mothers2mothers was not yet operating outside of South Africa and all of their training material was not geared towards any other country. To this effect we standardized all of the materials and made them country neutral. This involved spending time in various rural clinics working directing with the educators gathering their feedback. I also worked on switching all of the supervisors' company credit cards to smartchip technology. This was designed to cut back on credit card fraud as well as to improve payment efficiency., Front Desk/Needle Exchange The Washington Heights Corner Project (WHCP) is a needle exchange program in New York City's Washington Heights neighborhood. As a front desk volunteer I was responsible for exchanging needles with those who come to the WHCP. This involved logging the transactions, as New York State requires that the exchanges be recorded. Front desk volunteers are also responsible for keeping an eye on the general activity within the front of the office., Outreach Intern TierraDirect is a new Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) organization in New York City's Washington Heights neighborhood. Unlike other CSAs, TierraDirect's express goal is to involve as many low income individuals as possible. Generally CSAs tend to be supported by the middle and upper classes. This makes TierraDirect's commitment to have as many subsidized low income shares fairly unique. As the organization is still in its infancy all those involved are helping in anyway they can. For instance I helped to create and digitize the logo. As the organization grows and begins to recruit members this spring I will be involved with reaching out the community. Once the season gets underway I will be helping with cooking demonstrations and food distribution as well."

    "text": "You can tell a lot about someone based on their fans, or at least based on those of whom they are a fan. I am a fan of Rachel Green, a girl with whom I went to elementary school. I met her when we were in the fourth grade, just after she had joined Pep Club, an organization created by my mother for girls to get early experience with cheerleading. You wouldn't know that Rachel had cancer from how she acted, always having a smile on her face, especially during cheer practice. I attended the twice weekly practices as my mother's helper. She didn't always pick up the moves for the routine right away, but she was a hard worker, focused and determined. After a few weeks of practice, she had nailed the routine. We became good friends throughout the year and I was excited to finally see her perform at the last home basketball game of the year. After a night filled with a performance, basketball game and celebration, I asked Rachel what her favorite part had been and I still remember what she had said. The fans. Outside of her immediate family, I was her biggest fan. \tGrowing up, I had always thought that I'd someday have a job in mathematics or computer science. I knew, even as a six or seven year old child, that technology was the future of industry, research and medicine as well. Scientific innovation and medical technology have made tremendous progress over the past few years, whether it is genome mapping for genetic integration or nanotechnology to find new ways to treat, cure and even prevent diseases. However, this technology alone lacks something that medicine demands, a human element. I have tutored students in mathematics and chemistry, given countless tours to prospective high schoolers, filled hundreds of prescriptions and mentored children weekly and through it all, I have come to realize that a human touch is irreplaceable. Certain interaction plainly demands personal contact and even just a moment of interaction can touch a person's life.  \tRachel and our sixteen month friendship touched mine. She lost her battle with cancer in December of the next year. While the advancements in medicine at the time were not enough to save her life, a few volunteers like my mother and her Pep Club made hers a life worth living. Spending time with Rachel and others convinced me that I wanted to work directly with those like her, whose afflictions can not yet be cured or at least are difficult to treat.  \tI may have been Rachel's fan, but my biggest fan  is my little brother Logan. Since the year I started high school, my mom has been left alone to raise her four children and so I had to take on a more responsible, father-like role toward my younger brother. I chauffer him to baseball games, band performances and football practices. I have helped him practice and pass countless math and spelling tests as well. In my college years, I have not had as much time as I would have liked to perhaps take on a large research or volunteer opportunity, but I would not have wanted my relationship with my brother to be strained and any of his opportunities to suffer because of something I wanted to do. He looks up to me and I first found out just how much when I came home from college for Halloween weekend in 2008. He was dressed in a costume, wearing a stethoscope, my Delta Chi hat and an Ohio State tee shirt. He was me for Halloween. That night my mother told me that he had come up with that costume on his own and that he had also decided what he wanted to do when he grew up. He wanted to be a doctor too, just like me. He was and definitely still is my biggest fan and motivation.  \tI may have started with an interest in mathematics and technology, but Rachel's fight with cancer first showed me that medicine was the right place for me. It also constantly reminds me of all the future medical innovation that lies just on the horizon. It is this excitement that motivates me toward a future in healthcare. My experiences with my little brother also remind me daily of why I continue to stay focused; I have him looking up to me, further encouraging my diligence.  \tOne of my favorite quotes, since I first read it about three years ago, was spoken by Winston Churchill. Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. Though my path to medical practice has been and will continue to be a long and scenic one, I have no regrets. I press on.  I look forward to a pursuit of medical innovation, especially that involving cutting edge technology, but I will never forget that I first realized my passion for medicine not in a laboratory, computer class or clinic, but  because of my personal contact with Rachel Green. In my career as a medical doctor, I will work to serve my patients not simply as a bringer of healing, but also as a friend. I hope to support them in the toughest moments of their lives and also to guide them toward healthier lifestyles. Technological advances may aid me in my future endeavors, but a machine will never posses the human element that a compassionate physician can bring. I know deep down to the core that the field of medicine is where I belong. I believe  I can bring this essential human element of compassion to the medical world and make it a much better place.  Chemistry Teaching Assistant, Club Dodgeball Team Dodgeball is a club sport at The Ohio State University. The team travels to other universities for games throughout the midwest. The team plays games as part of the National College Dodgeball Association. The team promotes physical activity and fosters a competitive spirit for matches. I have also been on the team OSU has submitted for the national championship for the last three years in which we have come home with great finished of 2nd, 3rd and 3rd place trophies over the past 3 years. The Club Dodgeball team is also in charge of running the general Dodgeball Club, which promotes a less competitive environment for the general OSU student population to play dodgeball on campus. The club team also helps out with several greek organization's philanthropies on campus ao they can raise money for their various causes., Delta Chi Fraternity and Executive Board Founded as a law fraternity, Delta Chi has provided me with a lot of leadership opportunities for leadership even as a freshman at Ohio State. I joined Delta Chi in January of 2008 and by March, I was on the executive board for the entire chapter. I became the head of judicial affairs and risk management for the chapter. I had to assess risk and permission for various activities by the chapter. This past school year, I was on the 6 member executive board as the Alumni Secretary. I, along with the Ohio State Delta Chi Chapter, have also participated in several philanthropic efforts with the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research, Habitat for Humanity, The American Red Cross and the Franklin County Animal Shelter. In all I gained a lot of leadership and service opportunities through them., Giant Eagle Pharmacy Technician I assisted the pharmacist on duty with filling prescriptions, answering phone calls, contacting doctor's offices and contacting insurance companies as well. It was another aspect of the medical field that I have gotten to experience and learn about for an entire summer., Foreign Medical Ministry to Dominican Republic I had the opportunity to go on a 2 week medical aid trip to the Dominican Republic just before the start of my freshman year at Ohio State. For that 2 week period, I was assigned to be a doctors aid and stood at his side as he diagnosed the locals who did not have access to good medical care. It was a  very good experience and a wonderful chance to see a doctor in action before I started my college career., Intramural Sports I have participated in Intramural sports every quarter since my first quarter at Ohio State. My teams have been formed from work, room mates, exec boards, etc... I have played everything from volleyball, flag football, soccer, basketball, dodgeball and softball. My teams have won championships in dodgeball and basketball., Chemistry Teaching Assistant I taught several different general chemistry laboratory courses and tutored students weekly in the chemistry help room. I gained a lot of experience in leadership, teaching and patience. I had to be able to think on my toes and had to think to think of new ways to describe certain concepts since everyone has a different style of learning. Through this experience I think I have been better equipped to be a leader in the future., Bible Quizzing National Championships I was on religiously affiliated Bible quizzing team in the North Central Ohio District. I participated on the team for 4 years. Three of the years, my team won the national championship. Twice I was the captain of the team. Twice I was named in the Top 5 Quizzers of the Year and once I was the National Quizzer of the Year (2007).  I have helped coach the district quiz teams since 2007., Service Team Member for Off the Lake Off the Lake is primarily a service organization at Ohio State. The main service performed by the group are the theater productions every fall and spring. Admission for the audience is one canned good or one dollar. All money or food raised is donated to the Mid-Ohio Food Bank.  I also volunteered regularly with the group at the food bank, nursing homes, buckeyethon (a dance marathon at OSU to raise money for health research), and more. Off the Lake is also a musical theater organization. I get a great chance to perform and practice music and theater, two hobbies I love, with service. It is the perfect combination., American Red Cross Club Member The American Red Cross Club st Ohio State serves to provide volunteering opportunities and awareness for blood drives and other Red Cross efforts around central Ohio. The club has biweekly meetings and each member volunteers for an hour or two each week at a blood drive to help them reach their goal. We have guest speakers at most meetings to talk about various health awareness subjects such as hand washing, H1N1, Avian Flu, blood borne pathogens, etc... It has been a very rewarding experience to see a clinical/medical perspective from the view of the Red Cross for these past few years., Director of Buckeye Pride on The Sportmanship Council The Sportsmanship Council exists to maintain a positive atmosphere at the University when it comes to athletic events. A few years ago, several Ohio State athletics fans showed very poor sportsmanship to opposing teams and it persisted for some time. A few times, these OSU fans even rioted in the streets burning things and so on. The council was created in 2003 to help combat this negative attitude around sports. We want opposing students and fans to feel safe on our campus and we want to welcome them with open arms to our University. The council also exists to promote students spirit and attendance to non- revenue sports (under-represented sports such as women's soccer, track and field, field hockey, etc...) I am the director of this non-revenue spirit initiative on the executive board of the council.  I was also one of our council's representatives at the Big Ten Sportsmanship Conference, a meeting of all Big Ten Universities to exchange ideas, foster good relations between individuals and to plan for the future of sportsmanship and spirit in the conference. I am very grateful to have participated in this display of sportsmanship between members of the conference., University Ambassador at The Ohio State University University Ambassadors at The Ohio State University are those who give campus tours to prospective students as well as visiting dignitaries and younger children. This is traditionally a paid position, but since I was a chemistry TA at OSU, I was not able to be a paid TA and a paid Ambassador. I really did not want to give up being an ambassador, so I joined the team as a volunteer. Overall, I am very proud that I had been accepted as an ambassador in the first place, since only the most involved students and the students that are quickest to think on their feet join the team. Since I began there, I have had the privilege of sharing with over 700 visitors. I have a great love for this undergraduate university of mine and I love that I get the opportunity to share that with others. Also I love when I get to speak with the younger students, those who are not juniors or seniors in high school. We have many scheduled tours of those ages 10-16 often from urban backgrounds, so I got a lot of great opportunities to inspire younger students to set goals and perhaps go to college some day too. Overall, it is a very rewarding experience to be an Ambassador and will continue to do it as long as I can., College Mentors for Kids With College Mentors for Kids, I get the chance to hang out with kids every other week from the central Ohio area as a mentor. It is sort of like Big Brothers, Big Sister where the little sister/brother comes to you. It is a very rewarding experience and it makes it easy for other students to get involved. CMFK is actually expanding since so many college students want to get involved!"

    "text": "An HIV test takes about one minute once the blood sample has been dropped on the test strip.  In that time I noticed that the man in front of me was nervous.  He was not old, maybe thirty.  My time at the clinic taught me that the the skin lesions on his neck were signs of a weakened immune system.  The two lines on the small plastic tester confirmed my suspicions that the man was infected by HIV.  The clinic was crowded, and since the man spoke some English, it was my responsibility to explain his results to him.  I had witnessed patients receiving their positive results, but never had to give them myself. I felt unworthy to tell him his life changing results but did so with all the compassion and respect I had.  While my experience cannot be compared to his, telling him was one of the hardest things I have had to do in my life.  Some moments like this at the clinic were difficult, however they taught me about my own desire to go into medicine.  I am drawn to the complexity of human physiology, but I want to use my knowledge directly so that people's lives would be restored.  Medicine is important and I want to dedicate both my intellect and humanity to the noble profession of healing the sick.    The HIV testing was part of a five month service learning experience in Cape Town, South Africa.  I worked two days a week at the mobile HIV/TB clinic of the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation.  The mobile clinic was named The Tutu Tester by the communities it treated.   The neighborhoods we served were packed with one room, tin roofed houses and had only public latrines. The environment was informal; we were in tents, not hospitals. Despite the rugged environment, we were testing patients and giving evidence based counseling. I had several roles at the Tutu Tester.  I learned to administer the HIV, blood sugar, and blood pressure tests.  Eventually, I could see patients independently and go through the medical history form in the local language, Xhosa.  Some days I concentrated on the TB testing at the clinic.  When testing the patients for TB, I was in charge of administering the nebulized-saline induced sputum collection.  In addition I was running the first clinical trials of a foot-pump powered nebulizer for a professor at Marquette.    My time at the clinic gave me the experience to understand the serious choice of pursuing a career in medicine.  I had been considering a medical vocation since high school, but those full days at the clinic convinced me I wanted to spend a lifetime as a physician.  I became fascinated by the complexity of the issues facing medicine, from physiological problems to cultural issues.  For example, I wanted to better understand the mechanics of how the epidemic retrovirus affects the immune system but I also wanted to know why some cultural groups in South Africa have difficulty distinguishing HIV from witchcraft.  My experience at the Tutu Tester confirmed what has always attracted me to medicine.  I am drawn to the career because, as a physician I would have to navigate through complex systems to solve problems that impact the lives of real individuals.    The intellectual challenge inspires me.  The sciences have always been one of my passions and I am fascinated by the way in which biology, chemistry and physics interact within the human body.  The ideas presented in my physiology class would send my mind whirring with thoughts.  I relish learning the complexities that the medical community currently understands and energized by the idea that there is more to come.  I want to be a part of the future of this critical undertaking.    Intellectual investigation is not my only interest. As much as I want to learn about physiology and investigate new treatments, I would not be fulfilled if I could not connect with individual patients. Being able to interact with people awakens me and makes the day more full and satisfying.  In South Africa, I thrived in the rhythm of a day full of patients.  I love the opportunity to understand someone in a deeper, more personal way.  Not only do I feel more alive when I am able to build a relationship with someone, I have the empathy to connect with patients, even in their desperation.  I would try to recognize their possible fear or confusion, and help them to feel comfortable and understood.    Learning medicine is not a casual commitment.  I had days at the HIV clinic that were both long and discouraging and I realize that if I continue in the medical field, there is much more difficulty to come.  I have not chosen medicine naively.   Despite the difficulty of learning and practicing medicine, I will be sustained by the satisfaction of doing truly essential work.  Many people at the South African clinic or in my own community would not be alive without the care of a doctor.  Their lives are important and it is not lightly that I have chosen to dedicate myself to helping them. I have the skills, intellect, and compassion to be a good physician. There is something simple and beautiful in using one's skills to restore and to heal. Outstanding Engineering Sophomore Given to engineering sophomore's with a GPA above a 3.85.  I was given this award in my first year because I was a sophomore by credit hours., Resident Assistant I built a community of thirty freshman and enforced residence hall policy. I served as a para professional counselor for residents of the building. As part of a staff of other resident assistants I was able to both lead initiatives and support other leaders., Campus Ministry Leadership Team I have been involved in Christian ministry at Marquette since my freshman year.  As a Sophomore I was the MC of our weekly meeting.  Last spring I lead a group on a mission trip in Florida.  This year I am leading the weekly meeting team and am part of the leadership team., Lifeguard I have guarded a local pool during the summers.  There I enforce rules, watch for distressed swimmers, and did first aid on minor injuries.  I also taught swim lessons., Marquette College of Engineering Explorer Scholar I scored 2nd out of 250 prospective Marquette engineering students on a scholarship competition test., Eagle Scout I was involved as a Boy Scout for 7 years and achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.  I lead the troop in that time as assistant senior patrol leader, chaplain, and troop historian.  To achieve the rank of Eagle, I lead a project in which my troop collected over 1000 used children's books for an under resourced elementary school in downtown Cincinnati., Research Assistant at the Food and Drug Administration In a summer internship I designed, directed construction, and tested a phantom to test CT/Xray imaging.  The phantom was a small physical device that could be placed in front of a xray imager and could be used to assess the definition of the image rendered.  The researcher in charge of my project, Iacovos Kypriano, gave me the parameters of the phantom that he wanted.  I lead that part of the project, drew 3D computerized designs.  I worked with the FDA workshop to build the phantom and tested the phantom by taking images  and reconstructing the images to render a 3D figure.,  Lifeguard,  Resident Assistant, HIV/TB testing clinician Testing patients for HIV, TB, blood sugar, blood pressure, and syphilis at a mobile clinic.  As a tester I would also draw blood for a CD4 count and feel for inflamed lymph nodes of those who tested positive for HIV.  The TB testing consisted of taking a saline induced sputum sample from the patients., Human Powered Nebulizer clinical trial The human powered nebulizer is a mechanical nebulizer much like those found commonly at clinics and homes.  The main difference is that the pump piston is powered by human motion rather than an electric motor.  The development of this device began at Marquette University several years ago by Dr. Lars Olson.  The goal is to be able to bring nebulizer treatments to areas with poor access to electricity.  When I was working at the clinic in South Africa I administered the first clinical tests of the first prototype of the nebulizer.  Working with the device in the field revealed many of the devices shortcomings so my main purpose became fixing the device and working on design changes.  Many of the my have been implemented into the newest versions and the device is operating much more successfully."

    "text": "As I leapt from the ground, I felt the cool breeze and tasted the salty sea air. Landing, rather clumsily, I immediately regretted my decision to leap in the first place. This regret compounded when, the next night, my group transported me to an urgent care center for x-rays of my swollen foot. Every urgent care center we attempted to visit that night had been closed for weeks because of Hurricane Ike, the same hurricane that brought me to New Orleans. I finally had to go to a crowded Emergency Room for a diagnosis after hours of waiting. My long wait provided me with ample time to process this unfamiliar experience -- what it felt like to live in an underserved area and need medical attention.  My week in New Orleans enhanced my semester in Over-the-Rhine (OTR) with Xavier's Urban Academic Service Learning program. OTR is a Cincinnati neighborhood with a reputation as the most dangerous neighborhood in America and is home to a significant concentration of Cincinnati's poor. The Urban program was an integrative learning experience, which combined service with academic work. I immersed myself in the culture of OTR while learning about the complex issues that continue to affect urban neighborhoods in the United States. During my time there, I worked as a pediatric volunteer intern at Crossroad Health Center, a community clinic with a sliding fee for services based on family size and income.  Crossroad opened my eyes to underserved populations and inspired my desire to work as a primary care physician in an underserved area. I frequently checked in patients, including Spanish-speaking patients, and worked on ongoing projects with the MAs and nurse practitioners. During the semester, I assisted qualified patients in applying for Medicaid benefits and entered immunization records into an online system. I also had the opportunity to shadow physicians throughout my semester there; my shadowing experiences and the rest of my time at Crossroad opened up my eyes to issues within the health care system that I had never experienced beforehand. I witnessed the tension non-English-speaking patients can feel when working with a translator instead of speaking directly with their physician. I saw patients who waited for months before seeking medical care because they could not afford to pay their medical bills. I listened as parents told me that their families did not have access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods because they were too expensive. Throughout the semester, I learned about the complex issues that affect health and wellness, especially among poor and underserved populations.   My experience during the service-learning semester led me to pursue a research position with the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. I interned with the Department of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology in the INNOVATIONS Lab, where I worked on various research projects. My main project involved collaborating with the Cincinnati Pediatric Research Group to look at the effect of ADHD stimulant medication on growth in pediatric patients. The study is a retrospective clinical research study, relying solely on the audit of existing medical records in community-based pediatric practices. This project was designed to address the limitations regarding height delays in the extant literature. I am currently continuing with this research and working towards its eventual publication. I love my work with the ADHD study and plan to continue research as an integral part of my work as a physician. I am especially interested in research related to health disparities because of my work at Crossroad Health Center - health disparities is an important area of research because it will facilitate the reduction, and ultimate elimination, of such inequalities. As a physician, I will enhance my practice by working to understand the epidemiology of diseases and by developing diagnostics and preventive approaches to work towards health equity.  My experiences researching at Cincinnati Children's and working with Crossroad have deepened my desire to pursue a career as a physician. I am drawn to medicine because it incorporates scientific inquiry with a humanistic approach, and my firsthand experiences have helped me relate to the challenges underserved and forgotten populations must face as they navigate through the health care system. Furthermore, they motivate me to work to change the current system. My passion for working with underserved populations, and my skills, including my ability to speak Spanish, prepare me for my future career in medicine. As it turns out, my leap in New Orleans was the first step of my journey towards becoming a primary care physician in an underserved area with a focus on health disparities and public health research and initiatives. President & Co-Founder, Voices for Democracy As a result of wanting to take a more active role in the political process and have my voice be heard (our slogan), I co-founded Voices for Democacy during the spring of my sophomore year at Xavier University. I have since served as both the Vice President of the club and the President. As the VP, I served as the liaison between the club and the student body, SGA, and other Center for Faith and Justice programs and coordinated membership and educational events. As President, I organized letter writing campaigns on specific justice-related issues, such as immigration, mountain-top removal, and international aid for children in poverty, and created a how-to packet to encourage other students to write letters to their local, state, and national representatives. This year, Voices is assisting the State Department of Ohio in organizing voter registration campaigns on Xavier's campus that will serve as models for other university and high school campuses. Resulting from my participation in Voices for Democracy, I have learned the importance of remaining open to all sides of an issue, whether it is about politics, fundraising or another topic; this is especially key for a role model/leader., Xavier's University Scholars Honors Program As a student in the University Scholars program, I completed Xavier's core curriculum at the honors-level by taking special scholars sections in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences, while also completing the requirements for my major. This intensified course of study promoted lively class discussions and a deeper study of specialized topics. These honors-level courses force me to think deeper and probe the subject matter more fully. Additionally, I have truly grown and challenged myself through demanding core courses that challenge what I know and believe to be true. These courses push me to acknowledge my biases and stereotypes and to be critical of all I encounter. These scholars-level courses have greatly changed my thoughts and way of being., Summer Camp Counselor For 5 summers, I worked as a mad scientist at Mad Science, an international company that delivers unique hands-on science enrichment experiences for children. Mad Science is recognized as the world's leading science enrichment provider, with both domestic and international franchises. In working towards Mad Science's mission to spark imaginative learning, I served mainly as a camp counselor, but I also presented special events, including school assemblies and birthday parties. I worked to energize and educate children about science. As an experienced mad scientist, I also helped with on-the-job training of assistants and other camp counselors and led my own camps of 10-25 campers each week. Mad Science offers weeklong day camps, with daily themes such as Junior Engineers and the Organ Trail. Not only did I discover how to be a great leader in a classroom setting, I also learned how to interact with concerned parents, obnoxious children, and scientific failures. I became aware of a great talent within myself for working with children by explaining complicated experiments and scientific concepts to them and keeping their attention for longer than their age. Mad Science provided an opportunity for me to excite children about something that I am passionate about - science and scientific investigation., (Senior) Resident Assistant I am a Resident Assistant (RA) in the all-first year residence hall on Xavier's campus. I am responsible for helping to create a community with a wing of 28 women; I work toward fostering personal relationships with each resident by planning educational and social programs that focus on departmental themes. I also serve as a mediator and peer mentor to my residents. I counsel and refer students with academic, personal, and social matters to appropriate on-campus resources. Additionally, I help students to develop standards for behavior necessary for maintaining a safe and secure community by enforcing Xavier University policy and serving on an on-call duty rotation. I am also the Senior Resident Assistant (SRA) in my building. The SRA position serves as a liaison between their fellow staff members and the Hall Director (HD) and assists with the supervision of the resident assistant staff. As the SRA, I manage a budget of over $3,000 and track the programs of each of the 12 RAs on my staff. I also coordinate with the HD on projects and special initiatives within the building. As an RA and SRA, I have learned how to better balance my time, interact with a diverse group of people and respond in a crisis., Dean's List I earned and maintained a grade point average of at least a 3.5 for each of the past six semesters, and was, therefore, named to the Dean's List for the College of Arts and Sciences each semester., Shadowing I have had the opportunity to shadow various physicians and other health care professionals for the past 5 years. I have learned what medical specializations I would not like to practice. In high school, I participated in a shadowing program for seniors interested in health professions and was able to shadow a hospital pharmacist for a day. I went on rounds and sat in on meetings with providers in the ICU. I also shadowed an emergency room physician while volunteering in the ER, on one of the less-urgent wings. Emergency medicine and pharmacy are not the jobs for me; however, I greatly enjoyed the time I spent shadowing the physicians at Crossroad Health Center and Drs. Bill Brinkman and Joel Singerman this summer. While shadowing at Crossroad, I learned about the complex issues that affect health and wellness, especially among poor and underserved populations. I also shadowed Dr. Joel Singerman, a community pediatrician, in his practice -- Springdale Mason Pediatrics and Dr. Bill Brinkman, a physician in General Pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's, in the CCHMC ADHD Clinic and the PPC. I especially enjoyed shadowing Dr. Brinkman at the PPC because the PPC focuses on the primary care of underserved populations in a hospital. I am especially interested in pediatric medicine, as inspired by shadowing., ConneXions Student Co-Chair I lead the ConneXions program, which is part of Xavier's Center for Faith & Justice. ConneXions is a service program, primarily for first-year students, that offers a chance to volunteer at different non-profit agencies. Its mission is to encourage new friendships, stimulate reflection, and explore Cincinnati through service. As a leader, I facilitate weekly outings and reflections for a group of 8-12 participants. I also serve as the student co-chair of ConneXions. My role includes contacting agencies and community partners to schedule service outings, planning large group reflections, and coordinating bi-weekly leader meetings., Emergency Room Volunteer I served as a volunteer at the front desk of the Emergency Room at Robinson Memorial Hospital, a hospital in Ravenna, Ohio. I assisted patients in checking into the ER and brought them back to their rooms after they were triaged. I also made sure that patients waiting in the Emergency Room were comfortable by bringing them snacks, drinks, and blankets when appropriate. Since I volunteered at the front desk, I also answered (and transferred) phone calls to the ER, guided patients and visitors to their rooms and to places throughout the hospital, and transferred patients to other areas of the hospital. At Robinson, I saw, firsthand, one of the harsh realities of the health care system -- patients would go to the ER for a cold because they did not have health insurance or a primary care physician. These same patients would wait for hours to see a physician, which often prolonged the wait for patients who needed emergency care. I also learned that I am not interested in becoming an emergency physician; rather, I want to work in primary care., Same Day Surgery Playroom Volunteer I volunteered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital in the Same Day Surgery Playroom. While there, I organized and disinfected toys, talked with patients and brought them said toys to their pre-op rooms. I also organized games and activities for the main playroom where the patients and their siblings waited until a room was available in the back. At the hospital, I also had the opportunity to interact with children from all over the world who needed surgery. One of the patients had been in and out of Children's for 8 years -- the entire Same Day Surgery staff knew him and his story. He was from Nigeria and had traveled thousands of miles for various surgeries. The staff at Children's made him light up and seem to come alive, and his parents were so grateful for the care their son was able to receive. These patients pulled on my heartstrings, so to speak, and inspire me that much more to become a physician., Alpha Epsilon Delta Pre-Professional Health Honor Society My participation in AED Pre-Professional Health Honor Society provides an opportunity to network with other students interested in health care and with local physicians and health professionals to explore health care opportunities. I was nominated for AED because of my achievements in the classroom and my extracurricular participation. I attend monthly meetings, participate in fundraising activities for health-related charities, complete service hours, and learn more about the health profession through speakers and presentations.,  Senior Resident Assistant,  Summer Camp Counselor, Dean's Advisory Council of Students The chair of the Modern Language Department nominated me to be the department's representative on the Dean's Advisory Council of Students. The Advisory Council meets at least two times a semester to discuss current hot topics on campus with the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. We discuss issues such as the ongoing campus expansion and academic advising. I offer insight into the experiences of a Modern Language student., Gold X-Key Leadership Award The Gold X-Key Award for Leadership is a prestigious recognition awarded by Xavier's Office of Student Involvement. Recipients must be nominated by a staff-member of the office and then go through an application process. I received the award for my involvement in Residence Life, ConneXions, the Dean's Advisory Council of Students, and other extracurricular activities and for my ability to encourage and empower others to become leaders. Additional requirements for the award are working toward self-improvement and a balanced lifestyle., Savage Memorial Scholar The Savage Scholarship is a competitive scholarship awarded to two Xavier upperclassmen. Each academic department chair nominates one student in recognition of dedication and excellence in the humanities. Applicants are then evaluated on their willingness to take intellectually more-challenging courses in the humanities and their concern to relate their respective fields of study towards the clarification of human values in the contemporary world. I received this esteemed award for my junior year after having been nominated by the Modern Language department. The Savage Scholarship is considered one of the most prestigious and coveted academic awards on Xavier's campus., Volunteer Intern - Academic Service Learning Program The Urban Academic Service Learning Semester was an integrative learning experience combining service work and academic classes. As part of the semester, I lived in a low-income apartment in the heart of Over-the-Rhine, Cincinnati. I received a stipend for food and public transportation that was comparable to an income below poverty level. My classes, as part of the program, focused on community; African American history; and contemporary ethical issues such as poverty, immigration, capital punishment, and access to health care among many other topics. I also interned with Crossroad Health Center, a community clinic with a sliding fee for services. I logged more than 200 hours volunteering at Crossroad that semester. While there, my role varied daily. I often checked in patients -- taking their weight, height and oral medical history as well as checking their vision and hearing. I also participated in ongoing projects with the staff. For one such project, I called parents of pediatric patients to collect information on what motivated them to follow up on medical referrals. My experiences living in Over-the-Rhine and my time at Crossroad have inspired my desire to work as a primary care physician in an underserved area., Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow This summer, I interned with the SURF program at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in the INNOVATIONS Lab. I worked on various public health projects at different stages of their execution, including data collection, data entry, transcription and data integration. My main research collaborated with the Cincinnati Pediatric Research Group to look at the effect of ADHD stimulant medication on growth in pediatric patients. My role was to audit medical charts for this retrospective study. I am continuing to help with this research and working towards its eventual publication.  I also had the opportunity to shadow the two principal investigators of the ADHD growth pilot. I shadowed in a community-based pediatric practice, at the CCHMC ADHD Clinic and in the Pediatric Primary Care Clinic (PPC) at Children's. I especially enjoyed shadowing at the PPC because it serves as a clinic for underserved populations within a hospital setting. My shadowing experiences, research, and participation in the SURF program this summer have helped to solidify my career goals. They inspire me to want to earn a Master's in Public Health, with a concentration in epidemiology or health disparities, so that I have a stronger foundation to research disparities and advocate for community health projects as a physician."

    "text": "Enjoying the reprieve from the Greek sun under the shade of a pine tree at Epidaurus, I explained to my fellow study abroad classmates how we were at the most important site of ancient medicine. People from all over the world would flock to Epidaurus to pray to Asclepius, the god of healing, in the hopes of being cured by his priest-physicians.  Asclepius was a man who was not only praised, but deified, because he was able to raise the dead. Explaining this at the sanctuary dedicated to the mythological healer, I could not help but think back to my experience of shadowing a modern day healer through the University of Cincinnati's ROSE Program, who was powerless in the face of death.  \t I had shadowed a couple of different doctors in the hospital setting and was confident that I had the rounding process down: you go in, someone on the team presents on the patient, the attending asks some questions, the team goes over a plan of action, and you leave. The whole process takes just a few minutes. So I was surprised when the physician I was following walked into the patient's room, pulled up a chair, and sat down next to the emaciated female head peeking above the mound of white hospital blankets. I watched as the doctor took his patient's frail, bony hand and talked with her about the recent bad news concerning her treatment. Ms. A had terminal colon cancer which had spread throughout her body. Her oncologist had decided to withdrawal treatment and had requested that the Palliative Care team have an end of life discussion with her. I observed this discussion in which the two of them talked for over an hour about life, death, and the limits of modern medicine. The physician was humble; he did not pretend to have any answers for Ms. A as to why this was happening to her as a good Christian woman or how she and her family should proceed. Grief was visible on his face even in the dark room as she explained that she was scared, utterly scared of death. This woman was going to die, and soon, and there was nothing he could do but hold her hand and talk with her as she attempted to figure out what that meant.   Observing this conversation was the single most powerful experience of my young life and it showed me what type of physician I want to be. I don't mean a Palliative Care physician, per se, but a physician with empathy; one who puts as much emphasis on conversing with her patients as she does using the latest treatments. This type of physician sees herself in her patients' struggles and uses those to make herself better in the future. This experience made me realize that the human experience has been driving me towards becoming a physician all along.  It is human interaction that motivates me. As an Honors Bachelor of Arts major at Xavier University, I am part of a program that preserves the traditional Jesuit curriculum of Latin, Greek, and Philosophy. This rigorous honors program has engrained in me a spirit of hard work, determination, and most importantly a feeling of interconnectedness with people of all backgrounds. I have been told that I can hold a conversation with anyone, and through my classical education, I have engaged in conversations with not only my classmates and professors, but also Homer, Vergil, Euripides, Plato and Aristotle.  Through the works of these ancient authors, I have observed the commonalities of human life and emotion. It seems that across time and space we are all trying to explain the human experience in whatever language we know.   As part of my Jesuit education, I have developed a desire to become a woman for others. As a freshman at Xavier I got involved in a weekly service group called Connexions, where we did everything from raking leaves to doing arts and crafts with the elderly. Doing a variety of service around Cincinnati with other students, I was able to connect with them and with those we served. I had such a positive experience with Connexions that I felt called to become a leader with this group in order to give incoming freshmen a similar, positive experience. This group helps freshmen get to know their new city while improving that city through service. My call to leadership and the Jesuit values of scholarship and service have carried over into my other extracurriculars. I serve as the chapter secretary of Eta Sigma Phi, the national classics honors society. This society provides opportunities for scholarship and fellowship in the classics, and allowed me to present a paper at a national undergraduate conference. I will continue to share these Jesuit values as the incoming president of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honors society.    My Jesuit education taught me the importance of a continual cycle of experience and reflection for personal betterment.  So as I was reflecting on that modern conversation in the most important site for healing in the ancient world, I couldn't help but see how my experiences have influenced the way I view the world and the way I relate to others. My education has shown me what kind of physician I want to be, one who can heal with empathy while continuing to improve myself through my interactions with others.  That is why I wish to become an advocate, a woman for others, by gaining new experiences at a premier medical school. Connexions Connexions is a weekly service group for first year students at Xavier University in which students to service work in different neighborhoods of Cincinnati.  It was created as a way for students to learn about the city as well as the different social justice issues in it. I participated as a freshman and then became involved as a leader due to the positive experience I had participating. This will be my third year (5th semester) of leading a group., Zeta Chi Chapter of Eta Sigma Phi I am the secretary of the Zeta Chi chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, the national classics honors society. As secretary of the chapter, I am responsible for keeping the club organized by keeping meeting minutes and updated rosters. I also aid in the organization of activities including movie nights, holiday parties, trips, and induction ceremonies., Miami University Undergraduate Classics Conference I presented an original paper entitled Stockholm Syndrome in Livy's Sabine Women on March 16, 2012 at this national undergraduate classics conference. Twenty undergraduate students from around the country presented their work and received feedback from Miami University Classics professors., Summer Intern at Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment I was a summer intern at Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment (TERA), a non-profit organization whose mission is to protect public health. As a summer intern, I had both administrative and science based duties, including preliminary paper writing.  I co-authored two manuscripts, one comparing different models of peer review and a chapter for a major Toxicology reference book; both are currently being reviewed for publishing. This was my first experience with research and increased my ability to read and understand scientific articles., Best Organic Chemistry Student Award I was awarded the Best Organic Chemistry Student Award in August 2012 by the Chair of the Chemistry Department for being the top student in Organic Chemistry during the 2010-2011 academic year., Chemical Rubber Company Outstanding Freshman Chemistry Award I was awarded the Chemical Rubber Company Outstanding Freshman Chemistry Award in August 2010 by the Chemistry Department Chair for being the top freshman General Chemistry student in the 2009-2010 academic year., Joseph A. Verkamp Greek Award I was given the Joseph A. Verkamp Greek Award in April 2012 by the Chair of the Classics Department for excellence in the study of Greek., Tutoring I was hired as a tutoring in May 2012 for Xavier University's Learning Assistance Center.  I am certified to tutor General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biology, Latin and Greek.  I began tutoring Organic Chemistry and General Chemistry in Summer 2012 and will continue to tutor during the 2012-2013 school year., Ohio Kappa Chapter of Alpha Epsilon Delta I was inducted into the Ohio Kappa chapter of Alpha Epsilon Delta, the Health Preprofessional Honors Society in April of 2011.  As part of Xavier University's chapter, I have participated in various lectures, meetings, service projects, and induction ceremony. In the upcoming year, I will serve as the banquet coordinator, and will plan and host our induction ceremony in the spring., Xavier University Chapter of Alpha Sigma Nu I was inducted into the Xavier University chapter of Alpha Sigma Nu in April of 2012. In May of 2012, I was voted the chapter president for the upcoming 2012-2013 school year. Alpha Sigma Nu is the Jesuit honors society, which has a chapter at each of the 28 Jesuit universities in the United States. The three main elements of Alpha Sigma Nu are scholarship, loyalty to the ideals of Jesuit education, and service to others., Dean's Advisory Council of Students I was selected by the head of the classics department to participate in the student advisory council for the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.  I met twice a semester with the dean, associate dean, and fellow students to discuss different issues pertinent to our college and the campus as a whole.  In this way, the dean was able to represent her students better at meetings with the other deans and university president., Server at the Cintas Center's Joseph Club I work as a server during Xavier University men's basketball games in the Joseph Club. I provide customer service to Xavier basketball fans by serving food and drinks and maintaining a clean and organized club room.  This is seasonal work, as I work during men's home basketball games., Xavier University Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa In April 2012, I was inducted into Xavier University's Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.  Phi Beta Kappa is the United States' oldest academic honors society and was founded in 1776. This society focuses on excellent in the liberal arts and sciences., Washington United Homework Club Volunteer STAR (Students Taking Active Roles) is a weekly service group at Xavier University.  As part of this group, I volunteered at Washington United Homework Club, an after school program for students in Cincinnati Public Schools. I tutored young children between first and fifth grade in various subjects and played educational games with them in order to foster a greater appreciation for learning., ROSE Program The University of Cincinnati's ROSE Program is a combination two summer research internship and early medical school acceptance program. As part of the Family and Community Medicine Department Research Division, I worked 35 hours a week on clinical and translational research.  This included both quantitative and qualitative research under the tutelage of Dr. Saundra Regan and Dr. Christopher White."

    "text": "I will be a cancer survivor. I suppose I can't know that for sure, but if I don't believe that, how else will I have the strength to fight It was the morning of April 18th when I recieved a phone call from my Mom. Her voice shook as she told me the result of my biopsy; I had breast cancer. With my MCAT only a week and a half away, I had more than enough stress to deal with without that phone call. I fell apart.  Looking back I remember my first concern: the shame of being bald for my medical school interviews! This was a valid concern, but it shouldn't have been my first. After that moment, I realized I must change my perspective on priorities. I worried about school, grades, research, my MCAT...but these were not the most important things in my life at the time. The most important thing at that moment in my life was...my life. The thought of death at the hand of cancer changed how I saw myself.  Over the next week, I withdrew from classes, with each professor kind enough to give me an incomplete on my grades for that term, until I could finish the work. I had a much more difficult conversation with my commander of ROTC. He told me cancer is a disqualifier for the Air Force...I was losing my dream! Ever since early high school, I had wanted to be a surgeon for the Air Force, serving those who protect our country, and at first it seemed all was lost.  When I was young, living in New England, our family doctor was Dana Wiseman. He was a role model to me, and I enjoyed every visit. He made caring for our bodies a personal business; he cared about our lives as well as our health, and it showed in the way he ran his practice. I wanted to be just like him.  One cold winter, in a train station in Boston, during a snow storm, I came across a homeless man shivering and trying to sleep. I could do nothing for him; helpless I started crying. In the weeks that followed, I started a coat and blanket drive in my middle school for the homeless. I drove around downtown with a jug of hot chocolate, handing out what I had collected, but I never found that young man who stirred my heart.  When we moved, we made a final visit to Dr. Wiseman's office to pick up our records for a new doctor. We were there after hours, sitting in his waiting room, just talking. I still have not found another doctor as personal as he was. Upon leaving, he gave me his stethoscope. He knew I wanted to be like him, and told me to follow my dream. I still have it, and put it on every time I need encouragement.  I have only barely begun my journey through the fight against cancer, but I have found hope and more passion for fulfilling my dream. My commander called back the next day, and told me he had contacted the Surgeon General and aquired a six-month sick-leave from training. I still don't have the words to describe how thankful I was to have a second chance, to have my dream back! I know my commander was not required to do what he did. He had gone to the head of all medical decisions in the military, and convinced him to make an exception, for me! It was empowering to know how much he valued me, to see he had gone out of his way to change the rule: for me. It was a beautiful thing to see such great things come from tragedy.  In the first few weeks dealing with cancer, my first reaction was to make sure those around me, especially those in my family, were handling it well. No one understood why I cared so much for others at such a difficult time, but I did. It is who I am, and who I was when I cried for the cold man in Boston. I feel called to heal broken bodies and broken hearts. Medicine to me has never been simply to cure an illness or mend a wound; Dr. Wiseman taught me that medicine is to heal a person and touch a life, and I have learned through my recent experience as a patient how it feels to be on the other side.  My experiences have only enhanced my desire to become a doctor. They have shown me that the best doctor is not always the one who knows the most about the human body, but who also knows about the human heart. I know now that when I go through medical school, and go on to fulfill my dream of becoming an Air Force surgeon, I will treat every patient for their illness and their sorrows, and show each of them I care for more than their body: I care for them.  I have learned a lot of life lessons in these short few weeks I've battled cancer. Some things in life are far more important than they appear. True friends are there for you, even when you can no longer be there for them. Hard work can end up harder than anticipated, but passion can drive a person through any obstacle. Patients are more than their bodies, and caring for just the body of an individual often is not enough; you must care for the person.  Tragedy has a strange way of teaching lessons, or re-teaching some you learned as a child. It is not something I would choose for myself, by any means, but it will make me a stronger person, a better student, and a more compassionate doctor. Some may pity me in my uncommon situation of being diagnosed so early in life, but I now consider it a blessing. I have gained wisdom and experience I would not otherwise have had, and although it will be difficult, I know I will make it through a survivor.  Biochemical Research, Calamityville Training Senarios Calamityville is a piece of property owned by the Air Force base, which used to be a factory but is now abandoned and empty. The medical personel use the area to practice mass casualty events. I was a victim for two of the senarios they performed on this site. They had moulage artists decide what was wrong with each of us, and do our make-up with fake blood to make us appear injured. The victims were then scattered throughout the building, and the rescue teams had to find us, and treat us, before life flighting the group of us out by helicopter., Patterson Junior Chemistry Award Each year the Dayton Chapter of the American Chemical Society gives out the Patterson Junior Chemistry Award to one student from each of its participating Universities. The award is given to a junior in the chemistry program of each school and the recipient is chosen by the chemistry department of each respective school. This year I was honored to represent Wright State University at the local ACS meeting to recieve this prestigious award., Golden Key Honor Society Golden Key Honor Society is a service oriented honor society. I was inducted on October 25 2009., Emergency Room Volunteer I began my work in the emergency room at the beginning of April, planning to work until graduation. Unfortunately, since I was diagnosed with breast cancer less than three weeks later, I had to cut this experience short. I only worked for 3 weeks, but I did still gain some valuable experience.  I got to see how nurses and doctors interact. I saw the process of bringing patients in from the ambulances, triage from the waiting area, and patient care. I saw the inner workings of an ER that a patient never sees, and although it was short, I value my experience., Organic Chemistry Research I have spent two years so far working on two projects in organic chemistry research. The chemistry involved includes synthesis, various purification methods, and polymerizations.  I was introduced to a varity of instruments during my work in this lab. I have experience with Gas Chromotography Mass Spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Gel Permeation Chromatography, Infrared Spectroscopy, and I expect to be introduced to more instruments before I graduate.  While working with this group I also had the oppurtunity to work on public speaking. Each week during our meetings, we would present our most recent work to the group, and get feedback from the professor., SCUBA diving I took a scuba diving class during the fall quarter of my sophomore class. I went diving with the instructor the next summer, to refresh my skills before I did my certification dives in November of last year. I am now a certified diver.  Amber Bloom has invited me to join her on any of her future dives with new groups of students, which will give me a chance to practice my skill, every once in a while, even with a busy schedule., JROTC chaperone/mentor I visited Knox County Career Center, and spoke to the students involved in the JROTC program about my college ROTC experiences, and encouraged them to follow their dreams, and pushed themselves to exceed. I helped with their inspections that day as well.  I later chaperoned the group on a base visit, and a trip to the Air Force museum. I also helped coach their drill team before a competition, and chaperoned their trip to the competition. It was fun for me to pass on what I've learned from experience to those who may follow in my footsteps., Ballroom Dancing I was introduced to this dance group while living in my freshman dorms. One of the experienced dancers visited the dorm and taught us to waltz then invited us to join the class on Friday nights at a studio about 20 minutes from school. I had always been interested in dance growing up, but never had the oppurtunity to learn from professionals.   The group does not behave like a class, but more like a social event, which makes a lot of sense for a ballroom dance class. Throughout history, ballroom dancing has been common knowledge and used at social events. Now fewer people practice the art, but it is a treasured piece of our past I am glad to share with friends., Lifeguarding I worked two summers at the Hiawatha pool (including the summer I attended military training) and I would have worked this summer as well had it not been for my cancer, and the classes I had to make up.  I was on the swim team for many years as a child, so my backround and interests fit very well with a lifeguarding position. I enjoyed working with the children and teaching them pool safety, especially when I got to teach swim lessons last year in early July. I remember a young boy who hit his head last summer on the diving blocks. I was off duty at the time, but I was the only one who saw it. I helped him out of the water, then we found his mother. He didn't seem as scared with me there., ROTC awards Just to clarify, this is a list of awards I've earned throughout my ROTC career, so the award date is a bit deceptive as it is only the most recent date I have earned an award.  I have been privledge to earn several awards, while participating in the program throughout college. Below is a list: AFROTC 3-year scholarship June 2008 American Legion Scholastic Excellence Award Apr 2009 & Apr 2011 Reserve Officers Association Award Apr 2009 Daughters of American Founders and Patriots Award Apr 2010 Veterans of Foreign Wars Award Apr 2010 Achievement Award Apr 2010 and Feb 2011 Cadet of the Month Apr 2010 Field Training Graduate Aug 2010 Dr. Elenore A. Cook Scholastic Award Apr 2011,  officer trainee, Air Force ROTC training ROTC training includes 2 sessions of physical training per week and training in military history and leadership.  ROTC is a cadet run program in which the upperclassmen are responsible for training the underclassmen, thereby learning how to lead in the first two years, and applying it in the last two. I have gained experience in leadership both of small groups and large. I have vastly improved my public speaking skills.   I have participated and advised our drill team associated with ROTC, which teaches cadets leadership, discipline and respect.  I have also attended field training at Maxwell AFB and Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Camp in Alabama and Mississippi for 4 weeks., Chemistry Club The chemistry club was a small group, but it was a great place to network. I got to know some of the graduate students and upperclassmen early on in college, and I recieved a lot of valuable information from them about future classes and proffessors. I served as Treasurer during my Sophomore year, and helped plan a lot of our activities.  We regularly volunteer at the local science museum for chemistry events they schedule. We are also involved in campus wide events, to make our presence known and demonstate the fun side of chemistry. One year, we made ice cream at a college fair using lyquid nitrogen, and the next year we made tie-dye available., Alpha Lambda Delta Honor Society This is an honor society intended for freshmen. I was inducted on February 3 2009., Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society This is the honor society associated with the honors program. I was inducted on November 4 2010."

    "text": "My life has been blessed with opportunity, support and serendipity. Sports, community service, academics and scientific research have all been instrumental in shaping my values and strengths. While serendipity played a role in shaping how my life's experiences led me to select a career in medicine, selecting medicine embodies the values that I have developed and held throughout my life. I have always striven to be empathetic, compassionate and honest, and I am dedicated to approaching each day with bimod-meod - meaning my very veryness. This concept, which comes from the Torah, reminds me to use all of my belief, all of my strength and all of my essence in everything that I do.  My 16 years as a gymnast and 12 as a girl scout had the most impact in shaping what I like to call my key good doctor qualities: long-term commitment and universal compassion. A truly unique aspect of my involvement in these activities was the opportunity I had for self-discovery beyond the social pressure to fit in. I learned that I thrive when working towards a challenging goal, and that I have an enormous capacity to care about other people. Ultimately, my dedicated participation in these activities gave me national recognition through medals in Junior Olympic gymnastic competitions and the Gold Award, Girl Scouts' highest honor, awarded to only 5.4% of all eligible senior girl scouts.  For my Gold Award Project, I drew upon my interests in health and gymnastics to create a summer camp for children at the Family Recovery Center in Oceanside, California. This facility houses women and their children who are recovering from alcohol and drug abuse. I ran the camp with praise, positive rewards and optimism, adapting my program to meet the children's diverse individual needs and abilities. The sense of accomplishment I saw in the children's smiles told me that the camp was a success. It was humbling and rewarding to know that I had connected with the children one-on-one, and gained their trust and respect. I hope to draw upon my ability to convey compassion and foster therapeutic relationships in the practice of medicine.  I was involved in gymnastics between the ages of 4 and 21. During this time, I was an active competitor, Captain of the Torrey Pines High School team, an officer and competitor on the UC Davis club team, and a coach for the Ecke YMCA. I excelled in this challenging sport by fully committing myself to the hard work and dedication it takes to compete at the Junior Olympic levels, knowing I would progress in proportion to my effort. My gymnastics experiences taught me the value of persistence, resilience and the power of positive thinking, especially during frustrating and stressful situations. Most importantly, being a gymnast laid the foundation of my dedication to excellence that has carried over into my academics and has become an integral part of who I am.   Pushing my body to extremes of flexibility and strength as a gymnast also sparked an intellectual curiosity about the human body that led me years later to Exercise Biology classes at UC Davis. In these classes, I learned how molecular biology, chemistry, and physics affect our bodies in the real world application of exercise. In an attempt to learn more about exercise biology, I sought the advice of my professor Dr. James Shaffrath as to how I could become involved in the research he presented in class. A week later I joined the Functional Molecular Biology Laboratory as a volunteer research assistant to Dr. Keith Baar, a professor and principle investigator at UC Davis, and my current mentor. Following my graduation, I was hired as a junior specialist and led an investigation into the interaction of the protein, Notch and the growth regulator mTORC1 in the control of muscle size. Working with Dr. Baar has been an invaluable experience; I have become proficient at numerous techniques including molecular cloning and western blotting, I have learned how to read and analyze scientific literature, and I have had the opportunity to work collaboratively on one paper published in PLoS ONE and on three other manuscripts that are in preparation to be submitted for publication.  My involvement in scientific research began as a means to explore an academic interest, but serendipitously turned out to be the final catalyst in my decision to pursue a medical career; to combine my passion for science with the clinical aspects of direct patient interaction. Research satisfies my intellectual curiosity, my need to learn, discover, share and apply. Medicine is always evolving, and this evolution relies on the intimate relationship between physicians and researchers. I look forward to better understanding and possibly contributing to this continued evolution.  My life path has been filled with twists and turns. Sixteen years ago, I could never have predicted where these interests-lessons from the Torah, my pursuit of physical and academic excellence, my love of science, and my commitment to serving others-would lead me. My experiences from each step along the way have now coalesced these interests into a clear vision of what I wish for my future. The medical field is a challenging, stimulating, and rewarding profession to which I can fully commit my heart and mind Research Assistant/Junior Specialist Coordinate and organize the general day-to-day activities within the laboratory. I presently lead  our labs investigations into the interaction of the protein Notch with the central growth regulator mTORC1 on the control of muscle size. These experiments use molecular cloning, sub-cloning, and site directed mutagenesis to modify notch and determine the effect on mTORC1 using cell culture, sub-cellular fractionation, and western blotting. I am currently a salaried employee of the lab, and have accepted an offer to continue my employment in the Functional Molecular Biology lab through the academic year of 2011-2012., Tutoring my sorority sisters During my junior and senior years of college I was often approached by other girls in my sorority for help with their upper and lower division science classes. I did not receive payment or course credits for the time that I spent tutoring my peers. Although I often did not have the time to spare from my own studies, I knew I could help, and that often the path to understanding difficult concepts was simply the method of explanation. Because I knew my sorority sisters well, I was able to adapt to their learning styles to explain concepts in ways I knew they would understand. This experience was meaningful as helped me refine my own time management skills and was personally very rewarding., National Pan-Hellenic Academic Achievement Award For maintaining a GPA above 3.5 while an active member of a sorority, I was honored in 2008, 2009 and 2010 by the National Pan-Hellenic Conference for academic excellence., Gymnastics; Competitor, Coach I began gymnastics at the age of four and by the age of ten I was practicing 20-25 hours a week year-round as part of the competitive team. For the next seven years I competed throughout the Western United States as a Level 5, 6, 7 and 8 Junior Olympic gymnast. During this time I also competed for and was captain of my Varsity High School gymnastics team, as well as a gymnastics coach at the Ecke YMCA gymnastics facility. While I attended UC Davis I was both an officer and competitive athlete for the club gymnastics team., Medical Mission- Healing Hearts Across Borders I participated in a three day medical missionary trip through the Healing Hearts Across Borders Organization to Tijuana, Mexico. This organization sets up a free clinic, several time a year, to provide basic medical/dental care, as well as food and clothing to two of the poorest villages in Tijuana. My responsibilities on this mission included helping to set up and take down the clinics each day as well as to act as a scribe for Dr. Bruce Zuraw. I  accompanied Dr. Zuraw as he saw patients and would update the patient history and charts, and write any new medications and lab tests the doctor prescribed., Girl Scouts' Gold Award I started as a Daisy Girl Scout at age 5 in 1993 and completed my Gold Award as a Senior Girl Scout in 2005. For my Gold Award Project I created, organized, staffed and led a week-long Gymnastics and Nutrition Day Camp for children at the Family Recovery Center, a residential facility for indigent mothers (and their school age children) who were in recovery for alcohol and substance abuse. This coordinated project, which I was solely responsible for, took nearly a year for the planning, approval and implementation process., Publication, PLoS ONE Journal I was a contributor and collaborator in the publication of ER STRESS INDUCES ANABOLIC RESISTANCE IN MUSCLE CELLS THROUGH PKB-INDUCED BLOCKADE OF  mTORC1. Louise Deldicque, Luc Bertrand, Amy Patton, Marc Francaux and Keith Baar, PLoS One, 2011, June (estimated date of pub) [Epub ahead of print]. I have also contributed to three additional manuscripts that are in various stages of preparation to be submitted for publication, and on each of these I will be a named author/contributor., Scripps Memorial Hospital-Encinitas, California In an effort to personally witness the daily life of a physician, I shadowed two doctors for two weeks during a semester break. This occurred in the hospital setting. Dr. Kuriyama specializes in Infectious Disease. I accompanied him on his hospital rounds, observed his interactions with patients and hospital staff, and witnessed his detailed attention to the business of being a physician through his note-taking and charting of patient activity. I also shadowed Dr. Eisenberg, noticing the varied personalities of the doctors and how each approached their patient relationships. I was also able to scrub-in on several surgeries, which was both insightful and very exciting to watch.,  Laboratory Technician, National Charity League, San Diego del Norte Chapter National Charity League is a non-profit organization initiated to promote charitable endeavors, and the mother-daughter relationship. I performed over 500 hours of community service during my six years as a member of NCL.  I received the Mission Bell Award in 2003 (for over 50 hours to one charity), the Heart of Gold Award in 2002 (for over 75 hours) and the Yellow Bell Award in 2005 for over 100 hours of community service I preformed at the Helen Woodward Animal Center. My most meaningful NCL experiences occurred when I gave my service to those organizations most in need of personal interaction: nursing home residents, meals-on-wheels and the sheltered animals at Helen Woodward., Dean's List; Bachelor of Science Degree with Honors The Deans' Honors List recognizes students each quarter, with a grade point average equal to or higher than the minimum grade point average attained by the upper 16 percent of those registered in the same class level and college. I achieved this honor in 2008 and 2009. I would have received this honor for three additional quarters in 2010, but took less credits than required for the Dean's List so I could accommodate working 30 hr/wk in the Functional Molecular Biology research lab. I was also honored at graduation with a Bachelor of Science degree, with Honors. I am very proud of my academic achievement as it validated my hard work and commitment to learning., Functional Molecular Biology Laboratory, Student Volunteer While in my last year of college, I worked in the Functional Molecular Biology lab as a student volunteer, not for course credit. My responsibilities included managing the inventory of laboratory materials, tracking and documenting laboratory finances, managing laboratory safety. I also processed and analyzed tissues and cells for a number of diverse projects focused on determining the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological and functional adaptations of muscle to exercise. For the most part, the projects I worked on utilized cell culture and western blotting techniques. My work product and efforts during this period of time led to my current employment in this same laboratory."

    "text": "Dr. Nzume traversed the muddy village roads each morning to check on the patients in the ward before his full day of clinic patients flooded the waiting area. However, this was not the only indication of his dedication: Dr. Nzume also knew the intricacies of each patient's diagnosis, along with his or her name, entire family history and collection of relatives- all without looking at a computer or a chart. It wasn't that his memory was photographic or that he spent hours in memorization; he was simply treating his own family. On one of my first nights in Cameroon, my host mother told me that in Kumba, everyone was family. While I, initially, possessed some doubts, my experiences with Dr. Nzume at Ejed Medical Clinic demonstrated that this was the mindset of the villagers in Kumba. Dr. Nzume treated each patient with the diligence and compassion of a family member, so that even in the face of adversity and a lack of resources, he provided people with hope. When I think about the kind of doctor that I want to be, my experiences in Cameroon resonate with me. Dr. Nzume never treated just a broken arm or an ailing appendix; he was a doctor who showed his patients true compassion. This approach to medicine is not only in line with my own attitude, but it has shown me a philosophy I hope to build my own practice on someday. My travels to Africa have bolstered my passion for medicine and have given me the drive to serve people living in the face of adversity- providing them with the treatment they deserve. \tLiving in Dayton, OH has offered me some very unique experiences that contribute to the person that I am. Growing up on a farm in a town (Big Rock, IL) whose population has yet to reach four digits, my move to the urban atmosphere of Dayton came as a bit of a shock. In particular, my experiences volunteering at the Gateway Shelter for Men have offered me insight into the problem of homelessness in the area. I contributed to the logistics of the shelter each week, but I benefited the most from the relationships I developed with the residents. Injuries which they could not afford to care for kept them out of work; many had grown up in poverty and abuse, and despite this, I watched countless men strive to care for their children and families. It was a wakeup call that prompted the thought: what can I do about this Hearing their stories helped me to grow in understanding the problem of poverty, and my service work has contributed to my passion to use my career as a physician and personal drive to help combat the problem. \tIt is this very desire to be a doctor who is able to provide optimal services to patients, regardless of their background, that contributes to my goal of becoming a physician. I have also spent a lot of time working and volunteering at Dayton Childrens Medical Center, and the physicians there have been instrumental in transforming this goal to reality. I have seen children come in for everything from a few stitches to major traumas, and watching the doctors not only treat their injuries, but also comfort them has shown me what a difference a doctor can make when a patient needs it most. Whether it was as simple as bringing them a popsicle for being brave or giving the parent a hug, their compassion paired with a dedication to providing the best treatment is something I will reflect in my own practice someday. From Dr. Nzume to the local doctors I've worked with, I have learned that practicing medicine is a profession that requires true passion for success. Not only this, but it takes a drive that has been thoroughly instilled in me since I arrived at the University of Dayton. I have complete confidence that given the opportunity, I will put forth all that I have to offer to my medical education, and I know I can thrive as a physician. Alpha Epsilon Delta Member As a part of this fraternity, I participate in many service, fundraising, and social activities throughout the year. Not only has the organization exposed me to doctor shadowing opportunities, but together we contribute to charity events, do our own fundraising, and host seminars at the University of Dayton. It has been a wonderful opportunity to collaborate with students who have similar interests and act not only as a system of support, but also as a group of friends during my college career. It has helped me to solidify my interests in medicine through consistent exposure to the field and contributed to my success as a premedical student at the University of Dayton., Beta Beta Beta Historian As historian of the biological honors fraternity, I was in charge of documenting events, updating bulletin boards, and contributing to the team of officers which lead the organization. I helped to begin a project that renovated the display case in our Science Center and also contributed as a regular member of the club in doing short and long term service events and attending seminars., Service Learning Experience As part of an effort to engage students in the quest to solve the major problem of homelessness in the Dayton area, I served at the Gateway Men's Shelter each week. I worked at the front desk under the manager in order to assist with daily operations at the shelter including mail and food distribution, operating the phones, and meeting the needs of the residents in any way that I could., Healing Hearts Vice President As Vice President of a club dedicated to providing students with opportunities to get involved with health care-related volunteering, I am in charge of coordinating the volunteers in Dayton Childrens Emergency Department. I work with the director of volunteer services to train students in September and then schedule students to cover four hour shifts each Sunday night for the hospital. I also assist in club operations by promoting the club, assisting with conducting meetings, and contributing new ideas for volunteering and guest speakers., Youth Education Center Volunteer Children whose parents are unable to get off work after school in the Dayton area are given the opportunity to come to Adventure Central to do homework, have dinner, and relax after school. Each week, I would assist as a homework helper for grade school age kids. I would act as a tutor while encouraging the kids to complete their homework independently and work with the other students. We would also interact with the kids by playing games or giving them someone to talk to, while maintaining a controlled and safe environment for them., Emergency Department Volunteer Each month since I have been a student at University of Dayton, I have spent time volunteering at Dayton Childrens Emergency Department. I help maintain the flow of patients by cleaning rooms after visits, playing with the children or bringing them toys to occupy them, and watching patients if their parents need to step out of the room. I also bring patients and their families anything they need and assist the charge nurse in any way I can., Microbiology Laboratory Prep I prepare all reagents and media for use in the microbiology labs offered at University of Dayton. This includes frequent use of the autoclave in order to sterilize different types of agar and broth, along with glassware and other frequently used lab equipment. This position has made me familiar with many commonly used bacteria in labs and the different nutrients they depend upon which allow for their growth., Honors Thesis In effort to delve into my interests in Psychology, I decided to pursue research on factors that motivate younger people to disclose higher amounts of information on the social networking site Facebook. I developed a study involving 60 undergraduate students who will fill out a validated measure of internet privacy concern along with collecting their Facebook privacy information and demographics to perform a data analysis. My hope is to contribute to this field of scholarship and gain insight into a phenomenon which has become an increasingly important factor in the potential success of college students.,  Microbiology Lab Prep, Cross-Cultural Immersion On a mission to totally immerse ourselves in African culture, I travelled with a group of students to Cameroon for four weeks. Not only were we able to learn the social and economic dynamics of the country by visiting major government and industry sites, but we also lived with host families to experience day to day life. For two weeks, I was placed in Ejed Medical Clinic in Kumba under the supervision of the sole doctor along with the staff. This provided me with the opportunity to help with patient visits, learn laboratory procedures for malaria and typhoid, and observe medical procedures first-hand.,  Sterilization Sciences Intern, John W. Berry Sr. Scholar This is an exclusive group of 30 scholars who were chosen among the 2008 incoming freshman class to serve as leaders in the university community based on exemplary leadership, academic record and character. Together, we participate in a series of seminars designed to promote all areas of education including engineering, history, English, etc. As a Berry Scholar I am also required to develop an individual thesis, and I am living in an honors house my senior year assigned to promote building community on my street., Sterlization Sciences Intern This summer I am assisting the sterilization scientists at the Ethicon Endo-Surgery division of Johnson & Johnson. I have been intensively reviewing the standards for sterilization of surgical equipment via processes using ethylene oxide and radiation. We are condensing the standards information in order to launch a website for the engineers to consult to obtain parameter information, and I am helping to compute statistical data regarding the efficacy of the sterilization procedures., Synagis Clinic Assistant Throughout the peak RSV season for infants, I assisted the Synagis clinic coordinator in organizing weekly clinics to administer the shot to infants and toddlers. This work consisted of documenting referrals electronically, keeping track of diagnoses and patient visits, and helping during the clinic days by calling patients and taking their weights."

    "text": "As I run down the streets in the pre-dawn darkness, I cannot help but notice a similarity between marathon training and preparing for medical school. Both require hours and hours of hard work and determination for months and years before the real reward can be reaped, with the end seeming like it will never be reached. However, whether it is running in the freezing cold and sweltering sun or spending late nights and all of my free time studying, each activity is its own reward. My marathon training culminated with the running the Boston Marathon in 2010, and my goal to have this achievement paralleled in my academic career by my acceptance into medical school.  In my career at the University of Cincinnati, I have gotten my academic life back on track, making the Dean's List every quarter despite working 30 hours a week at the Veterans Hospital. In the core science classes I have performed well, especially in Biology and Physics. In addition to these required courses, I have also taken a number of Health Science classes and science electives with great success. I feel that my hard work in these various science classes while working almost full time has prepared me to handle the heavy course load in the first year of medical school that is such a challenge for many students.  After leaving Fifth Third, my plan was to pursue a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree. While attending UC, I began working in the PM&R department of the VA to see physical therapists at work. While working with the PTs, I also came in contact with many of the physicians, convincing me to pursue medicine. My work at the VA has been very rewarding, exposing me to many of the diverse roles in a hospital, including the administrative positions, outpatient physical and occupational therapy, inpatients recovering from surgery, speech and audiology, and the doctors themselves. I was also in contact with many veterans during my employment which has helped me see the patient's perspective when it comes to health care. I have learned that all of these roles are essential for a hospital to run smoothly and for patient care to be optimal, which is a lesson I feel will be invaluable when I become a doctor myself. While shadowing physicians, I saw the relief the patients feel as they start to get answers for their conditions, but I was also shown the great responsibility the doctor bears for his decisions. After my exposure to the health care environment at the VA and my shadowing experiences, I feel my talents and abilities are best suited for the medical field.  Before making these steps toward becoming a physician, I attended Miami University. While at Miami, I chose to major in Finance, a selection based on being able to find a job after graduation. I realized that this was not the major for me midway through my junior year but decided to keep pursuing my degree in order to graduate in four years. This lack of excitement for this field can be seen in my grades from this period of my life. After graduation I was hired at a Fifth Third Bank as an analyst. While working for the Risk Management division, looking over loan applications and risk portfolios, I felt myself slowly drifting through life, without any drive or passion. My pursuit of a Finance degree and my employment at Fifth Third did teach me one invaluable lesson: doing what you love is the most important thing in life and it will eventually lead to success and happiness.  In addition to academics and employment, I have also volunteered with different service groups with my church and in other areas. The most important of these to me was going to the El Hogar School in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. I was inspired by the value the students placed on things many of us take for granted: home, life necessities and education. Their gratitude and drive to succeed were both humbling and inspiring. At this school, I was able to see terrible poverty, but also the joy that hope can bring. I saw this same poverty, but also the same hope when I participated in the Appalachian Service Project in Buchannan County, Virginia. Having spent my entire life with access to doctors and dentists, it was amazing to me to see these people, both in the US and Honduras, who have never received professional medical treatment. Closer to home than either of these service projects is the work I have done with my little brother, who was born with microcephaly. My parents, my brothers and I have all been affected by my brother's condition, as we have tried to help him live as normal a life as possible. From helping with his soccer league for mentally handicapped children, TOPSoccer, to enabling him to live on his own and have two jobs, we have all worked to give him as many options as he could want.   Working with the children, whether at El Hogar, in Appalachia or with my brother, has made me want to pursue pediatrics as my first choice of study. However, I am looking forward to experiencing all of the different rotations, to see which specialty is the best fit for me. If accepted to this college of medicine, I will use all of the hard work and motivation I have gained over the course of my life to succeed and flourish in this field, so that one day I will be helping to improve the lives of thousands of other. Post Miami Employment After graduating from Miami, I worked part time at Starbucks for three months while searching for a full time job in finance or banking. I then was hired by Fifth Third Bank, where I worked in the risk management department. Initially, I worked downtown, reviewing loan portfolios and learning the risk management field. I experienced a number of different roles while training, from the initial research done on each applicant, to the actual underwriting that went into the actual loan. I then moved to the operations building, where I performed the research part of the process. This involved reviewing financials, ensuring licenses, and looking at current and past investment activities., Surgeon Shadowing After meeting with Dr. Bischle, I met with her colleague, Dr. Welsh, a general surgeon doing his outpatient clinic. Like the pain clinic at the VA, this doctor worked with many suffering patients. Unlike the VA, Dr. Welsh put his patients at ease by getting right to business, which let them know he was focused on their improvement. After he finished seeing patients, Dr. Welsh spoke at length with me about specialties and how the specialty chooses the doctor, not the other way around. His advice to me on this was to go into each rotation with an open mind, as you never know which one might fit perfectly.,  Analist, Miami DU Activities As a member of Delta Upsilon, I was in charge of both the year round athletics and our Greek Week athletic teams. This position involved making sure our teams were signed up for sports including the finances for the sign up fees, keeping the records for members of the teams and results of the games, and ensuring that each event had enough members to play. In addition to these positions, I was involved in organizing a 5k fundraiser for disabled children, the Run for Regan, and I was responsible for my fraternity's participation in an annual blood drive held on campus., Camp Counselor APD As camp counselor at the Anderson Park District, I worked with children between the ages of 5 and 12. In this job, I planned activities for my small group of 8-10 kids, and for the whole camp of around 70 children. I also developed my conflict resolution skills, working with concerned parents when a minor incident such as a bee sting or sunburn occurred.   To me, the most interesting aspect of this job was to see the development of the kids year to year, watching as their balance and language skills improved each successive summer., VA Medical Center As I began attending UC, I wanted to make sure I avoided the mistake I made while at Miami: entering a field in which I had little to no experience. Since I initially returned to school to become a physical therapist, I started working in the PT clinic at the Cincinnati VA.  Working in this clinic allowed me to see the type of day-to-day work PTs do. Since this clinic is part of the larger Rehabilitation Care Line, I also was in contact with a wide range of other specialties, including speech and occupational therapists, audiologists, RNs and LPNs. This role also provided me experience with the physicians in the care line, including those in physical medicine, psychiatry and primary care.,  Clerical, ASP 98-99 Each year, my church sends around 30 members on the Appalachian Service Project.  Each trip lasts one week, but the planning and fund raising for these trips starts 6 months prior. I participated on two of these service trips. On both trips, we spent the majority of our time tearing down rotten structures and starting to rebuild newer, safer ones. The most influential part of these trips was not the hard work we did, but the poverty I saw. As a teen from a middle class family, this really drove home the fact that there is real poverty in the US, with a large percentage of our population living with little access to things we take for granted, like medical or dental care., Batesville Children's Following Dr. Plunkett's advice, I sought out doctors outside of the VA to see how the private sector was different than the public. I have always been interested in working with children, so I decided to shadow Dr. Bischle at the Children's Health Care clinic. I was able to observe from her how to work with both the patient and the parent at the same time, involving both to reduce their anxiety. I found it interesting that she would first speak directly to the child to see what was wrong. Only after the child had identified the problem did Dr. Bischle confirm this with the parent. This strategy seemed to make the child feel involved and more likely to discuss what the problem actually was., Club Soccer In addition to actually playing soccer as a member of the Miami University Club Soccer team, I helped plan the logistics of our away games, and helped reserve and prepare the fields for our home games. In my junior year, we made the national tournament in Austin, TX, and I helped with fundraising and planning the trip., El Hogar In the month before I started at UC, I was given the opportunity to be one of the adult leaders for a group teenagers heading to Honduras on a mission trip to the El Hogar school. This involved supervising the teens, both on the work site and off. I also participated in the construction work this group was doing, helping to demolish a building and carting cement and dirt for the new foundation. While there, I had many chances to spend time with the children at the school, most of whom were orphans. Their bright spirits despite the terrible poverty they had endured was amazing to see, and I think about these children whenever things seem difficult in my own life., TOPSoccer TOPSoccer is a program designed to allow mentally handicapped kids to participate in group athletics for exercise and to see what it is like to be on a team.  My brother, who loves playing sports, but is limited by his mental handicap, was one of the first signed up for this league. Since I have been lucky enough to be able to play soccer my entire life, I wanted to share this opportunity with these kids, including my brother. I worked as a referee, which mainly meant I was there to ensure that the game proceeded safely and that the kids were having fun. This allowed them to actually play the sport, escaping their role as constant spectators., Marathon Running Training for and running marathons has become an important part of my life, ever since completing my first one in 2007.  Since then, I have participated in 5 others, including Boston and Chicago, with plans to continue to run as it fits with my schedule. I have found that running parallels my academic work, in that it is impossible to successfully cram for either a marathon or an exam. Both require dedication, consistency and hard work., Dean's List Upon starting at UC, I knew I not only needed to complete the prerequisites for medical school, but I also needed to do exceptionally well in them to recover from my Miami GPA.  After struggling with the return to school in my first chemistry class, I have performed quite well in my classes, earning the Dean's List every quarter since returning to school. I feel that I have definitely shown the dedication and commitment through this effort that will allow me to continue my academic career in medical school., VA Shadowing While working at the VA Medical Center, I have had many opportunities to shadow Dr. Plunkett, a PM&R doctor.  Dr. Plunkett works in the pain clinic at the VA, and I was able to see a variety of patients, from an above knee amputee, to a truck driver with degenerative disk disease. One important lesson I have learned from shadowing Dr. Plunkett is to go into each patient meeting with a positive attitude and an air of professionalism. Many of the patients he sees are in real pain, causing them to be irritated and upset before the doctor even enters the room. Dr. Plunkett's sincere compassion and understanding helps relax the patient, allowing him to better serve the patient's needs."

    "text": "Ciencia y Caridad (Science and Charity) is the title of a painting by Pablo Picasso that stood out to me as I perused the Pablo Picasso Museum in Barcelona. This painting depicts a dazed woman with a physician, who sits on the left side of the canvas, checking her pulse while a nun, who holds a child in one hand, is offering her a cup of tea from the other. Picasso's artwork reminded me of why I want to enter the medical field and the balance of scientific knowledge and compassion I hope to achieve and maintain while training to become a physician.  I was born in Jamaica, and lived there for the majority of my elementary school years. In conversations about future careers with female friends, we often spoke of becoming the next generation of teachers and nurses. Our horizons seemed limited but my thoughts were fixed on becoming a teacher. For me, the thought of playing such an important role in a child's development was fulfilling and I envisioned myself in that position with every chance I got. My parents often secretly watched on as I scolded and taught my furniture in an imaginary classroom.  My mother soon became a nursing student at the hospital adjacent to my school. Many evenings after school, I could be found waiting in an examination room until my mother's classes ended. I remember taking a long look at the waiting area one evening as one man leaned back into his chair with folded arms while a mother close by tried to keep her little one occupied. The amount of time these people were waiting showed on their faces. My young mind questioned: What are their reasons for waiting How could I be of any help   When my family moved from Jamaica, the United States became the place where our horizons broadened, especially through education. My parents frequently encouraged me and my brothers to fully dedicate ourselves to our studies. For me, involvement in school became a productive distraction from the reality of starting life over in tight spaces without relatives or familiar faces close by. From after-school dissections to my Six Flags field trip, science classes became the most engaging to me.   My interest in science was supported by a health conscious household. My mother, who worked as a registered nurse, decided to pursue her doctorate in medicine. My father, who initially wanted to be a health inspector, is now a pastor in the Seventh-day Adventist church and took the healthy lifestyle teachings of our faith seriously. From stories of my mother's encounters with patients to the funeral services my father presided over, the importance of health became clearer, leading me to pursue a pre-medicine concentration in college. I initially declared a Biochemistry major for my freshman year at New York University (NYU). However, I was new to the set-up of college classes and soon realized the numerous science lectures I would be a part of every semester for four years. Being immersed in science was admirable, but I craved the balance, as pictured in Picasso's painting. I sought to include a humanities perspective by taking classes towards an Africana Studies major. Courses such as African Americans, Africa and Pan-Africanism allowed me to delve into discussions about the inequalities and injustices people of the African Diaspora faced in their respective communities.  Another course that was centered on globalization introduced me to how social and economic factors affected people's access to healthcare. I learned about how Structural Adjustment Programs in African and Caribbean countries shifted the leaders' focus to the country's economic growth and away from improving social services such as healthcare. Without an emphasis on healthcare in these developing countries, women and children are especially left susceptible to preventable infectious diseases. With this knowledge, my previous question rang out again: How could I be of any help What can I do to prepare myself to make an effective contribution to the health field  In addition to my participation in organizations mentoring and tutoring children, I realized that I also wanted to focus more on women. I was amazed to see how coursework from a Master of Arts in Women's Health coincided with my coursework from NYU. I became familiar with global inequities in health issues such as maternal mortality but I wanted to learn about the science behind conditions such as sepsis and eclampsia. These studies all seemed to paint a picture of how I could combine my experiences to enhance the quality of life for the undeserved, both here in the United States and in developing areas such as my hometown, Mount Salem. I have come to realize that my initial dream to become a teacher is best fulfilled by becoming a primary care physician. Medical school training will provide me with the skills and knowledge not only to treat but to instruct patients, and offer screenings and preventative care which can ultimately foster a healthier society.  Administrative, Operations Assistant For this position I offered primary administrative assistance to the Residence Hall Manager by reorganizing the filing system and completing various other office projects and errands. I assisted the Residence Hall Receptionists with mail sorting and the distribution of student packages. I also completed protocol dormitory room checks with the Graduate Housing Assistant., Cluster Tutor For this position, I was responsible for teaching lessons in literacy and math to a small class of third-grade scholars.

I presented a session to students once each semester on body image and teen pregnancy options with a fellow mentor. Recipient of the Outstanding Mentor Award., Summer Health Career Intern I was assiged to the Labor and Delivery, Mother-Baby and Breastfeeding Departments. I provided assistance for charge nurses and unit clerks in areas regarding patient service and administrative work. For example, I assisted by preparing rooms for expectant mothers, helping to transfer patients, delivering meals and assuring that necessary supplies were readily acessible., Singer I was encouraged to join NYU's All-University Gospel Choir (AUGC) prior to my freshman year and became an active member serving on the executive board. I enjoy singing and currently do so for special events., Patient Service Co-ordinator St. Mary's Hospital for Children has a program in which patients are offered long term healthcare services within their homes. A nurse is assigned to each patient and writes up orders about the types of care each patient is receiving. My position allows me to communicate with nurses on whether orders are ready to be sent out to patients' physicians. I manage the organization and processing of these home healthcare orders. I also have the opportunity to advocate for patients by taking outstanding orders to their doctors to be reviewed and signed so their services can continue., Literacy Tutor The time range mentioned above took place at P.S. 1 in Manhattan, which is also known as the Alfred E. Smith. I also worked at the Ross Global Academy Charter School in Manhattan from September 2006 to May 2007. Over the course of both assignments, I worked with smaller groups of 2-5 during class, lunch breaks and after school hours. I was able to offer individual attention to students who needed help. I built on helpful techniques that would improve a child's reading or math proficiency. I also provided additional assistance with class projects and the grading of homework and exams and upheld the disciplinary rules of the teachers in their absence., Mentor This position placed me in contact with underclassman who was also had a pre-medicine concentration. I was available as a source of academic and social support."

    "text": "My parents have always told me that if you truly enjoy your work, it is not like work at all. They encouraged me to find a career that genuinely interests me for my own happiness and because they believe that enjoying your job will result in greater success. I began to seriously consider their advice at the beginning of high school and I came to the realization that I was fascinated by the field of medicine. I was always entertained when learning about the human body in science classes and I always enjoyed asking my doctors for details when I was sick or injured. Teachers and doctors appreciated my enthusiasm and interest in these subjects and I discovered that I could use this interest to pursue a career in medicine. I began to talk to my uncle who is a cardiologist to get a better perspective on this field and discovered that, despite long hours and stressful situations, he could not imagine having any other career. This encouragement was a key factor in my decision to pursue a medical education along with my propensity for the sciences. I have not only been interested in the sciences from a young age but I have also excelled in them more than any other area of study. I decided that my natural scientific abilities combined with a strong work ethic and genuine interest would make a medical career ideal for me. I therefore decided to pursue a pre-medical education as an undergraduate in chemistry at Clemson University.  Throughout my undergraduate career, I have been encouraged further to pursue a career in medicine and I have found that my experience so far confirms that I have made the right choice. I remain enthusiastic about the medical applications discussed in my undergraduate courses and often find myself doing further research on relevant topics. Outside of my coursework, I have also been given opportunities to gain experience and insight in to different aspects of a medical career. Through research and shadowing I have been able to see doctor-patient interactions in a number of situations. This aspect of medicine is not something I considered thoroughly before these experiences but it is something I enjoy as much as any other part of medicine. These experiences have also allowed me to see how residents and medical students are trained and educated in a hospital setting. I was fortunate enough to talk to residents and ask them about their experiences throughout their recent medical education. The general excitement of these students and doctors has inspired even more confidence in my decision to enter the medical field.  As I continue my education and training, I look forward to the excitement of a future career in medicine. This is a field that I am passionate about and that I am ready to invest my time in. I hope to build upon my undergraduate success in medical school and eventually as a physician. I will continue aspiring to follow my parents' advice fully and enjoy my work completely. I believe that my enthusiasm will not only lead to personal satisfaction but also to the health and well-being of many others.

    "text": "She walked slowly into the room with tears welling up in her eyes and a light bulb in her hand. She pleaded that I come to her room to replace the broken bulb and make things right. Georgie is a resident at the assisted living home where I have worked for nearly three years and a long time sufferer of obsessive compulsive disorder. For her the thought of completing her morning routine without her lamp working was traumatizing and elicited the emotional response I was now faced with. Before she came to me she had already sought help from a nurse -- to no avail. Not helping her failed to cross my mind and it shocked me that someone else would be callous enough to ignore her emotions. I changed the bulb and watched as a look of total relief came across Georgie's face freeing her from the anxiety that had filled the preceding minutes. This was not the first, nor the last, time she and I found ourselves in a similar situation.   It may not come as a surprise that Georgie requires constant reassurance and near exact consistency throughout her day in order to feel comfortable and in control. This often pushes her to ask the same questions time and again. Not everyone has the patience for this, and many of my co-workers brush her off giving her little more than irritated one word responses. However, beneath her compulsive behavior and obsessive routine is a real person -- a polite southern mother of two, a former flight attendant, and a caring grandmother. When she approaches me, I treat each question as if it's being asked for the first time, responding with detail and a friendly tone. I can see that she appreciates it, and deep down I know she's getting the reassurance and human compassion she needs to be happy.  Georgie is a daily reminder of why I want to be in medicine. Put most simply I want to help people by expressing compassion. However, there have been other impactful events that have supported my passion. I spent over a year volunteering in the emergency department of a local hospital. The experience provided me some essential firsthand experience into the world of healthcare. I had the opportunity to interact with the patients and watch as they progressed from admittance to discharge working all the while to make their time as comfortable as possible. Despite all that exposure, nothing prepared me for what I heard one morning.   On my way back from the supply room with several bags of saline I heard the most agonizing and emotional plea for help. For some reason her loud yet helpless plea particularly affected me and has stuck with me to this day. The patient, I quickly learned, had acute cholecystitis. The condition was the result of an inflamed gall bladder and caused severe attacks of abdominal pain which had yet to be alleviated by the drugs the doctor had prescribed. The pain I witnessed was just one episode in a string of attacks that had been happening over the preceding months while she waited to be seen at a clinic for people without insurance.  Just as with Georgie, something inside myself pulled me to this woman and looking into her tear filled eyes and watching as her husband clenched her hand I was overcome with a desire to help her. As a volunteer I could not offer much more than a warm blanket and some friendly reassurance, but I knew that one day I wanted to be in a position to help someone like her more directly.  These experiences have solidified my desire to become a physician, but they were not alone in their influence. I have always had a love for biology. The human body fascinates me and I often found myself absorbed by Dr. Close-Jacob's physiology lectures. I cannot help but run through biologic processes in my mind because the way the body works in harmony is both interesting and beautifully elegant to me. Biology as a body of knowledge is alive and constantly changing. New insights are discovered everyday and that possibility for discovery is partially what drives me. I have always loved a challenge and through its often unclear answers science provides that challenge to me.   Communicating why I want to be a doctor can be a daunting task because it is a feeling that comes from a life of experiences. Over the course of my college career at Xavier the single most important thing I have come to realize about medicine is that it's not all about the science, the facts and memorizing details. Medicine is about people. Each of us is connected in basic essential ways to those around us. Perhaps Georgie seems distant to my apathetic co-workers. After all she is at least 60 years older than most of us and not related in a familial way. Just the same maybe that woman from the emergency room was just a case number to the clinic that had her waiting in pain for her surgery. Nonetheless to me Georgie and the gall bladder patient were people and they really were not that much different from myself. Each of us is a part of one humanity and we have to both realize this and respect the implications. Being a physician doesn't just mean caring for a 90 year old woman with OCD or a 35 year old woman with gall stones. What it means is compassionately caring for people by using the tools provided to us through science, and there is no other field that will allow me to help people in that way. Independently Organized Alzheimer's Benefit After seeing how Alzheimer's affected my family and the residents at my job I wanted to organize a fundraiser. By contacting a local businessman I was able to get a beautiful venue donated at no cost. Over the course of several months and many phone calls and letters I secured additional donations to support the fundraiser. The evening offered live harp music, desserts, coffee, a presentation from a scientist working in the field of Alzheimer's research, and a silent auction. I was able to get custom postcards donated and I distributed more than 300 of them. With the help of a newspaper story and word of mouth the evening was a success and a donation was made to the Alzheimer's Association., Alpha Epsilon Delta Alpah Epsilon Delta is the pre-professional health honor society. Application comes only after invitation. The admission process is competiive and requires high academic achievement as well as a dedication to the health field. AED is both an honor society as well as a service organization. As a member I am required to complete and document a minimum of 15 service hours per semester. Additionally, AED provides opportunities to hear guest speakers and learn more about the health field. I was accepted in May 2011 and inducted later that year in September. The organization has been in existence since 1926 and promotes lifelong communication between health professionals., Alpha Sigma Nu Alpha Sigma Nu is the honor society of Jesuit colleges and universities. The society upholds the Jesuit traditions of scholarship, loyalty and service. Applicaton comes only after invitation. Alpha Sigma Nu invites applicants from the top tier of the school and accepts only those who exhibit those core values of the Jesuit tradition. As an inducted member I am expected to maintain academic excellence and a committment to service. Being a lifelong member will provide me networking opportunities with the society's other members across the country., Student Research Assistant at Wood Hudson As a student research assistant at Wood Hudson Cancer Research Laboratory I have had the opportunity to put to use many of the skills I have acquired during my education. Wood Hudson is a non-profit research organization and has a bio-specimen repository holding over 1 million tissue samples. Those clinical cases are used in studies focused on new methods of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cancer. A core goal at Wood Hudson is also to train future scientists and physicians with hands-on research experience. Through that goal I have had the opportunity to spend time working with research scientists in the lab, discussing scientific journal articles and planning projects., Alzheimer's Association Volunteer As a volunteer at the Alzheimer's association I spend four hours a week at their main Cincinnati chapter office working closely with the staff and other volunteers. My position is at the front desk. I answer and direct all phone calls and greet visitors. Additionally I perform small office tasks and provide support services to the staff. Everyone at the office treats their work with great respect and that comes across in their positive attitude and friendly personalities. Volunteering there is both rewarding and enjoyable., St. Elizabeth ER Volunteer As an emergency room volunteer I worked closely with the nurses, physicians and support staff in the department. I organized and stocked supplies, answered phones, retrieved instruments, cleaned patient rooms and made deliveries to other departments. Primarily though I provided customer service to the patients while they were in the care of the ER. From serving drinks to checking with the doctors for updates I was encouraged to do evertything I could to make the patient and his or her family comfortable and happy. My time at St. Elizabeth was a great lesson in health related customer service and also allowed me the opportunity to both talk with and observe the physicians and nurses at work., Christian Services International: Mission Trip Christian Services International has a permanent mission established in Salyersville, Kentucky near the Appalachian mountains. The region is economically distressed and many families live in poor conditions. Through the efforts of local churches mission groups comprised of volunteers of all ages come to the region to offer aid. To accomodate these volunteers one local church is in the process of building a dormitory faclity. As a part of the CSI mission group I worked on that project helping with general contruction tasks. Additionally, I spent 3 days of the week long trip helping local families with yard work and small household chores they couldn't otherwise complete due to age or time.,  Dietary Health Aid, Awards, Scholarships & Recognitions I am a Presidential Scholarship recipient at Xavier University. Presidentail scholarships are awarded for four years to incoming freshman with high academic achievement. The scholarship required I maintain a certain GPA throughout my college career.   I have been on the dean's list for the six consecutive semsters that I have been at Xavier.   I was recognized as one of two top students in the Biology department after freshman year.  I was awarded the Clem Luken Sr. award for achievement in intermediate German.   I was invited to join and accepted to both Alpha Sigma Nu and Alpha Epsilon Delta honor societies., Walk to End Alzheimers Committee I served as the chair for team recruitment for the 2011 Walk and was asked to be involved with the walk again for 2012. As a planning committee member I attended monthly meetings in order to communicate objectives, goals and progress with other committee members as well as staff at the Alzheimer's Association. As a co-chair for team recruitmnt I worked in the community recruiting volunteers to form walk teams. This often required visiting local businesses to speak with managers as well as making calls and sending out letters. As walk day drew closer I became more involved in planning and I assisted with registration the morning of the walk., Redwood Rehabilitation Redwood Rehabilitation provides support for adults and children with disabilities allowing them to achieve independence to their greatest potential. As a summer volunteer I spent time each week in the adult independence center. This area of Redwood sought to assist the clients in becoming proficient at using the computer for various tasks. While many of the adults spent a large portion of their day in the computer lab, others were just beginning to use the computers. I worked with those just starting out in order to introduce them to the computer controls. At times the computers had to be modified with large buttons and other input devices depending on the clients dexterity and needs., The Barington of Fort Thomas The Barrington is an assisted and independent living home which serves anywhere from 80-110 residents. All employees at the Barrington are encouraged to build relationships with the residents in order to foster personalized customer service. My employment in the dietary department is no exception. My job is to work each day to ensure that every resident has a comfortable and enjoyable dining experience. However, it entails more than the job of a typical waiter. Because many of our residents suffer from Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, caring for them often requires an extra level of compassion and patience. This is effectively achieved through building those personal relationships., University Scholars Program The University Scholars program is an honors program at Xavier University to which I was accepted prior to beginning my freshman year. The program is competitive and requires that many of Xavier's core curriculum classes such as Theology, Philosophy, English, History and Math be taken at the honors level. Honors level professors expect a higher level of performance of their students and tend to give more rigorous assessments. Additionally the University Scholars program requires taking three seminar style courses and expects a higher level of achievement in foreign language classes. The additional requirements mean that advanced planning and scheduling have been important to my success., Physician Shadowing Throughout the course of my undergraduate career I have spent time shadowing physicians in various specialties. I spent a day with the chief OB-GYN resident at Oklahoma State (Dec. 2010). I spent an entire week in the radiology dpeartment at University Hospital in Cincinnati with both residents and attending physicians (Jan. 2011) as well a day with a primary care physician there later that year (Nov. 2011). I shadowed a radiologist at Midwest Regional Hospital in Oklahoma (Dec. 2011). Additionally I spent some time observing in the cardiovasular ICU at University Hospital (April 2012). All of these experiences have been essential to my understanding of the daily life of a physician., Xavier Alliance & Freedom to Marry Xavier University Alliance is a gay-straight alliance that provides for education and discussion of LGBT isssues between students from all backgrounds. Additionally the group provides support and advocacy on campus and hosts periodic events. As a member of Alliance I attended weekly meetings and participated in group discussions around these issues. I was involved in Alliance Week during which we showed a relevant movie on campus and hosted a guest speaker. I organized a group on campus in support of Ohio Freedom to Marry and gathered petition signatures as a part of that group. I have remained active with Ohio Freedom to Marry gathering signatures at events around the city."

    "text": "My passion for science began at the age of four in the back of my parents' car, while leaving the drive-through of a McDonald's.  After many successful experiments, I discovered that my Chicken Mcnuggets would cool the fastest if I placed them in the four corners of the box, thusly, I could enjoy them more quickly.  Since exploiting thermodynamics proved fruitful, my attention turned toward kinematics.  I began testing whether my toy's velocity was independent of the motion of our car, and as my mother can attest, it was.  I was a curious young man, and the world was full of opportunity.   Upon entering college no one in my family, immediate or extended, had earned a college degree.  My parents are hardworking small business owners, who operate a small construction company. It was my hope to someday run it myself.  During my first year at Santiago Canyon College, I worked full-time for my parents in the field through the day, learning the foundation of their business, and enrolled in classes at night.  Before long, I had become a seasoned mason, and it was time to connect my knowledge from the ladder and scaffold to the blueprints behind them.  Shadowing my father, in the office, had an unintended effect.  Learning the ins-and-outs of running a business, peaked my curiosity for finance and accounting, and ultimately led me to study economics.  Upon my arrival at the University of California San Diego, I declared myself an economist.  My interest has always lied in the macro aspect of subjects; I prefer studying the effect one galaxy has on another to the interactions between individual atoms.  So naturally, when it came to economics, I aligned myself with funds, and industries as a whole, rather than individual stocks or firms. I found the health care industry particularly intriguing because it receives more scrutiny and exogenous influence than other markets, yet it can still be studied under the same economic framework.   \tHowever, after joining all of the economic clubs, and societies; taking classes and attending seminars, I felt my choice of study lacked substance.  Though we indirectly feel their effects, I was analyzing markets and structures that were entirely intangible, and I could not remember why I was compelled to study them in the first place.  In the final quarter of my first year, I joined clubs outside of my field, to search for a vocation with more depth.  Due to my interest in health economics I sought out the pre-dental society.  Though dentistry was not for me, I was exposed to the professional aspect of medicine, and discovered what I believed my field of study was lacking: a sense of service.  I had gone too far in economics to change my major, and I see now, how that would have been a mistake to do so.  I began supplementing my studies with premedical coursework, beginning with physics.  After the first lecture of mechanics, I knew I had made the right decision because my childhood curiosity had returned.  I was experimenting in the back of my parents' car again.  This turning point motivated me to excel in all areas, and graduate with honors.   I am fortunate that the majority of my time spent in hospitals has been voluntary through my experience as an emergency medical technician.  There is a unique sense of awareness aroused while attending a patient in the back of the ambulance, amidst the lights and sirens.  One's senses are somehow both amplified and dampened simultaneously; it is as exciting as it is frightening. These situations teach perspective because when everything is on the line, the little things become inconsequential.  The first patient I ever brought to the emergency room was an elderly man suffering from angina. Knowing I was a trainee, the paramedic who had seen such cases countless times before, let me handle the assessment while she prepared the IV.  Flowing through the mnemonics I had practiced in class the night before, I extracted vital information to report to the nurse upon arrival.  The bustling ER was fresh out of beds, so the physician greeted us in the hallway.  The methodical, yet genuine, manner in which he attended the patient; the way he examined every inch of his body without breaking eye contact, is what I reminisce of every time I arrive on scene to a call.   \tServing my community, as an EMT, has taught me two lessons, which resonate above all the rest.  First, the circumstances requiring an ambulance tend to elicit nearly identical responses from people, regardless of race or cultural upbringing.  Moments of fear reveal one's true character, and I can attest that we are all the same at our core.  We all expect, and deserve, the highest level of health care.  Secondly, I have realized, though I may be in the trenches now, I am working towards something I truly desire.  My journey to medicine has not been direct, and for that I am thankful.  After all, one's life is not a state function.  The paths we choose are what distinguish us from one another.  The systemic nature of emergency medicine is what drew me in, and the variance amongst cases, is what quenches my curiosity.  Someday, I hope to inspire a young EMT the same way I was inspired, and perpetuate the tradition of compassionate health care. Environmental Volunteer Although I am allergic to cats, dogs, and almost every plant species I have encountered, I am obsessed with every type of animal that walks, or swims, this earth.  I aim to find as many opportunities as possible to help all species either directly: by cleaning up their natural homes, or indirectly: by raising awareness. With ROOTS, our primary focus is the eradication of non-native plants, which out-compete the native species and ultimately disrupt the shelter, and trophic levels, of local animals.  I also devote time to the Tucker Wildlife Sanctuary during bat night, and bird day.  These events are designed to raise eco-awareness in the community, and acquire funding for the sanctuary., Volunteer Abroad As a physician, I plan to donate time providing medical relief to children in underserved areas; the girls of Los Angelitos orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico saw to that.  Planning our trip, and visiting the orphanage, gave me a small, yet lasting taste of servitude, which I will continue to chase throughout my life.  Upon arriving to Tijuana, we were greeted by the children, and joined them on their bus back to the orphanage.  On the bus, they helped me with my Spanish, and I ruined their rendition of Shakira.  One of the girls, Michella, I was particularly fond of, and during my stay we were inseparable.  She showed me the wild horses grazing in the hills, and the joys of living a simple life., Emergency Medical Technician Volunteer/Skills Evaluator As a practicing Emergency Medical Technician, it is necessary to seek out opportunities to immerse yourself in the less common protocols of your scope of practice.  Living in temperate southern California, the chances of coming across a patient presenting with heat stroke is not too common.  When athletes racing from Baker to Las Vegas (120 miles) are depending on you for medical support, you better be well versed in the subject.  I have volunteered my time for this race two years in a row.   Another way I keep my skills sharp is through assisting my own instructor, Captain Weinert of Laguna Beach Fire Department, in assessing the skills of his current EMT classes., Undergraduate Biology Teacher's Assistant As a teacher's assistant, I was charged with: running weekly discussion sections, proctoring exams, and moderating the course's online discussion forum.  The hour-long discussion section provided me with time to reiterate central themes covered in lecture, and administer a short quiz; which I had prepared during the preceding week.  Though attendance was mandatory, the enthusiasm shown by my students was not, and ultimately, that is what made it all worthwhile.  I have continued my passion for teaching through The Berkeley Review MCAT Preparation and The Orangewood Children and Family Center.  Some day I hope to teach an EMT course., Research Protocol Development At Inscent, I have begun working more extensively with the honey bee.  Current repellents are seemingly harmful to the bees in that they alter their feeding patterns, and ultimately lead to colony collapse disorder.  Our aim is to search for new repellents, which will not cause such behavior. I was fortunate enough to be charged with writing the protocol for our newest behavioral assay.  At this point in time, we are testing a family of compounds which are proving to be promising.   This assay is challenging because it requires the tester to think like a bee.  Bees employ so many different signals, we have to note and interpret these signals in a quantitative and qualitative manner., Observer of Internal Medicine Becoming a physician is like the light at the end of the tunnel.  Observing Dr. Collins in both hospital and clinical settings, has made me realize how much further, and brighter that light actually is.  As an EMT, I have the opportunity to practice bedside manner, and I've gotten quite good at it, but Dr. Collins and his twenty-five years of experience has shown me what it really is; and when used correctly, how powerful it can be.  His vast wealth of knowledge, and continuing betterment, are both inspirational and daunting.  These emotions drive me to become the compassionate physician society expects, and deserves., Emergency Department Volunteer I serve as a volunteer within the Emergency Department, and if needed, assist in other departments as well.  My duties consist of ensuring patient safety and comfort by supporting the hospital staff, and direct patient contact.   I have made the transition from the ambulance to the ED, and retain my EMT national certification, Thus I am able to maintain a hands-on role under physician direction.   I enjoy working directly with the interdisciplinary team of the ED staff, and relish the opportunity to learn from different points of view., Emergency Medical Technician I was employed as an Emergency Medical Technician-Basic, by Pacific Ambulance Service, in Orange County, California.  Through Pacific, I have gained experience on basic life support, paramedic, critical care, respiratory therapy, PICU, and NICU units.  Performing as an EMT requires calm wits, and a strong constitution, because we operate in the pre-hospital setting.  My favorite unit to work on was basic life support.  The BLS unit operates with only two EMTs, and no higher level of care.  This allowed me to assess the patients myself, and to call ALS if I deemed it necessary.  Ultimately, I developed my skill set, and learned when a situation required a higher level of care., Lecturer of Physics, Organic Chemistry and General Chemistry In my opinion, the most efficient way to learn something yourself is to teach it to someone else.  My experience as a lecturer in the physical and biological sciences, for The Berkeley Review, has made me appreciate the sacrifice any great teacher must make, and the reward for doing so.  Students, like patients, come from different backgrounds, and learn differently.  Our country's economy relies on preventative medicine to keep health care costs low, and thus the modern physician requires the same skills as a teacher; to educate their patients on healthy living styles, and provide techniques to avoid future ailments., Food Bank Volunteer Most of my time at the food bank was spent in the warehouse: sorting and shipping foodstuffs; the remainder was spent in the office.  The most amazing aspect of warehouse duty was the level of altruism flowing through the volunteers.  Every day, new groups of people would show up in their organizational t-shirts, ready to get dirty, and make their world a better place.  In the office, I witnessed the tireless efforts of people from all different backgrounds, and skill-sets collaborating to bring in new supplies, and offer thanks to those who had already given.  Though I was never able to personally deliver the products to their recipients, I took pride in being a small part of the process., Molecular Biology Research Scientist My primary focus, as a molecular biology research assistant, is the extraction and purification of target proteins within certain species of insects.  Obtaining the final proteins, of course, requires more than just liquefying the insects, and sifting through the remains; in practice, we use bacteria.  As many laboratories do, we find the gene sequence - in the animal's DNA - that codes for the target protein, perform slight modifications on that gene, and ultimately express that protein with transformed bacteria.  Aside from the micro aspect described above, I also have the opportunity to test behavioral responses in the animals as well, such as the proboscis extension reflex of honeybees., Science Education Development at the Orangewood Center The Orangewood Children and Family Center is an entity of the Orange County Social Services system.  Children from ages zero to seventeen are brought to Orangewood immediately after being removed from their parents or guardians custody.  Orangewood holds the children for up to thirty days while the court system decides where they will be sent.  My responsibility as a volunteer is to spend time with the kids, and help their transition be as easy as possible., Salkmobile: Mobile Laboratory Volunteer The Salkmobile mobile science lab serves the community by rousing excitement in biological science, at local middle schools. Thanks to Salk, children as young as ten are given the opportunity to perform experiments ranging from DNA extraction to gel electrophoresis.  While asking, Can I eat the gel, is the most common response we receive, I am pleasantly humbled by the curiosity displayed by these kids.   With the Salkmobile, I also attend events such as high school science day, and the San Diego Science Festival, where we perform similar services. My journey with the Salkmobile inspired me to write a lecture and laboratory for children at the Orangewood Children and Family Center., Undergraduate Economics Society The Undergraduate Economics Society helped to bridge the gap between students and professors.  To be accurate, the faculty played a more formidable role than the students did, we just ordered the pizza.  Through the club, I gained the opportunity to participate in many budding professors' research experiments ranging in topics from game theory to decisions under uncertainty.  It was during my time with the club that I met Dr. Melissa Famulari, and began my journey towards medicine through health economics., Automotive Repair This year I performed an overhaul on my 1997 BMW, though it was not entirely my decision.  After preventatively replacing the radiator, coolant pump, and thermostat, my car decided that it needed a new clutch as well.  After removing the exhaust and driveshaft, uncoupling the shifter, and dropping the transmission, I was able to install a new clutch, pressure plate, and release bearing.  If nothing else, this was an exercise in patience.   Automotive repair is like anything else that follows a protocol such as cooking, research, and even medicine.  All that is different are the stakes. Firing up the ignition for the first time was amazing.  I truly felt accomplished."

    "text": "As I stared at the massive glacier in front of me, I searched for Cabane de Bertol. The destination point, a cabin high within the Alps of Switzerland, seemed so far off that it was barely visible, yet there it was, glistening in the sun. I am scared of heights, but that fear has never stopped me before, and it certainly would not stop me now. I started gearing up, putting my crampons over my hiking boots and tying a rope around my waist. In no time, I was ready to go, and all I had to do was take that first step on the hard glacier ice.  \tFor as long as I can remember, I have dreamed of going to medical school and becoming a working physician. My work until this point has been akin to gearing up for a climb up the face of a mountain, looking ahead towards the future as well as looking around to enjoy the view. I would not let my fear of heights keep me from reaching the mountaintop; similarly, I will not turn away a challenge for fear of failure. My freshman year biology course in high school gave me the love and desire I needed to pursue a career in the medical industry. I enjoyed that class so much that it inspired me to take more biology and physiology courses. Throughout my high school and college career of taking various science classes, my fascination with the human body has only increased.  The idea of going to medical school grew along with my fascination for biology, and now I cannot imagine doing anything different. \tMy journey to this point has had its ups and downs, just as there are peaks and valleys in a hike. Sometimes the path seems impossible while at other times, it is wide open and full of breathless beauty. Moving to a new country and learning a different language at the age of nine was both challenging and scary.  Until fourth grade, I lived in Belgium and spoke only Dutch. Then, suddenly my entire world changed when I moved to the United States and English became the predominant language. However, in this new culture, I found greater rewards than I could have imagined. Working with deaf children for three years has been one of those rewards. Working with these children has given me a desire to explore the field of pediatrics. Additionally, they have given me a further appreciation for sign language; not only do deaf people use it to communicate, but many hearing children learn sign language in order to help them with speech. Therefore, having experience and classes in Sign Language will allow me to communicate with the children I hope to help someday. Volunteering at hospitals and Vlaanderens Bedevaarten has given me an insatiable need to help people. Every time I leave the hospital from volunteering, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and joy that cannot be had elsewhere. I will always remember the 91-year old man that I kept company at Vlaanderens Bedevaarten who did not take 'pills' but 'vitamins' and wanted to make sure I knew the difference. Just thinking about him coming towards me with his walker, dancing along the way, still has me smiling. I strive to become a physician so that I can help countless others while at the same time feeding my curiosity of the human body.  \tReaching the top of the mountain and becoming a physician will also help me achieve my goal of participating in Doctors without Borders--or as I first heard it, Mdecins sans frontires. My aunt introduced me to this organization after she participated in a mission trip, and I have looked forward to an opportunity to volunteer myself ever since. One of the predominant places that Doctors without Borders is situation is in Africa where many people understand some French. For that reason, I chose to minor in French, knowing that communicating to patients in their own language will make the process easier for us both, and I would be able to comfort and reassure the patients much more easily. Becoming involved with Mdecins sans frontires would satiate my need for adventure by combining my interest in traveling abroad and medicine.  I have had the opportunity to travel to many places within the United States and several countries within Europe so I have acquired a great appreciation for other cultures and a passion for seeing them firsthand.  For example, when living in Belgium, we would go to Switzerland each year as a family to go hiking in the mountains. I looked forward to these vacations every year so that I could spend time with my family, and I loved the sense of accomplishment I felt every time I reached a cabin. The challenges I faced during the hike, the ups and downs of the path and the strong support from my family are what made the climbs so special and rewarding.  \tThe feelings and experiences I have had during my climbs represent the same feelings and experiences found on my journey to becoming a physician. Right now, I am standing on the edge of the glacier, looking across the long landscape of medical school and the rewards on the far side. I am ready to take that first step onto that hard glacier ice. Volunteering in the nursery and escorting patients After my freshman year, I volunteered twice a week at the Kettering Medical Center. On Tuesdays, I helped out in the nursery, stocking cribs and running errands; I loved this part because seeing the newborns was heart-warming, and it was exciting for me to think that I might be able to work with them in the future. On Thursdays, I helped out in the discharge office by escorting patients to other areas in the hospital or out to their car. It was especially fun for me to see the newborns on Tuesdays, and then be able to escort the new mother and baby out on Thursdays. I loved seeing the first-time parents holding their baby and seeing the joy radiating from their faces., AMSA (American Medical Student Association) AMSA is a medical society that holds bimonthly meetings in which various doctors are brought to campus to talk about their specific aspect of this broad profession. The topic of discussion can vary from their experiences in medical school and residency to their toughest cases so far in their career. Listening to these lectures has been very educational for me to really see the multitude of options out there in the medical field and confirmed my hope of becoming a physician. This club also incorporates community service opportunities from writing Valentine's Day cards for the elderly and children to Relay for Life., Volunteer Counselor at a Deaf Camp Deaf camp varied from one to two weeks in the summer where I volunteered as a counselor. This was a day camp for children who are deaf or who have relatives that are deaf, so being a counselor was a great opportunity to put my sign language into practice. In the morning, I helped the children with their crafts and oversaw them when they went outside to play. In the afternoon, I helped make sure the kids were where they were supposed to be, and I also translated for the children when they wanted snacks. I loved getting to know all of those children, and this experience has reinforced my hope of becoming a pediatrician., Volunteering in the ER and Inpatient Care I volunteer at McCulough-hyde Memorial Hospital and I absolutely love it. I started out at in-patient care, answering the patient's needs and passing around and picking up the meal trays. I then switched departments to the ER where I strip, clean and remake the beds, bring patients to and from x-ray, run specimen down to the lab, and answer patients' needs. I also bring people from the ER to in-patient care, and that has been an interesting experience. Volunteering in both in-patient care and the ER has given me an idea of how the hospital is run and I've thoroughly enjoyed my hospital experiences. It has reinforced my hope of working in a hospital someday., Helping the Older Adults I went with a Belgian organization to Lourdes, France on a pilgrimage for a week as a volunteer to the sick. This mostly included the elderly that could no longer walk properly. The main part of the volunteering was to keep the elderly company and to help push their wheelchairs so they could go out into the town.  As part of the pilgrimage, I accompanied groups of elderly patients on several day trips to different churches. I also helped in the kitchen after the elderly finished eating. I had the chance to meet many different older adults, and I enjoyed every minute I spent in their presence., Study Abroad Experience in England In this fully immersive study abroad program, I traveled to the United Kingdom and studied there for one term. I decided to take three biology classes and one psychology classes because they would transfer for my major and because they sounded interesting. Although lighter than my usual schedule, I wanted to take full advantage of this extra time to travel around England. I became comfortable in traveling by myself, whether by train, by plane or taking the Tube throughout London. I also took full advantage of the extra-curricular activities the school offered, and made sure to explore the small town of Egham., MiamiMed Miami Med is a society for people interested in the medical profession and holds bimonthly meetings. This club is selective in its membership, and its primary focus is on how to come across as a good applicant. For example, a communications professor came in to talk about the importance of interviews and how to prepare for them. We have also talked about the application process, and where we can find help along the way. The club also brings in doctors to talk about their careers and the medical field, and it offers service activities for interested volunteers. This club has been educational and very helpful in guiding my undergraduate pathway., Working in a Dining Hall Over three semesters, I did various jobs, including working in the dish room and in the dining hall itself. Much of the work dealt with being able to work with others and being able to work efficiently. I met many great people and made friends with people I never would have known without this opportunity. It has also helped teach me the value of money and staying in school. One of the best outcomes from working is that I have learned how to use my time efficiently through needing to manage work in addition to the rigors of school., Shadowing Doctors Since my sophomore year, I have shadowed both Dr Bardy, a gastroenterologist, and Dr Stein, an OB/GYN. I shadowed Dr Bardy for one day and I saw endoscopies and more minor surgeries, including a feeding tube insertion and giving Botox to treat gastroparesis. I shadowed Dr Stein for three consecutive days my sophomore year and then shadowed throughout my second semester junior year to watch deliveries, circumcisions and some surgeries. When I shadowed Dr Stein for the three days, I saw the gynecology part of his job and this side focused more on the patient interaction. I also developed a greater understanding of the administrative part of his job., Working in Dr. Pennock's Lab The lab studied the cilia of Tetrahymena therophila, and my group focused on the swimming speeds of the organism and the affect that different percentages of detain in solution has on it. Videos were taken of the swimming speeds to help analyze the effects of the differing solutions. I enjoyed working in the laboratory so much and I also loved working in a group, because I could do my own experiments but could then meet with my group to see if we got the same results. Working in the laboratory has been very enriching. It has taught me to use different equipment such as the centrifuge and the haemocytometer for counting cells. I will be able to use these skills in medical school and beyond., Honors This selective program provides me with opportunities to take challenging courses outside my major in order to expand my horizons. Honors has also given me the opportunity to go to France to study abroad, which might not have happened otherwise. This program puts its emphasis on reflection and helps me to look back upon my experiences and truly see what I have learned. Honors has been a helpful addition to my education through reflection in determining what pathway I truly want to go into: medicine., Study Abroad Experience in France This six week intensive program was a Miami University workshop to improve my French skills. Combining classes with trips around France gave me the opportunity to practice the language while I was learning it. Trips to Paris and other smaller towns offered me a clearer idea of French culture while showing me its rich history through paintings, architecture, and museums. My favorite class was my art and architecture class, because after studying the paintings, I was able to go to the Louvre and see the actual paintings I just learned about. This summer program gave me a chance to complete my french minor and improve my French skills in a fun and interactive way., Sorority This sorority emphasizes friendship and academia. I joined after meeting some girls that were in the sorority and having the opportunity to meet many girls from different backgrounds and different majors has been very rewarding. Balancing this new sorority with schoolwork has been challenging, but I enjoy it and it has made me feel like a more well-rounded person; I have learned time-management through balancing school with social life. Also, I have been elected the position of scholarship chair for next year where I will be responsible for guiding students who are struggling with classes by helping them to create plans and goals in order to improve grades., Internship and Volunteering at URS Volunteering two days and interning three at United Rehabilitation Services has made this a unique experience. During my volunteering, I have the opportunity to meet and help people with many different types of disabilities ranging from autism to Down syndrome. I enjoy seeing the same people on a consistent basis and building a relationship with them. Having them come say hi and inviting me to eat lunch with them has been special for me. The internship has been spent shadowing job coaches and meeting people with disabilities who are interested in working but need additional help, from accessing whether they are ready to work to helping them with mock interviews, resumes and applications., Volunteering in Oncology While in Belgium, I volunteered at the local hospital in the oncology unit for a month. Some of my time was dedicated to running specimen to and from the lab and making the beds. Most of my time, however, was spent with the patients. I would bring them to the radiology unit, and I helped pass out the lunch meals and the coffee at three, which allowed me to talk to the patients individually. Many patients loved to talk about their childhoods and their families, and I loved to listen. My favorite aspect of the volunteering was having that personal contact and seeing the patients again on the days I was at the hospital. This experience has reassured my hope of working as a doctor in a hospital."

    "text": "My mother fled communist China because she could no longer tolerate the constant pressure from the government as a member of Falun Gong. She brought me to the U.S. when I was seventeen, and no change could have been more dramatic or stressful than leaving everything I knew behind to start a new life in a new country. Yet, while I was still struggling to adapt to my new home in the U.S., Mom became disabled due to pemphigus-a rare, potentially deadly autoimmune disease. With no one else to depend on, I became the head of the family-working, making financial decisions, applying to government aid programs, and co-signing important documents, all while learning English.  During this difficult time, Mom and I were lucky to meet Dr. Tracie Tavel. Despite a busy practice, Dr.Tavel stopped by our home every morning to check on Mom before going into clinic. There is no question in my mind that Dr.Tavel saved my mom's life with her medical skills, kindness, and, more importantly her empathy and compassion. Dr.Tavel's humanity and excellence imbued me with respect, and fired my interest in becoming a physician.  Since my contact with Dr. Tavel, I've developed a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a physician, and my experiences as a student, researcher, patient, and health care worker, have shown me what it takes to be a successful one. Given my mother's disability and our financial situation, I knew that I wouldn't be able to afford a four-year university. Therefore, I enrolled at a local community college. During my freshman year, I struggled to choose a major:  Should I major in business and start providing for my family as soon as possible, or should I follow my passion for the life sciences into a career in medicine that would require financial and personal sacrifices over the long term I followed my heart, and chose to focus on the sciences.   I distinguished myself well enough in community college to earn a transfer to UC Berkeley, where I continued my work in the life sciences.  As a senior, I researched how genetic information can be used to infer evolutionary relationships by developing genetic markers to test a phylogenetic hypothesis for genus Heliconia. Getting the desired DNA bands was at times frustrating and difficult, leading to long days in the lab. However, when I eventually succeeded, I realized that the end goal made all the effort worth it.   Unfortunately, during my junior year, I injured my coccyx in a snowboarding accident. The first doctor I saw refused to believe any of my complaints or comments about the injury and shot down my requests for an X-Ray. I felt frustrated until switching to another physician, Dr. Chang, who actually listened to me and reached the right diagnosis. Yet, my rectum correction failed because we missed the best time for treatment. Through this experience, it made clear to me that listening and reciprocal trust in a doctor-patient relationship is vital to health care outcome.   After my recovery, I focused all of my energy on pursuing a career in medicine. I volunteered at various clinical settings in order to gain exposure to and experience in the skills I would need as a physician.  For example, I volunteered at the Children's Hospital of Oakland where I worked as a clerical assistant. Here, the pain and suffering of others reminded me of my own experiences as a patient and caregiver, and of what an illness or injury means to a patient and a family. As a doctor, I would want to work towards easing my patients' emotional and financial stress under such circumstances.  Later, my work as a bilingual diabetes educator taught me the importance of having a patient-centered practice. My patients often had trouble following complicated nutritional texts and leaflets. In order to better meet their needs, I decided to provide them with more visual, user-friendly information. The result was a hands-on Asian-centered curriculum for cooking to help better control patients' diabetes.  I was thrilled when their follow-up tests revealed lowered A1C hemoglobin levels. This instant gratification reminded me of my career goal- I would enjoy helping others find what works best for them.   Why do I want to become a physician My mother's illness and disability taught me responsibility and just how important health is to an individual and family. Dr.Tavel's compassion showed me what a difference a caring, competent physician can make in a patient's life.  As an immigrant from a modest background, I've learned the value of hard work and perseverance.  I don't quail at the idea of delayed gratification, or at the prospect of being a student for many years to come! As the first member of my family to graduate from college, I've learned to cherish education and what it can bring. Research has taught me critical thinking, patience and the need for incorporating current finding in searching for best solutions. As a patient following my snowboarding accident, I developed a medical consumer's perspective. My work as a volunteer and diabetes educator taught me to value empathy and my cultural competency in two worlds. These qualities, plus medical education and training, would help me to become a fine physician of whom both my mother and Dr.Tavel would be proud. Hospital Volunteer & Shadowing Children's Hospital Oakland serves the low-income and minorities members in its community. As a clerical assistant at the Medical Genetic Department, I assisted in administrative work and greeted patients upon their visits. My responsibilities included setting up appointments, inputting patients' data into our system and creating organizing patient files.,  FRONT DESK, Departmental Citation Award & Honors & Scholarships I graduated from UC Berkeley with high honors and was on the Dean's List for all the semesters I attended. In 2010, I won Departmental Citation Award, which is awarded to only one top graduating senior every year by the Department of Plant and Microbiology, in recognition of distinguished undergraduate work. I was also awarded various scholarships throughout all my undergraduate years, including Berkeley Academic Scholarships, FODARA Merit Scholarships, EOPS Transfer Scholarship, Kiwanis Club Scholarship and MVLA Scholarship, etc. It was also a honor to present my research findings in Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) in 2010., Diabetes Self-Management Educator I learned that emotional support and education could help patients nurture a good attitude in their battle with diseases. In classes, I led small groups in practicing positive thinking and other coping skills, when facing their diseases. Along the way, I realized that each patient was unique and special. No matter who they were, I always listened to them and treated them with respect. From them, I learned that while medications were essential to control their conditions, more importantly, patients needed empathy. With this lesson in mind, I look forward to build caring relationships with the future patients., Prospective math teacher I worked as a prospective math teacher serving middle school students who are from low-income Latino and African American families. I taught them Algebra II. Designing fun class curriculum that was engaging and educational for these students was rewarding. I learned that a teacher's patience and clear directions could have a great impact on students' academic performance. I enjoyed watching my students as their faces glow and their eyes bulge with excitement as confusion turns into comprehension. As part of the program, I went to a one-day university tour with my students. I shared my college experience and hoped to motivate them to pursue higher college education., Shadowing Family Practice In the past three months, I've spent about 100 hours shadowing a Family Physician, Dr. Wu, at the Bay Valley Medical Group.  Since the medical group was affiliated with St. Rose Hospital, I also had opportunities to follow the physician to admit, discharge or visit patients in the hospital. This shadowing experience was very enlightening. It gave me a better understanding of what it was like to be a physician and I was also fascinated by the clinical cases I saw., Research Internship My internship took place in a lab that studied the signal transduction pathways and gene regulation networks controlling plant development. I worked on a project with a post-doc at studying the role of Brassinosteroid (BR) in regulating branching using plant model Arabidopsis. Taking good care of plants was also vital to the success of the experiment.  It required attention to details when working with small plants. I was fascinated by genetics and have learned that scientific research is an ongoing process to discover new knowledge and solutions. I also gained some hands on experience in advanced biotechnologies including the fluorescent tagging and microarray., Private Tutor Over the past six years, I've been working as a private tutor for many different families. My areas of focuses were sciences and Chinese language. I tutored students ranging from second graders to high school seniors. The tutoring sessions took place in a one-on-one setting at students' home where I strove to provide my students with enriched educational experience., Undergraduate honors research project/ Senior thesis The honors program gave me a great opportunity to have a well-rounded understanding of research. My senior thesis was using genetic markers to develop a phylogenetic hypothesis for genus Heliconia (Family Zingiberales). In this experience, I participated in the whole research process, from initiating my own topic, performing literature research, generating hypotheses, designing methodology to trouble shooting during experiment for analyzing my results. I also worked closely with other members in the team. After having preliminary results, I presented my findings in Honors Symposium. In addition, medical uses of some plants in Zingiberales family inspired me to study ethnobotany., Wildlife Rescue Assistant The wildlife rescue center is crowded with orphaned animals that people find in the wild. My main responsibilities were feeding, stocking cages, monitoring for and reporting changes and assisting with special food preparation. One of the frustrations that I experienced the most was the fact that some sick animals couldn't survive regardless of how meticulous the care I gave. Throughout the year, I obtained hands on experience in witnessing the cycle of life amongst different animals and it was also my first experience with emergency care. This experience made it even clearer to me that each and every life is precious and worth saving regardless of it being a wild animal or a human being., Public Library Volunteer This was my first volunteer experience, and I was surprised that I felt so rewarded just by helping a little toddler get a children's book. Although my main responsibility was sorting DVDs and books, I had the chance to help people find what they needed through direct interactions. Throughout a year, I became more aware of people's needs and developed more efficient ways of helping the patrons individually.  I also got more familiar with the library operations and the logic behind call No., Teaching Assistant While attending Foothill College, I worked as an accounting teaching assistant for two years. My main responsibilities were keeping track of over 400 students' records and grading works. I exercised my judgment calls through this job. I needed to explain to students the reasoning behind my grading. I also learned a great deal of interpersonal skills and professional manners from observing the professor's interactions with people. Lastly, I was able to utilize what I learned by training new assistants for the professor. I believe that the interpersonal skills and the better judgments I gained from this experience will be useful when treating my future patients."

    "text": "Eleni, I'm sick. Why am I sick Autism prevented David from being able to understand the pain he was in. He was vulnerable, confused, and extremely uncomfortable. I wanted to make him feel better, and if possible, help him understand just a little of what had happened to him.  I felt inadequate as I held the ice packs up to his swollen cheeks and explained for the fourth time that he had his wisdom teeth removed. Oh yeah. I got my wisdom teeth out, Eleni! was his response and he was soothed for the moment, but his autism would make him forget, and he would ask again shortly.       Explaining how to rinse with salt water without swallowing was a bit of a challenge. After demonstrating repeatedly, and practicing with tap water, I was able to get David to cleanse the stitches deep in his cheeks.  A small victory this time, but it wouldn't last and I longed for tomorrow, or the next day, when I knew he would begin to feel better. Then I could exhale my tension, frustration, and sympathy for him.       I stumbled upon the opportunity to be a personal aide for David during my junior year. The chance to work with someone with special needs intrigued me, but I had little experience caring for kids, and no experience working with a young man with autism. I pushed aside my insecurities and called about the job. Working with David was a real-life experience outside of the college bubble. I was pulled out of a world where my main concern was my grades, and given the responsibility of caring for another human being.       I quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing, and no one could teach me how to relate to David except me.  I felt an enormous amount of pressure and fear that if I messed up, I could hurt a person who could not protect himself.  I knew I was unqualified for the job, and I felt quite anxious for a number of weeks before and after my shifts with David. I never knew if I was pushing him enough during swim practice, what I should make him for dinner, or if I should let him have another diet coke, which he always wanted. If he had a breakdown in public, I did not know how to calm him down and whether or not I needed to take him home. I sprinted up and down the bleachers at his high school football games because I did not want to loose sight of him as he rushed around talking to people, unable to sit still.       I am proud of myself for persevering, as well as learning how to make a connection with someone who is extremely difficult to connect with. As we spent more time together, we slowly got to know each other. I began to realize that he could swim a lot farther with the proper motivation, and he would deny having math homework unless I checked his book bag. More importantly, he began to show me that he considered me a friend.  A year and a half later, when he was calling me over and over to find out what time I would arrive at his graduation party, and I could barely contain my pride for his achievements, I realized how deep our friendship had become. I am no longer nervous when I spend time with David, and I am able to enjoy being with him. I can laugh at his antics and guide him to better behavior without wanting to disappear from embarrassment. Looking back, I chuckle at my anxiety over losing him at a football game. Now, when I drive him to his social events, I am able to keep my distance, and he comes to me when he needs help with anything. I am proud to be a part of his life and to be someone he has come to trust and rely on.       Although I entered college as a pre-med student, I questioned that career choice often. One reason for this was my interest in many different subjects and professions. I changed my major multiple times, and I considered many other career paths. I love the sciences, the humanities, traveling, languages, and cultures.  I now realize that these interests have made me a well-rounded person, capable of relating well to other people. Another reason for my uncertainty was the sacrifices that a career in medicine requires. It's one thing to have a wide variety of interests, but would I have time to pursue any of them Working with David while balancing a full school schedule, volunteering, and having a social life, has taught me time management skills and the importance of harmonizing my career with my personal life.        Becoming a part of David's life has helped me realize that medicine is the only career for me. Helping David to become a more independent individual over the years has been a challenging, educational, emotional, and fulfilling experience. There have been other enlightening moments in my life, that if I had pieced them all together sooner, I would have pursued a career in medicine much earlier in college.  However, being a late bloomer, while frustrating at the time, has led me to a solid, committed decision.  I think that my interest in a wide variety of subjects has caused me to circle around many different career choices. Yet, as I reflect on certain moments in my life, such as working with David, I realize that the combination of having a love for the biological sciences, an interest in teaching, a fascination with the human body and a deep, internal pull to help people, has made medicine a natural choice for me.  Aide for child with autism, BuckeyeThon Dance Marathon Buckeyethon is a 12-hour dance marathon that raises money for NationWide Children's Hospital. As a dancer, I raised over $200 the first two years. I decided to get more involved, and I was invited to join the Dancer Fundraising Committee. I helped organize Miracle Meals and Neighborhood Canning, two fundraising events that raised approximately $1000. As a committee member, I attended weekly 2 hour meetings to plan for the dance marathon. The third year as a dancer, I personally raised over $600 dollars. My final year, I was chosen to be part of Dancer Fundraising again and coordinate Miracle Meals and Bar Fundraisers. I raised my goal of $2,100, and donated my hair on stage to Wigs for Kid., Deans List I have made the Dean's List for eleven out of the twelve quarters since I have been a student at Ohio State. I enjoy learning and performing well academically, which motivated me to continue to make the Dean's list during my last semester of college., Lorain Cleveland Clinic Summer Internship I participated in the Lorain Cleveland Clinic internship during the summers of 2008 and 2011. During the first summer, I spent the majority of my time in the ophthalmology office running ancillary tests on patients, escorting patients to rooms, and filing. I shadowed physicians in the cardiology, internal medicine, geriatrics, pediatrics, and surgery departments weekly throughout the second summer. Interns were assigned weekly journal readings and had to give presentations in front of guest doctors., Honors Program I qualified for the Honors Program at Ohio Sate because of my performance on the ACT and my high school grade point average. The smaller class sizes provided by the honors program allowed me to have increased one on one time with my professors and an overall better academic experience. The honors classes were more challenging, and I learned more in those classes than in my large lectures. I will be graduating with honors distinction because I maintained a higher gpa than the required 3.2 throughout my college career., Provost Scholarship I received the Ohio State Provost Scholarship of $700 dollars per quarter for four years because of my ACT score and high school grade point average. I maintained my scholarship throughout my college career because I kept my grade point average above a 3.2., Alternative Spring Break I spent my spring break sampling various service opportunities around Columbus. My volunteer group helped sort meat at local food shelter, and we organized merchandise at a Habitat for Humanity warehouse. Midweek, we visited an aides shelter and learned about the prejudices aides victims face daily. On the last day, we delivered dinners to locals who were unable to leave their homes due to illness. Some of the recipients on the delivery route expressed feeling extremely sad, lonely, and helpless. This intimate perspective into the lives of others within my own community brought to my attention hardships that I had never previously been exposed to., Medical Mission International General Helper I spent one week out of the summer in Las Matas de Farfan, an impoverished city in the Dominican Republic. During that week, I woke up and joined the rest of the volunteers on the bus to the hospital at 7:30 a.m. I spent the first day unloading and sterilizing instruments. The majority of my time was spent in the sterilizing room, cleaning and organizing instruments. In the afternoons, I helped the nurses take patients' blood pressures and weights. The surgeon allowed me to observe surgeries, and I was able to witness three natural births, two caesarian sections, one tubectomy, one hernia repair, and a hydrocelectomy. We left the hospital for home by approximately 8:00 p.m., Brenen's Cafe Employee I was originally hired at Brenen's Cafe as summer help, but I was offered a position for next fall as well. I began working as a cashier, but after two weeks I was trained as a cook and barista as well. I took on morning shifts, which involved prepping food for the day and cleaning. Throughout the morning, I had to multitask as cashier, barista, and cook, as well as complete the morning prep work. The most challenging part of the job was during a morning rush. I learned how to be quick and efficient while still ensuring customer satisfaction., Aide for child with autism I worked with a child with autism for two years while I was at Ohio State. I was responsible for helping him with academic and extra- curricular activities. During the school year, I picked him up from school, and tutored him in reading and math. Afterwards, I drove him to swim team and helped him through practice. In the evening, we prepared dinner together. Throughout the year, I drove him to swim meets, sporting events, piano lessons, and other activities. I also planned educational activities such as making a grocery list and going grocery shopping, or going to the zoo. I monitored him at social events to ensure his safety and to make sure he was socializing maturely., Coed Soccer Intramural soccer has been a fun and competitive activity of mine for ten quarters of my undergraduate career. I was co-captain for three quarters, during which I organized and signed up my own team. Each season contained three to four games before tournament style games. Playing soccer is one of my favorite activities, and I enjoyed being a part of a team. I also played weekly pick-up games in order to stay active and healthy.,  MCAT Instructor, Turkish Language My grandparents and my father speak Turkish, so  learning turkish was important to me in order to connect to my ethnic roots. Joining the Turkish Student Association gave me the opportunity to practice speaking Turkish and participate in cultural activities. The club hosted picnics, game nights, movies, soccer tournaments, and celebrated Turkish holidays. In order to help me practice Turkish on a regular basis, the club set me up with a Turkish conversation partner, whom I met once a week. Connecting with my ethnicity has been fulfilling. I know more about myself and I am able to relate to my Turkish relatives at a deeper level., The Olive Scene seasonal employee My mom opened an olive oil and balsamic vinegar store two years ago so I helped out at the store whenever I am home from school. My main task was wiping down merchandise and displaying cabinets before the store opens. During store hours, I greeted customers and led them on an olive oil tasting tour of the store. I also worked as a cashier, gift wrapper, and gift basket maker. After the store closes for the evening, I helped restock the merchandise. Working with customers improved my communication skills and my ability to make people feel comfortable when they enter the store. I enjoyed the opportunity to teach about the origin of olives and interact with customers., Summer in Turkey Studying in Turkey was a goal of mine because I wanted experience the culture firsthand, and I wanted to meet my extended family who live in Istanbul. I applied as a summer exchange student to the Bogazici University. I was accepted, however, upon my arrival, I found the program to be very disorganized. The only Turkish language class that was offered was above my level. However, I learned the by exploring the city and conversing with taxi drivers, waiters, and other locals. Meeting my family for the first time felt more like a reunion. We communicate regularly and I cannot wait to see them again. I often think about the wonderful time I had in Turkey., Labre Homeless Ministry The mission of Labre is to offer food and ministry to the homeless around Columbus. The first time I went on a mission, I was nervous and I had no idea what to expect. After preparing food and packing up the van, our group of five set out into the snow. At every stop, we delivered food and chatted for a little while. Before leaving for the next stop, we formed a circle and expressed something we were thankful for. Labre gave names and faces to people who I had previously categorized as homeless. By getting to know the people we ministered to, I learned that this population of people is often misrepresented in our society., Office Assistant Working at the front desk of my residence hall had many advantages and only one disadvantage. My tasks included checking residents in and out at the beginning and end of the quarter, mailing campus letters, and helping residents with general questions. After finishing those tasks, I could spend my time studying, which allowed me to pick up more hours than I usually would and still balance my course load. The job was also great because I got to know the staff and residents. A difficult part of the job was the abnormal hours. I worked day and night shifts as well as holiday shifts. Even still, I enjoyed the responsibility supervising the front desk throughout the night."

    "text": "When I was eleven years old, my father began getting sick. At first our family doctor dismissed it and signed a few prescriptions. Yet as the weeks went on, my family saw how serious his condition was--yellowing skin, fatigue, and he could barely keep food down. When we finally checked him into the hospital, the Cleveland Clinic doctors delivered the terrible news: he had an advanced case of autoimmune hepatitis. His liver was shutting down. The only viable solution was an organ donation. But we were just a suburban family from Ohio; what did we know of transplants or surgery All we really knew was that my dad's time was dwindling, his side of the family was backing out, and he was too far down the transplant list.  Enter my Uncle Jim. With tattoos covering his arms, a ponytail down to his waist, and a host of motorcycles in his garage, he was already my most extraordinary family member. But when he heard of my father's condition, there was no hesitation. He agreed to a live donation to his sister's husband, a man he was not even truly related to. I can only imagine the courage he had throughout the process; he was perfectly healthy and yet there was a chance he might not survive the operation. Before we knew it, though, they were both wheeled out of the surgery room. The transplant had gone smoothly, and now, over ten years later, our family is still together.  As time has passed, I have been able to meditate on how my father's sickness and near-miracle recovery have played a central role in my life. Both the doctors involved and my uncle demonstrate how, at some point in life, everyone is capable of improving the lives of others in their own way. The determination of my father's doctors kept him alive, despite his deteriorating condition. And, when everyone else had refused, my Uncle Jim stepped up and saved a life without a second's hesitation. The result: the tenth live, adult-to-adult liver transplant in Cleveland Clinic history. I tell this story because it depicts why I wish to enter medical school--social responsibility.  To me, the concept of social responsibility means making all possible effort and sacrifice to serve others in a capacity made possible by innate abilities. Look at the cast of my story. With their natural intellect and years of education and experience, the Clinic physicians knew it was their duty to attempt the transplant. Likewise, my uncle saw his family's suffering and immediately acknowledged the role he needed to play to alleviate it. With this guiding principle in mind, I have tried to challenge myself at every possible moment and hold myself to the highest standards. The goal has been to prepare myself for my future social responsibilities. I became an Honors student and maintained an engaging schedule each quarter. The Honors program has surrounded me with other intelligent, competitive students who also aspire to put their talents to work for others. I then chose Biochemistry as a major because I wanted the challenge of covering two vital areas in one degree. And, due to the high expectations of my major, I have certainly learned the value of hard work and sacrifice.  At the same time, I have found the drive within myself to become a strong leader outside of the classroom. Whether it is executive board positions, retreats, or my employment, I constantly strive to be a positive role model and work for the benefit of others. I have served as a mentor for cohorts of first-years, organized bank accounts, coordinated a charity dance for the James Cancer Hospital, and even volunteered to educate numerous groups around campus about leadership theory. Each experience taught me more about myself and my style of leadership. It has all been in preparation--going to medical school means becoming a lifelong leader. Just like my father's physicians and my Uncle Jim, it is my duty to take the initiative in assisting my peers. They all had the knowledge and skills or the will to help, and they put them to use for their fellow man. I know I have the skill and can strive for excellence; it is my responsibility to work my hardest to enter and succeed in medical school and serve the world.  Serving the world may seem idealistic, but should I gain entrance into medical school, I will be one large step closer to achieving my dream: starting a non-profit, medical organization. The focus of this group would be teaching under-privileged people worldwide about cleaning and binding wounds, setting broken bones, and other basic measures, so that more people can be saved from preventable deaths. After witnessing tragedies like Hurricane Katrina, the earthquake in Haiti, and the tsunami in Japan, I believe my dream has the potential to make a lasting impact. Founding this organization is my social responsibility and I will work and sacrifice all I can to make it a reality. Medical school will build upon my already strong background in science, leadership, and service, and produce a driven physician and entrepreneur. After all, with role models like my Uncle Jim and the Cleveland Clinic doctors, and the preparation of medical school, I know can save lives and keep families together. Mirrors Sophomore Class Honorary Member After an extensive application and interview process, I was accepted into this class honorary as one of the most competitive sophomores at The Ohio State University, as judged under the standards of leadership, scholarship, and service. The mission of Mirrors Honorary is to serve the James Cancer Hospital; we organized a formal dance for students that raised over $3,000. Also, I served in the office of AOSCH representative. AOSCH is a committee comprised of members of each class honorary and we strove to create a cooperative, cohesive environment between the groups. I will always value Mirrors for teaching me that even sophomores, when working together, can be agents of positive change., Intern in Heart Failure Research As an intern at the Cleveland Clinic, I worked within the department of Heart Failure Research. I worked alongside numerous research nurses, as well as many respected cardiologists, in their various studies. After completing the CITI training process for human research subjects, my main project was the organization of the Cardiac Transplant Research Database (CTRD). This included reviewing the charts of past heart transplant recipients and documenting their pathologies. In addition, the nurses introduced me to many heart procedures including electrocardiograms, various blood tests, echocardiograms, catherizations, and even an open-heart surgery involving a bypass and an artificial valve., Semester Transition Committee, Student Member As one of the few students in the College of Arts and Sciences chosen for this committee, it was my responsibility to provide a unique perspective on The Ohio State University's switch from the quarter system to the semester system. Bi-quarterly meetings of faculty, staff, and student members addressed the remaining transition issues specific to the Honors and Scholars programs; topics included research requirements, general education courses, non-tenured professors, and more. Being a part of the committee showed me the extensive thought and planning necessary for a project of this magnitude. I was so honored to have a role in a process that will impact generations of students to come., Service Trip to the Guadalupe Center Buck-i-Serv, the largest student-run service group at Ohio State, facilitates trips to different service locations across the country each academic break. I served as co-leader for the trip to Immokalee, Florida, where our group worked with local migrant workers. We met with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), entertained the children of low-income families at the local daycare, and stayed in the town's homeless shelter. My responsibilities as co-leader were to coordinate the schedule and budget, and share the hours of driving. The entire experience was truly eye-opening; toiling to improve the harsh conditions of the less fortunate made me wish I had more time to spend in Immokalee., National Merit Finalist Scholar Due to exceptional performance on the PSAT during my junior year of high school and the following application, I was designated a National Merit Finalist. The Ohio State University recognized that accomplishment in the form of this merit-based scholarship. The requirements are parallel with those involved in maintaining my status as an Honors student: keep a GPA at or above 3.40, schedule a competitive class load that includes a number of Honors-level classes, and consider extra-curricular research. The award covers the full cost of tuition, a value of approximately $9,000 per year, and has allowed me to attend Ohio State without putting serious financial pressure on my family or myself., Ohio State Yoga Club During my time at Ohio State, my involvement in Yoga Club has elevated from member, to two-year Treasurer, to Executive Vice President. Since learning the basics of yoga in high school, I have been passionate about spreading the workout to as many people as possible. This sport club has practices three times a week, in addition to executive board meetings once a quarter. I have also had the opportunity to begin teaching in a basic vinyasa style. My responsibilities have included balancing the budget, scheduling and paying teachers, and coordinating social events. Hopefully in the future I can become a licensed instructor and continue learning about myself and the practice of yoga., Orientation Leader Each summer Ohio State welcomes every incoming first-year to campus for a two-day Orientation program. Each student is assigned an Orientation Leader--a current student who coordinates the activities and serves as an immediate resource for students and families alike. Responsibilities included campus tours, facilitating discussions within small groups, assisting with class scheduling, and much more. In addition, weekly staff meetings and supervisor one-on-ones were required. Due to the nature of the job, constantly being visible to families  improved my professionalism, public speaking, and people skills. The true pleasure, though, was working with 23 other amazing student staff members., Office Assistant, Administration Office For over two years I have provided quality customer service at the Administration desk of The Ohio Union. As soon as the new building opened, I began working with Event Services to facilitate space requests, catering food orders, building tours, invoice payments, and more. Additionally, working within Student Life has allowed me to learn about opportunities like leadership and service programs and campus events. The position has taught me the meaning of professionalism, diversity, and confidentiality through the spectrum of staff and customers with whom I have worked. Lastly, the job has given me my two closest mentors and many lasting friendships, for which I will always be grateful., Student Leadership Advocates Student Leadership Advocates is a university cohort that provides leadership resources for student organizations throughout campus. Our main focus is facilitating discussions, retreats, and other trainings so that our fellow students can foster strong leadership practices. Through weekly meetings, we review the many facilitation requests for the quarter and learn new techniques or inventories. Since joining SLA, I have developed a unique style of presenting information and have successfully held many discussions between my peers. I have also facilitated at two of Ohio's State's largest leadership programs, the Conference on Leadership and Civic Engagement and the Student Organization Summit.,  Student Research Assistant, LeaderShape OSU The LeaderShape Institute is a nationally acclaimed leadership program that runs corporate, private, and campus-based retreats. The Ohio State University branch of LeaderShape has been around for over 10 years and I have been involved with it since attending in Summer 2010. Over the course of six days, a group of Ohio State students learn what it means to lead with integrity, disregard the impossible, and discover their vision of an ideal world. With trained lead facilitators provided by the institute, and small group facilitators from Ohio State, the program is carefully designed to create a constructive atmosphere for students to plan their own ways of becoming agents for positive change., Research Assistant in HIV Transmission The primary focus of Kwiek Lab, within Ohio State University Medical Center, is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Many projects have been underway since I started assisting in this lab, all geared towards inhibiting the transmission or reproductive mechanisms of the virus. Working in Kwiek Lab has vastly improved my benchwork, taught me the value of patience and determination, and broadened my appreciation for the hard work and creativity required of researchers. Lastly, I have recently started my own project based on investigating potential drug compounds that may target the viral enzyme integrase. My hope is to someday publish the information that I glean from integrase and HIV., First Year Leadership Initiative The primary goal of First Year Leadership Initiative is to introduce young students to student clubs and resources and educate them on the benefits and opportunities that come from getting involved around campus. As a member, this organization provided the means for me to delve into my extracurricular interests, like leadership studies. As an executive member for two years, I helped oversee the weekly board and member meetings, and acted as a mentor for a number of participants. The people of this club became my family, I discovered many valuable facets of my university, and graduates of the program are now ubiquitous around campus; the club has become a staple among first-year programs., Excellence In Scholarship This award is presented to students within the College of Arts and Sciences once a year during Spring Quarter. Only 151 students in this college received the award this year, 56 were within the division of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, and I was one of six Biochemistry majors who were chosen for this prestigious honor. The award is given to students who demonstrate superior performance in the pursuit of knowledge, in addition to striving for local and global understanding. The college offers it as recognition for the industry, dedication, and imagination of its top students in the areas of scholarship, leadership, and research., University Host This University Admissions and First Year Experience program has the responsibility of managing families before their Ohio State campus tour begins. The expectations of Hosting includes multiple program meetings throughout the year for all members and volunteer shifts every week. Duties during those shifts range from seating the families to actively engaging them in conversation about our college. Hosting has greatly improved my already strong people skills and confidence in approaching new people. I have enjoyed the program so much that I recently applied for and was hired as the Host Captain, a paid student staff position responsible for scheduling, training, and other management duties.,  University Host Captain (Coordinator)"

    "text": "There is a struggle that takes place in all of us in which we must ascertain our drive in life. Some people are unlucky in that they live their whole lifetimes without ever envisioning their purpose. Despite being debilitated with severe asthma and eczema during my childhood I was only fortunate to realize I had the desire to pursue medicine during the most malleable period of my life, adolescence. My younger brother and I had engaged in a commonplace altercation that occurs between siblings. However, this event was atypical in that it concluded in my brother's superior incisor being chipped and myself sustaining a lacerated tendon that required surgical measures. It was through this random chance incident when I first discovered the desire to pursue medicine as a career. Throughout my life I have been socially reclusive in that I continually experience difficulties when attempting to connect with people. Growing up in a crime stricken area like Lincoln Heights, a social shortcoming like not being sociable oddly played in my favor. It provided me with the outlet to develop in areas that my peers didn't, namely education, a subject in which they loathed. In this case, what many would call my weakness was the path to my salvation. I am motivated to study medicine because there is no better way to connect with people than when you can change or even better, saving their life. Disease, pain, and suffering are facets of life that no one is a stranger to. These themes are all apart of the human experience. When choosing a discipline as a career, one might contemplate the importance of aspects as difficulty, intrigue, and relevance to society in their choice. I am certain, from what I have observed and experienced, that the study of medicine provides all these needs. While I never viewed the subjects of my studies as being insipid, the sciences, most importantly the applications of the sciences have been the most fascinating to learn. I am awestricken of medicine's practical application of the sciences in treating human disease. There is no other discipline of study that has transformed every facet of our lives to the extent that we live longer, happier, and more vibrant lives. Many people claim that doctors are uncongenial people, but I believe that if given the opportunity I would shatter this stereotype. I have been told that cleverness isn't the most significant skill in a successful career as a physician; nevertheless success relies on an amalgamation of assets including various social factors. I am resolute that I can achieve these standards, albeit my GPA might suggest otherwise due to it being lower than the most competitive applicants. I began my college career early during my senior year of high school. Looking back, I was a little overzealous in that I was determined to get a jump-start on my college career. When I moved out my sophomore year, I struggled to finance my studies having to pay for a large part of my education and living expenses by working several part time jobs while simultaneously dealing with an 18-credit hour coarse load. However, in the summer of my sophomore year I found my niche. I would no longer accept my mediocre academic performance. I would like the admissions committee to take into account the grade trend as seen in my junior year and the prior summer term, relative to my first two years in college. I believe that my triumph in finally attaining an outstanding level of academic achievement while still working two part time jobs conveys volumes about my tolerance for rigorous work. This monumental achievement parallels my consistent defiance of the conventions set by many of my cohorts in my socio-economic class. I have overcame many challenges in my life, the same set of obstacles have spurned many dismal futures for my fellow members of the African-American community. To the contrary, education has been my outlet much like painting or composing is for an artisan. I believe that my background, similar to many of the people from disparaged areas of which the medical community aids, will allow me to connect with them in ways that supersede the role of doctor, more so along the lines of that of a brother or friend. Undergraduate Research in the Smithrud Group I began conducting undergraduate research in the Smithrud Group during the fall of 2010 and have been a member since then. I had never experienced scientific research firsthand prior to this opportunity. I worked on the syntheses of organic molecules that are derivatized crown ethers that are used in the synthesis of supramolecular molecules called rotaxanes. Working closely with a graduate student, I gained a wealth of knowledge on organic synthetic chemistry and numerous hours of experience with many techniques including H-NMR spectra analysis, column and thin layer chromotographies, and liquid-liquid extractions. This research opportunity granted me valuable tools in scientific research., Working at the Chemistry Stockroom (Main Campus) I began working at the Chemistry Stockroom in the summer of 2010 as a work study appointment and remained employed there until I began my current summer research position. I assisted with the renovations of the undergraduate chemistry labs in the summer and aided/performed the weekly experimental preparation of the undergraduate laboratory courses throughout the year. The latter involved using routine analytical chemistry techniques, sometimes including intermediate methods like titrations for chemical standardizations. Attaining this position during the course of the school year forced me to maximize my study habits and skills. I intend on resuming the position during the upcoming year., ACS Scholars Award I have been selected as one of the recipients of an award targeted toward minorities pursuing further research and graduate studies.  Albeit this is a need-based scholarship, I was nominated for this award as recognition of my various academic achievements as a minority student in my degree program., Working at New Hope Health Care I held a part-time Nurses Aid position at New Hope Health Care. The client base of this company consisted solely of developmentally disabled individuals. My duties included assisting clients in taking their medications, janitorial duties around their homes, and transportation to various functions around their communities. Initially, I found it hard to deal with and effectively communicate with many of the clients, but as time progressed I became deft in understanding them and their struggle in a society who doesn't understand the hardships they endure on a daily basis. This experience exposed me to the stigma that many of the mentally impaired have been given by society., Working at the Genome Research Institute Most recently, I acquired a full-time contractor position in a collaborative project between Drs. Rapoport and Maggio, professors in the Department of Pharmacology at the UC College of Medicine. During my senior year I optimized the synthesis of Bilirubin Oxidation Products (BOXes), but now I am working on an assay to quantify the BOXes in brain tissue samples. What I enjoy most about this position is the unlimited freedom and plethora of resources I am given of how to achieve the desired results as well as the continual exercise in resourcefulness I experience on a daily basis. This position in translational research has been a test of my skills like no other., Shadowing My shadowing of Dr. Wright consisted of viewing several mastectomy surgeries in the operating theater at the Center for Advanced Surgeries of the Albert B. Chandler Hospital. I also attended her pre and post-operative discussions with the families of her patients, thus providing me with experience of the personal side of medicine. I was fortunate to spend several days with not only Dr. Wright, but also several of her colleagues as they traversed through their clinical rounds via attending their patient examinations, differentials, and viewing several outpatient surgical procedures.,  Research Assistant, Cincinnati Flying Pig Marathon Running is a hobby that I began to manage my asthma, a disease I have struggled with all of my life. Since, the commencement of this hobby I have not had an asthma attack in over 6 years. Although I began running regularly in high school, my training for Cincinnati's annual Flying Pig Marathon began November of 2009 along with a fellow chemistry major. This being my first full marathon, I kept with a rigorous training regiment where I would run everyday allowing me ample time to finish my daily studies. My final finish time was 4:08, which is a pretty decent time for an asthmatic. This past spring I completed my second Flying Pig Marathon finishing in 4:07.,  Tax Return Preparation, Working at Michael Harris Electronic Filing This job was my first paid position; conveniently being in the family business of tax-return preparation at a firm ran by my father. After completing an H&R Block course that certified myself in basic tax-return preparation during my junior year of high school. My duties included tax return preparation and light secretarial tasks. Although my father was lenient with my work schedule, the job sometimes would be equivalent to a full time position during the busy part of the tax season concurrently occurring during the later part of the winter quarter, I would be compelled to truly learn the principles of time management., Volunteering at University Hospital To gain more insight into the atmosphere of the hospital I decided to volunteer at the University Hospital Emergency Room. While at the E.R., I most often would escort the families of patients back to the patients and inquire about how I could be of service to the waiting visitors. I observed the stressful environment various doctors would be immersed in for many hours at a time while dealing with uncooperative patients and their families. I also saw some of the grotesque wounds that would pass through the E.R. However I was not turned away by the things I saw, but rather I became more intrigued with medicine from this experience."

Throughout the challenges and adventures in my life, my desire to practice medicine for my career has never wavered.  The lives of my parents and grandparents have impacted my life in meaningful ways. My mother grew up as the oldest child in a family of five; her mother immigrated to America from Italy as a child, while her father was a first-generation Hungarian-American. When my mom was eight, her mother passed away from breast cancer; my mother then took on more responsibility and started working at age 12. She is currently an elementary school guidance counselor and a practicing psychologist. My father, whose parents were both first-generation Hungarian-Americans, began working when he was 14 and is now the owner of a home inspection business. Both of my parents were the first in their families to graduate from college.  I grew up near Youngstown, Ohio, and the majority of my extended family still resides in the region. My oldest brother is a lawyer and a father to two beautiful little girls, while my other brother just received his Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Our parents always instilled in us the values of perseverance and tolerance. My brothers and I were taught and shown that we can achieve great feats if we work hard and stay true to ourselves. In addition, my parents inspired us to respect others and treat them with kindness. Overall, my parents have always been supportive of everything I do, and I consider them friends as well as role models.  Throughout my childhood, I was always fascinated with animals and nature. I was the little girl who strangely enjoyed visiting the doctor and dentist: they knew interesting things and were delightful to talk to. I loved my dance lessons and soccer games, but my dream was to become a doctor. It was while taking high school Anatomy and Physiology that I truly knew in my heart I would one day be a physician, no matter how hard the journey. I began working at age 16 to save up money for college, while still playing the alto saxophone in the school marching and symphonic bands, competing in Speech and Debate tournaments every weekend, and volunteering at the local homeless shelter. Though at the time I simply enjoyed participating in fun, fulfilling activities, I realize now that these enriched my artistic spirit, communication skills, desire to help others, and sense of responsibility.   I first became interested in Johns Hopkins University for its outstanding Biology department and the institution's reputation in research, because it was clear that being a part of a university Biology program was the perfect fit for me. With each passing semester at JHU, I became acquainted with even more extraordinary people, including both peers and instructors, who all further emboldened my interest in science. While I greatly enjoy the laboratory environment, having spent half of my undergraduate career participating in independent research, I have found that my passion for medicine and to work directly with patients burns even more brightly now than it had prior to these first-hand laboratory experiences.  My undergraduate coursework greatly influenced my continuing desire to attend medical school. Two courses in particular stand out to me as having had significant impacts on my interest in medicine: Signaling in Development and Disease, and Developmental Biology. These two courses, along with the rest of my biology and psychology courses at Johns Hopkins, covered a great deal of material; however, even after completing the final exams, I still wanted to learn so much more about the subjects. Signaling in Development and Disease delved into the signaling mechanisms that occur throughout development, as well as the biology of diseases that can arise throughout life due to disruptions in signaling processes in the nervous system and beyond. Developmental Biology, along with the laboratory course, also stands out as having furthered my desire to attend medical school. Learning about how a single cell develops into an entire organism is endlessly fascinating, and there is so much that I learned from this class that transcends the boundaries of the classroom. Each concept we covered contributed to the story of how life unfolds, and how miraculous it is that millions of individual processes can coordinate one overarching goal: to create new life. The laboratory course allowed us to see new life develop before our eyes, teaching us how the details we learned in the lecture course actually come to fruition.  There is no single reason I want to attend medical school; rather, my reasons have built upon one another throughout my lifetime, only increasing my passion each and every day.  To me, nothing could be better than a career that allows me to work directly to help people every day, creating brand new challenges for me to work through, while also involving science and medicine as a central component.  No other field combines science and service in the way that medicine can. I know that becoming a physician is the best career choice for me and that I will be able to contribute greatly to the field. JHU Amnesty International President Amnesty International is a non-governmental grassroots human rights organization that uses peaceful approaches to solve human rights issues.  I was the Freshman Representative of the JHU Chapter from September 2008 to May 2009, Secretary from May 2009 to May 2010, and President from May 2010 to May 2012.  We aimed to spread awareness of various human rights abuses all over the world to the JHU community through monthly events that included speakers, movies, petitions, and more. Some of our campaigns and events involved child soldiers, human trafficking, political prisoners, women's rights, environmental health, the death penalty, and genocide., Laboratory Technician As a laboratory technician, I took on responsibilities in the Wang lab outside of my independent research project.  My duties included making the agar plates used for C. elegans research, which most of the members of the lab take part in, as well as maintaining the lab stock of certain other supplies.  I was also responsible for overseeing our lab's beta testing of a program that tracks C. elegans movements to compute their patterns of motion; I trained my labmates on its use once the testing phase was complete and it was released to the public.  I learned a great deal about teamwork, coordination, and communicating with experts in various fields from multiple institutions., JHU Housing Building Monitor As a student monitor, I assisted students and signed out common room equipment and music practice room keys for their use, as well as managed room reservations and event set-up.  This included keeping a strict inventory of all common areas and equipment, in addition to assisting with audio-visual technology in dorm buildings throughout campus.  Building monitors also serve as a level of security for the buildings.  Through this position, I increased my experience with customer service, as well as gained a greater understanding for audio-visual equipment setup and troubleshooting., Hopkins Hillel Building Monitor and Student Assistant As student assistant, I performed clerical duties such as filing, managing the phone system, and computer documentation. As building monitor, I was responsible for building security by controlling building access, and I also set up for events, maintained general building upkeep, and served as a representative for the organization to those who visited or called.  Along with learning a great deal about a religion different than my own, I gained an even greater understanding for responsibility, patience, and problem solving., Identity Vice President and Co-founder At the end of my freshman year of college, a few friends and I founded Identity with the mission of making the Johns Hopkins community, and the greater community of Baltimore, aware of current national and international issues concerning social injustice.  We aimed to combat common stereotypes regarding race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class, and disability.  I have gained personal enrichment from each event we hosted, and I saw how they all impacted the lives of the people who attended.  In addition, I have learned a great deal about leadership and how to build a successful organization from the ground up., JHU Beta Beta Beta Ntl Biological Honor Society Secretary Beta Beta Beta, also known as Tri-Beta, is a national honor society for undergraduate students.  We fostered a stronger community spirit amongst undergraduate biology majors, provided more opportunities for interaction between biology majors and biology faculty, and enhanced the undergraduate program at Johns Hopkins with various learning opportunities. We did this through a speaker series, student-faculty luncheons, and social and outreach events.  As secretary, I kept track of member attendance and served as a communication liaison for students and faculty, in addition to taking part in general event planning and group leadership responsibilities., Dean's List Dean's List Fall 2008, Spring 2009, and Fall 2010., Independent Undergraduate Research Project, JHMI In the Bumpus lab, I carried out an independent research project to study the signaling pathways involved in the human liver metabolism of Efavirenz, an HIV medication.  I focused on how long-term use of the medication affects cellular signaling processes and often eventually causes liver cell damage.  I learned details about how HIV and viruses affect signaling processes, how the drugs used to treat the viruses can also have specific negative effects, and how certain combinations of medications produce fewer negative effects., Independent Undergraduate Research Project, JHSPH In the Wang lab, I carried out an independent research project in which I isolated and identified mutations that extend the lifespan of the model organism C. elegans using a large-scale screening process.  I analyzed the mutations discovered, working towards identifying details about how these mutants survive longer under conditions of stress (i.e. high temperature.)  In addition to many genetic and biochemical skills, I learned how to organize and implement a long-term, multi-faceted research project., Infocision Communicator, Non-profit division Infocision is a telecommunications agency. The non-profit division has a wide variety of clients, including the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the American Cancer Society, St. Jude Children's Hospital, the American Diabetes Association and more. I contacted past donors and volunteers from these organizations to request them to volunteer once again. In this position, I learned a great deal about handling sensitive topics, as many of the people we contacted had loved ones impacted by disease. I also gained a very real understanding of how many people are impacted by health conditions, either directly or indirectly, and how difficult the conditions are to handle both physically and emotionally.,  Scribe,  Scribe, secretary, Shadowing Neurosurgeon Shadowed Dr. Kohli during patient appointments, including follow-up exams and initial appointments., Caribou Coffee team member Team Member at Caribou Coffee, serving as barista, cashier, and representative for the company., National Society of Collegiate Scholars member/volunteer The National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS) is an invitation-only honor society in which inducted members must have a GPA of 3.4 or above and rank in the top 20 percent of their class.

    "text": "Raising a family of 13 children could not have been easy by any stretch of the imagination, but my grandparents managed the demands of a large family with grace. With 13 sometimes loud and opinionated voices, one can easily imagine the chaos that ensues at our family gatherings. But the trained observer would hear beneath the cacophony, the sounds of a purpose-driven family unit. It is not surprising then, that my family has a mission statement strongly rooted in the legacy of hard work and integrity that my grandparents passed on to us. It is from my family that I have integrated a sense of diligence in my own life philosophy. With such a large family there was never a shortage of people willingly offering encouragement and helping one another. So, in high school when I had to find a professional to shadow I did not have to look far. My cousin invited me to shadow her at the executive offices of a national HMO. To this day she still jokes with me about how I carelessly swept past her office in Operations only to swoon over her colleague Dr.C, who would prove to be invaluable in my decision to pursue a medical career. Dr.C was an African American physician who also served in an administrative capacity. He was my introduction to the intersection of medicine and policy. Because of this encounter I went to college excited to find a way to pursue both science and policy. Before I met Dr.C a career in medicine was desirable, but unfathomable to me. I had grown up in a medically underserved neighborhood where I saw firsthand the culture of distrust and the misconceptions about the healthcare system. The odds of becoming a physician seemed out of reach, however, I felt compelled to help expand access to healthcare and strengthen trust. I learned from my father, who led the neighborhood watch on our street that sometimes you have to stay and fight for the community. This deep and enduring love for community later drove me to pursue a graduate degree in Public Health. Though I had deep admiration for the field of medicine, graduate school forced me to think critically about the profession and seriously explore if being a physician was the right path for me. One such exercise was with my professor Dr.S who opined, The biggest problem facing healthcare is the lack of competent people willing to address healthcare reform. This was the hypothesis he primarily used to promote discussion and examination. I began to realize that I could do my part to help eliminate the systemic healthcare disparities I saw growing up and bring culturally competent care to minority communities. Yet, something still beckoned me toward the personal interaction of a practicing physician that population directed interventions lacked. While working at a children's hospital I was captivated by the provider/patient dynamic. I was astonished how, on an intimate level physicians had an opportunity to positively impact patient care. I can recall working with a family basically living in the NICU because their baby was born with a rare disease. As a clinical research assistant looking to enroll the family in a genetic study, I was unsure how to approach a family about research when they were coping with their daughter's terminal illness. I took cues from the physician who spoke to the family with a sobering tone that recognized the reality of Baby E's condition but with optimism that recognized and respected her life. I soon realized that the family was dealing with her diagnosis by celebrating her life. Simply asking Mom in a positive tone how Baby E was doing that day, brightened her mood. It seemed as if they wanted to maintain some sense of normalcy. By observing the family and provider I was able to maintain a seamless positive environment. The atmosphere along with modern medicine I believe kept Baby E with us for another month. With exposure to different healthcare systems, I was able to clearly see the beauty of direct patient care--building a trusting rapport; explaining to patients how or why their disease may have developed, in a way they could understand. The service orientation of healthcare was evident in these acts of kindness. Witnessing physicians provide exceptional care reminded me of my chance encounter with Dr.C. Here was a man serving as a healthcare manager and a surgeon. My struggle over whether to work as a physician or to work in healthcare management did not have to be a blocked intersection. Throughout my life I have internalized many attributes and principles of the people I admire such as integrity, community, and service. I have since integrated those ideals into a philosophy that has become the working hypothesis for my life, as Dr.S encouraged me to do years ago. From my exposure to medicine and policy through Dr.C, to the lessons of dedication given by my family, finally to the physicians that made clear through their acts the need for compassion and service; I feel that the medical field suits my strengths and provides challenges that feed my determined spirit. If Dr.S were to ask what my view of the medical field is today, I would reply the challenges facing healthcare today will be the impetus to move it forward. They are likewise the same exciting challenges that move me toward the field of medicine. Physician Diversity/Cultural Competency Research Poster As a STARS Scholar I was fortunate enough to work with faculty and staff members in the medical and health fields.  In 2006 I worked with Dr. Joan Murdock in the area of Health Information Management on a research project titled Cultural Diversity in Medicine and its Effects on Patient Care.  This research study aimed to assess how equipped physicians may have been to serve a more culturally diverse America in the coming years. The project focused on the correlation between a physician's formal and practical training environments, their opportunities for and levels of cultural competence, and how those variables may affect the quality of patient care for underserved groups.,  Chief of Staff Summer Intern, Minority Premedical Org.: Academic Chair and Charter Member For years this organization was unable to get passed the planning stages yet with the diligence of a core group of about 5 students we charter a MAPS chapter at the University of Cincinnati. As Academic Chair I organized study halls and networking events with medical students and medical school admissions staff. I also helped to gather information regarding a number of different post baccalaureate academic options. We were able to lay a strong foundation and make the organization a success. The organization remains active. This group helped mold a strong network of students that I am still in contact with today. We continue to encourage, offer advice, and even study for the MCAT together., Research: Mouse Model of Maternal Obesity & Fetal Overgrowth I completed an undergraduate research project in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. The study aimed to find a correlation between maternal obesity and Large for Gestational Age babies. The study used a mouse model to investigate maternal obesity and the effects of nutrient transport mechanisms in the placenta on birth weight. From this project I gained a better understanding of how environmental factors such as adult obesity, and developmental factors such as nutrient transporters in the placenta, can affect one's health. Participation in this internship allowed me the opportunity to present my research at a number of symposiums and to be included in Dr. Jones' publication in 2009., Supplemental Instructional (SI) Biology Leader & Supervisor I facilitated study sessions for 1st year biology students. Having taken the same course with the same professor as the students, I shared study tips that might have illuminated concepts that were commonly overlooked. I viewed sessions more as scholarly exchanges than recitations. As a SI I noticed that there was always an opportunity to learn something new and enjoyed the challenge of finding novel ways to approach learning. I developed a motto with a group of students one year, To teach it, is to know it. I would then ask them to attempt to clearly communicate concepts back to me. From my time as a SI, I learned the importance of taking the time to learn foundational concepts in science., President of Cultural Arts Club & Dance Ensemble I reactivated BAC, a student organization, my freshman year which had been inactive for two years prior and was elected President by new and returning club members. I was presented with the unique task of rebuilding and reinventing the organization in a way that addressed the desires of artists from various genres. The organization celebrates the musical, dance, theatre, visual, and digital arts in the African American tradition with a mission of providing a forum to explore, nurture, and pursue artistic skills. As president I worked to promote the artistic pursuits of over 3 dozen individuals through galas, art shows, showcases, plays, and performances while also performing as a BAC dancer., Research Coordinator:Ctr. Autoimmune Genomics&Etiology(CAGE) I was attracted to this position because of the opportunity to work in the fields of public health, healthcare, and research. I primarily manage lupus studies that aim to find the cause of lupus through genetic and biologic family studies. The research done in CAGE depends heavily on having access to a large lupus family registry and repository. I recruit participants, structure, and implement plans for our lupus family clinical database and bio-sample repository, while also managing regulatory and administrative functions. I have been able to contribute to effects to create institutional and center policies, work in the lab, and interact with patients and staff in a clinical environment., Vice President-Programs & Sisterly Relations Chair I was elected to the highest available position of the chapter from my initiated line. Being a member of AKA has been a humbling experience and an intense exercise in character building. Though we were all joined by our dedication and admiration for a common mission I quickly learned, how to achieve that mission could be viewed in several ways. Aware of this challenging detail, I worked to identify each of my sister strengths. Verbalizing what I saw as their strengths seemed to motivate them. This approach was risky and had the potential to backfire if they did not agree or even worse, were offended by my assertions. However, the risk was worth the gain of my peers respect and cooperation., Ronald McNair Post baccalaureate Achievement Scholarship McNair is a program designed to assist undergraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds in their preparation for graduate school through various scholarly activities including undergraduate research. In 2007 one of the research projects I worked on evaluated the local Cincinnati program Minorities in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (M2SE). This project enabled me to gain insights as to how social disparities may affect minorities in educational endeavors.  It also showed me the value of assessment as a part of an intervention strategy. I found that there are many good ideas implemented with good intentions, however, every idea may not be suitable for a given situation., Shadowing Experience: Primary Care, Gynecology, Rheumatology Physician mentors exposed me to various areas of medicine. My experience in a primary care clinic illustrated how important it is to encourage the patient to take ownership of their health in order to get well. In OBGYN clinics I witnessed an array of women's issues. The issues were intimate and required careful concern from the provider. When following rheumatologists I observed that medicine is not always an exact science. Each patient may respond to medication differently and a period of discovery is often necessary to find the right treatment course. After having the privilege to shadow these physicians I have found that medicine is not only challenging and exciting but it is humbling.,  Research Assistant, Darwin T. Turner Scholarship Recipient This full tuition scholarship was awarded for 4 years in recognition of my academic performance in high school provided I maintained an average of 3.0 or better in college. As a freshman, I received the Award of Excellence which is given to one Turner Scholar in each year, as recognition of being a standout student. This program was my first support system in college. This was the first situation outside of high school that taught me how important it was to be accountable academically and personally. It was sobering to know that so many people were invested in my success. I also credit this program with teaching me the importance of adapting my study habits to the college setting., Assistant Dance Coach Through involvement with my college dance ensemble and our growing interaction with the surrounding community, a teammate and I were asked to coach a high school dance team.  I remember the joy and sense of achievement I felt as a young girl in school sports and activities and I felt privileged to be able to help make that possible for other young girls.  The team was talented and eager to express themselves.  The dance team provided a needed outlet for the students as well as an avenue to promote health and wellness in the school.  Every practice the girls would make me proud through their dedication and fearless creativity.  Though I was there to support them, they truly inspired me., American Red Cross Family Living Volunteer To assist the residents, I made and delivered toiletry care packages to families, helped set up internet access in the tutoring building, handed out turkeys for Thanksgiving, and sorted donated Christmas gifts for the children currently living in the living center.  Working in the center was a cathartic experience.  Though I was dealing with my own financial struggles, my troubles became trivial in comparison to the women at the living center who had little support.  I recognized how fragile life can be when faced with what seems to be insurmountable obstacles, yet these families overcame adversity daily.  I felt honored to be able to lend a helping hand in their time of need., Chief of Staff Intern-American Hospital Assoc. program While at the Dayton VA, two projects I worked on had a major impact on my healthcare perspective, the Physician Profile Project (PPP) and Employee Appreciation (EA) activities.  The PPP was a database consisting of information intended to be a tool to familiarize veterans with their provider. I viewed this as a tool to empower patients in an effort to improve patient centered care and transparency. In the second project I co-chaired the EA Week activities. I came to appreciate how important it was to have a positive work environment where the staff felt appreciated. This in turn makes good patient care more possible. Hospital staffs are key agents in making such an environment possible., Sex Education Public Health Advocate/Company Intern Working as an intern at PPLM I was involved in federal and local efforts to promote comprehensive sex education in middle schools. I worked on federal and local initiatives. The local initiative focused on recruiting parents of middle school children to become advocates for comprehensive sex education. I helped to create and assemble materials for a Parent Advocate Tool Kit for the Get Real program. The federal initiative I worked on consisted of a policy analysis and campaign plan to promote passage of the REAL Act in congress. The Real Act would allow federal funding to be used for comprehensive sex education programs., Young Professionals – Health and Environment Committee YPKC allows me to be involved in the community with regard to health and wellness issues. This group was formed to capitalize on the professionals within Cincinnati, and create a forum for them to more actively engage and promote a thriving city while having access to the mayor's office. The committee has been a great vehicle for networking and integrating singular efforts throughout the community together to generate a larger impact. I have been exposed to the cross-section of health issues and the opportunity for joint intervention. For instance, composting efforts has yielded opportunities for urban gardening efforts which has in turn supported inner-city healthy food access efforts."

    "text": "What excites me about medicine are the possibilities it presents. Medicine allows me to be a leader, to be a part of a team and to help my community. It is a career where I will be constantly challenged to be better and can work in the service of others. As a physician I want to be an innovator as well as an advocate. I want the decisions I make in my practice to be governed by the needs of my patients and the community in which they reside. I am inspired by people who see a need in the community and do something to fill it.  I have been involved in community service from a very young age, and throughout my life helping others has given me joy. I have learned that to a person in need a meal is not simply a meal and clothes are not simply clothes.  Providing them with these basic needs results in an obstacle removed and an opportunity made apparent. A little girl with a new pair of jeans no longer has to worry about being teased and can focus on her studies. An unemployed man whose family is fed can spend the money he saved on gas to look for a work. The little things are worth more than you think, and the joy of offering them is beyond what I would have expected. I have developed meaningful relationships with many of those I have served and feel that those relationships are richer because of the difference I can make to them and to our community.  The underrepresented and underserved in medicine, those of low socioeconomic status, low literacy, the elderly and minorities often have the most need and are often the most misunderstood. As an African American woman Ive seen firsthand that less acknowledged members of the community tend to fall through the cracks.  My auntie is one of the best cooks I know. Given a practically bare kitchen, she is able to whip up a delicious, rich and satisfying meal. But rich usually means butter and sugarin copious amounts. My aunt suffers from diabetes. Yet like a functioning alcoholic, she does what she knows and cooks as if her condition is unrelated to what she puts in her body. She has been hospitalized twice (that I know of) for nearly fatal high blood sugar. Once she was so incapacitated that all she did was sleep and throw up, yet she refused to go to the hospital. My cousin had to force feed her Pedialite. It is completely avoidable medical catastrophes like these which make me wonder: What did the doctor tell her to do Did her physician clearly explain the symptoms that indicate a worsening of her condition Did her doctor understand the limitations of a fixed income on the quality versus the quantity of food she can purchase There are a lot of unanswered questions. Consider this situation faced by many aunties in underserved and underrepresented communities, and you have an epidemic. In my community preventative care is not the standard and there is a dignity to suffering in silence. We handle things internally: within our community, within the family, and within ourselves. For this reason, medical professionals must align the way they practice medicine with the culture of the communities they serve. So when life-saving advice is given, it is coming from a trusted source. Additionally, the people who need help must also recognize when it is necessary to ask for it. I learned the hard way that there is no dignity in suffering in silence.  During my junior year I was working two jobs, taking 15 school credits, and held two leadership positions in two different organizations. I had also been diagnosed with a heart condition that causes unexplained palpitations. I was drowning but remained silent. I finally recognized how overwhelmed I was when I had to resign from one job and withdraw from a class. Over time, I realized I had friends, advisers, teachers, and doctors ready to help if I only asked. With help I  refocused myself and my efforts. Though still very self-reliant, I now recognize the power of relying on others. When I see people muddling through issues because they do not know how or where to ask for support, I can see the old me. There are multitudes suffering in a quagmire of their own making. However, just as I did, I want to help people see there is hope in these seemingly indomitable situations. With openness, empathy, knowledge and collaborative effort; everything can change.   Medicine is the vehicle for this change. It is no longer acceptable that a person has a worse prognosis by virtue of their skin color or how much money they make. Doctors all over the country are making strides to ensure this. At the Cleveland Clinic I was able to participate in The Minority Mens Health Fair which helps hundreds of men receive vital tests, screenings and health information. The Fair is now a staple of the hospital and the community. It is the brainchild of one physician that saw need and fought to fill it. This is how I see my medical career: as a healer, leader, and advocate. I want my patients to know that they can trust me and that I will fight to address their needs no matter the situation. I am determined to learn more and be better. I am excited to gain the tools to become a physician, and I will confidently parlay the knowledge and experiences I gain into a better healthcare system for the people I serve. Clinical Research Assistant As a clinical research assistant I maintained the compliance of four different prostate cancer quality of life studies. In this position I was able to receive HIPAA as well as CITI training for research with human subjects. My responsibilities included screening and consenting patients, abstracting data from medical records, contacting other medical facilities for information, and presenting study progress to the principle investigators. Prior to participating in research I did not understand how directly it can affect the practice of medicine. My experience has taught me that a hospital works as a system and that research is an important part of keeping that system moving forward., Cleveland Public Schools Connection Cleveland Public Schools Connection (CPSC) is a mentoring program I was involved in throughout college. I served as secretary of the organization for three years. Our members met once a week to plan activities and we went to Micheal R. White Elementary School twice a week to do activities after school. We tried to tailor them to their interests so we did a variety of things. We did science experiments, art projects, and athletics. Once a year we held a fundraising benefit luncheon for the school. We also brought the kids to Case to promote continuing education and show them college life. As a leader in CPSC I learned about taking charge but also working as a team to get things done well.,  Clinical Research Assistant, New Orleans Alternative Spring Break During this week long trip to New Orleans I was able to serve a community that was really in need. Even 5 years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city there was still lots of work to be done. My program helped construct a community garden in an area where fresh fruits and vegetables were scarce. We went to a local high school and spoke to the children about continuing their education and creating academic goals for themselves. The most impactful experience for me was volunteering at the Lower 9th Ward Health Clinic. I was responsible for organizing charts and medical supplies. But what really stirred something in me were the stories of the staff and the people they served., Shadowing Child Psychiatrist I had the opportunity to shadow child/adolescent psychiatrists Dr. John Glazer and Dr. Joseph Austerman. I learned a great deal about psychiatry under their tutelage. Dr. Glazer always took the time to explain the patient's condition and recommend articles for me to read so that I could really understand his treatment plans. Dr. Austerman taught me a great deal about psycho-pharmaceuticals. He always listened to how the patient perceived their functioning and mental status to determine dosage. Shadowing these physicians showed me how much I enjoy hearing people's stories. I recognize that truly understanding the story surrounding a person's illness is vital to treating their disease., Case Camerata Chamber Orchestra I have been playing the viola since I was 10 years old. I really enjoyed playing in my high school orchestra so it was great being able to continue in college. The Camerata Chamber Orchestra was a full string ensemble of violins, violas, cellos, and basses. We practiced classical and contemporary pieces which we performed at two concerts that year. Rehearsals gave me a time to relax and enjoy the music and instrument I have loved since childhood. I really enjoyed being a part of a group of fun and talented musicians., Volunteering at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital I volunteered at the Children's Hospital on the immunocompromised floor. Children came there for a variety of reasons; chronic illness, acute trauma, and transplants. My role was to make their stay in the hospital easier. I did a variety of activities with the kids and their families. I was responsible for individual as well as floor wide play times. I read stories, walked the ward, and played board games. I learned therapeutic play techniques and simple ways to motivate the children to comply with their treatments. I gained a great deal of practical medical knowledge as well as some experiences I will never forget. The children were so resilient and their positive attitudes inspiring., Youth Group I was a part of the Lake and Walnut Church of Christ Youth Group. The group promotes stewardship and fellowship among the youth in our church and throughout the community. We go to visit the sick members of our church and the members that are in nursing homes. The group also goes to an annual conference where youth groups from all around Ohio come together. As I got older I took more of the leadership role in the group. I mentored younger members on ways to help themselves academically and help the community. I helped them with college and career planning. I also assisted in planning events including group activities, fundraisers, and volunteering opportunities., Service Star I was acknowledged by the Center for Civic Engagement and Learning for my community service while at Case Western Reserve University.  The Service Star award is to recognize graduating seniors for their commitment to the serving the Cleveland area and Case community. I was recognized for my four years of service in Cleveland Public Schools Connection as well as my participation in the New Orleans Alternative Spring Break trip., Observing Surgery In 2011 I was able to observe a number of laprascopic pediatric surgeries. I saw two appendectomies and an inguinal hernia repair. In 2012 I was able to observe a live donor kidney transplant from start to finish.  In both instances I witnessed seasoned surgeons and residents working side by side. It was interesting to see the physicians' different teaching styles. Some watched over their students patiently guiding them through each movement while others sat comfortably on the other side of the room only coming when necessary. It is amazing to see the teamwork that goes into a surgery. Many moving parts work together to ensure the process goes smoothly and the patient heals properly.,  Research Assistant, Biotechnology Outreach Program The Biotechnology Outreach Program focuses on sharing science with the future of the field, children. We did events with kids ranging from 8 to 18 years old. I was responsible for the strawberry DNA extraction experiment. I explained to the children how strawberries have DNA just like us and that with some cool scientific tools we could see it. I walked them through the experiment and at the end they got to see a gooey glob of strawberry DNA they extracted themselves. It was a great way to get the kids excited about science and take it into their own hands. I did the experiment at the Johns Hopkins' Chemistry of Bread event and the national US Science and Engineering Festival in DC., Hot Meals Program The Hot Meals Program provides a much needed service in the city of Elyria. It is a more rural city whose resident tend to be of low socioeconomic status. To help the residents we provided a free meal once a month. We prepared and served food to people in many different circumstances. I met people from many different backgrounds, people going it alone, and large families of eight or more. Being in a town like Elyria you see that it is not just the homeless who can benefit from a fee meal. Living from paycheck to paycheck is very stressful and it was nice to help alleviate some of that burden just by feeding someone., Shoebox Ministry The Ministry started off very simple and evolved into something much greater. We began by filling shoe boxes with household items and everyday personal necessities. We would donate these to shelters and soup kitchens, any place that could distribute them. Over the years we started to develop our own programs. We created a yearly clothing give-away and health fair, school supplies give-away, and a holiday workshop. All three events are free and open to the public. Each takes a lot of work and planning. Throughout the year we plan the activities and buy and collect items. Closer to the events we assemble items and set up. With each event we are able to serve over one hundred people in need., Minority Men's Health Fair The Minority Men's Health Fair is designed to address the health issues that often disproportionately affect minority men. Accordingly, it provides screenings, tests, and information for diabetes, heart disease, prostate cancer and other such diseases free of charge. The Fair seeks to foster a preventative approach to medicine by establishing follow-ups and linking participants to primary care physicians. As a volunteer I greeted participants and showed them to appropriate booths. I also recruited patients for a study that sought to determine the agreement between saliva and blood urea nitrogen values for patients with different levels of kidney functioning., Tutoring Middle School Students This tutoring program paired Case students with a different child each week to assist with their homework. I was able to work with students ranging from kindergarten to twelfth grade. I helped the kids with every subject from math to English. I think my most important job as a tutor was to help the students find their own personal study style. It always helped to give them suggestions and show them how I came about an answer but the most useful part was showing them they were capable of doing it as well. Once a student finds their own way of learning and can hone in on how to apply it to the material academics becomes a lot easier. I enjoyed helping them achieve that understanding., Voices of Glory Gospel Choir Voices of Glory is a gospel choir made up of Case Western students, alumni, and community members. We use music to uplift others and ourselves. Our most events notable are the Fall and Spring concerts. Each year we used the proceeds from these concerts to assist a Cleveland area family in need. In addition to the concerts we raised money from raffles, bake sales, and other events to provide for the family. As historian my junior year I was able to do a large portion of the planning and implementation of our fundraising efforts. That year we had the privilege to donate to a family whose house had been ravaged by fire. Voices of Glory allowed me to sing and serve in one amazing organization."

    "text": "Excuse me, miss. Im going to need you to check your bag. I clutched the large, heavy garment bag even more closely to my chest, Im sorry sir, but I cant. The flight attendants eyes grew wide, Oh, my apologies! I didnt realize that was a wedding dress. For the fifth time that day, I clarified that I was not a bride-to-be, This is not my wedding dress, but to me it means almost as much. Standing even taller, I explained to him, In this bag is my uniform. I march for the Band of the Fighting Irish.  I wear a uniform that is identical to three hundred and eighty others. For the Notre Dame Band, sameness creates unity, and quite literally, a bigger picture on the field. Each time I dress, I sacrifice standing out in order to serve as part of something much larger. Once we are in uniform, the band stands in the tunnel and counts out loud. As commands pass back and forth, one voice after another repeating the same phrase, a synchrony overcomes the individual jokes and shouts. As we yell together, Here we go, yeah! the fans know the Band of the Fighting Irish has arrived. The minute the band takes the field, a single wall of sound fills the stadium.   Yet, in a marching band, the brass and drums notoriously overpower the woodwinds; I happen to play the clarinet. At fifty strong, my section simply cannot be heard---either individually or collectively. But without our balance, the band sounds less than whole. Though inaudible and just one band member, I remain necessary.    Off the field, my experience as a crisis pregnancy counselor stands in stark contrast to my role in band. While a dropped clarinet note vanishes beneath trumpets without anyone noticing, I could lose the chance to help a person with one wrong word. An untimely comment might cause a woman to hang-up the phone or walk out of the center. One night before my orientation was even complete, the center was short staffed and extremely busy. I found myself in a one-on-one counseling situation without a supervisor. A fifteen year old girl frantically told me, I dont know how this happened. I dont know how I got pregnant. My first thought was Really Youve got to be kidding me. Stunned, I realized she truly didnt understand the consequences of sexual activity. No one in this girls life had explained her reproductive system in a way that she could comprehend. I was in over my head; none of my previous training adequately prepared me for this. Whatever I said next would impact this girl directly. She clearly heard me while I methodically walked her through menstruation, conception, and implantation. As she listened silently, my words irrevocably altered her understanding of her own body.   Growing up, my natural, insatiable curiosity drove my business-minded parents crazy as I asked every possible question: How does this work Why Can you tell me more Science had answers---or at least offered the scientific method to go about finding them. My eighth grade teacher patiently answered question after question after question from me as he guided my class through dissection of pregnant sharks. I thought everyone else wanted answers too. Slowly, I discovered that my classmates did not share my enthusiasm. While a freshman in high school, I prepared biology study guides to help those who struggled. My well-meaning intentions landed me in the principals office trying to explain how the fifty students from both classes had my notes. My teacher gently suggested, Rachel, be a science teacher---dont just give away the information, teach it to them.   My teachers advice prompted me to explore the broad field of science. The more science courses I took, the more I gravitated toward life sciences and their applications. As I began exploring potential careers, medicine appealed to me immediately, but I couldnt pinpoint why. My college curriculum reinforced the attraction even though I still contemplated the question of why medicine. I have taught the core sciences both as a tutor and a TA, observed physicians, and volunteered in hospitals. However, my work at the pregnancy center allowed me to finally do clinical science and further defined my reason for pursuing medicine. When the fifteen year old girl returned the month before her due date, she invited me to place my hands on her belly to feel her baby kick. This intimate connection summed it all up: my work included my desires to fix, to solve, and to provide hands-on care. I combined my passion for educating others with personal interactions in the most crucial of moments.   Im drawn to where there is a need. My band experience aligns beautifully with practicing a profession based on collaboration and communication. I forgo fanfare willingly to serve as part of a team. Equally, I thrive in situations where someone must be heard and must take charge. When asked to react to unexpected situations, I remain confident in my ability to find solutions and figure out what needs to be done next. If given the opportunity, I will make the most out of attending medical school.  So, Here we go, yeah! Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Volunteer As a volunteer with the Child Life specialists, I bring entertainment to chronic “frequent-flyer” patients. The kids on the Hematology and Oncology floors light up because they see me as a “happy visitor”. Though I usually bring crafts, games, or movies to older children, I also help parents by fetching a cup of coffee or holding a fussy baby. I also use medical play toys to explain simple procedures to patients and hold their hands during shots and IV placements. “You know,” one tired mother mentioned to me, “You are the only non-medical contact we have had all day. We just needed to talk to someone from the outside world.” Giving just a little bit of normalcy was thanks enough for me., Notre Dame Summer Service Learning Program (SSLP) As an unpaid SSLP intern, I spent eight weeks working full-time at Pregnancy Center East (PCE) (see also Boehnen Grant above). I ran pregnancy tests, assisted with ultrasounds, and after completing training, counseled women one-on-one. PCE also offers material assistance for pregnant women and families with young children. I organized incoming donations, distributed formula, diapers, wipes, and clothes, and acted as a liaison between the center and other non-profits in Cincinnati. For credit at Notre Dame, I documented my experience in a journal, completed readings, and wrote a final summary paper.  Contact info for SSLP: Andrea Shappell, Associate Director of the CSC, shappell.1@nd.edu., Brother-Sister Dorm and Signature Event Commissioner As Brother-Sister Dorm Commissioner, I organized events with other student leaders that encouraged a positive relationship with our brother dorm. Events included a Halloween Costume Contest, a Valentine-making event for a nearby pediatric hospital, and combined religious services, including Mass at the Grotto.   In my other position, Signature Event Commissioner, I initiated the first annual Pangborn Easter Egg Hunt. Close to one-hundred basket-carrying college students eagerly scoured McGlinn Fields to raise awareness of the SOS Rape Crisis Center in South Bend. Despite the costs associated with the event production, we managed to clear five hundred dollars to benefit the center., Horizon Community Church Mission Trip Back2Back, an international Christian service ministry, sends missions to orphanages and communities in need throughout Mexico, Nigeria, India, and Haiti. After two previous missions to El Limon and Monterrey, I spent a week in Cancun with nine others from my church and five Back2Back staff members. We demolished a rundown chapel in order to rebuild a church that could double as a peaceful municipal center. Because the cement mixer failed to arrive, we stirred and poured cement by hand for hours in unrelenting heat--- an experience I will never forget. We also visited nearby orphanages, brought supplies to impoverished villages, and helped the volunteer medical staff at free clinics., University of Notre Dame Academic Recognitions Dean’s List: Fall 2011, Spring 2012, Fall 2012, Spring 2013, Fall 2013, and Spring 2014. Awarded to the top 30% of students in each college or school and calculated using the previous semester’s grade point averages; Contact info above.   Triota: Gender Studies Honor Society, Alpha Phi Chapter -Inducted in June of 2012  -This society requires members to maintain an overall 3.5 GPA in Gender Studies classes. Notre Dame members publish “Through Gendered Lenses, a yearly publication of gender-related essays, research, and theses. We also represent the Gender Studies department at Majors Night and social events. Contact info: Abigail Palko, Director of Undergraduate Studies, apalko@nd.edu., University of Notre Dame Concert Band & Varsity Bands Fall Semester Concert Winds is an audition-based, full-band ensemble. During the middle of marching band season, I have the chance to sit down, rest my weary feet, and play classical music on the bass clarinet. This group of talented musicians rehearses weekly and performs in an end-of-semester showcase concert.    As a member of the Notre Dame Hockey and Basketball Bands, I play clarinet at home games for both sports. We have been known to bang the glass at the rink and to storm the court after winning in five OTs. Additionally, whether during the day or in the middle of the night, our band always gathers to serenade teams returning home from tournaments. (Oct – Feb of 2011 and 2013), Notre Dame Boehnen Summer Internship Grant Recipient I received the Boehnen Grant after submitting a proposal to research the feasibility of adding testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) to services at Pregnancy Center East (PCE) in Cincinnati. This non-profit resource center offers women free access to both information and limited healthcare focused on pregnancy. After working there previously (please see Notre Dame SSLP below), I wondered if expanded testing could improve the overall health of PCE’s clients. My protocol compares PCE client data to that from clinics performing STI tests, then devises an implementation plan from the results. I will present my conclusions to the Board of Directors of PCE and the Gender Studies Dept., St. Joseph Regional Medical Center Emergency Room Volunteer I volunteered for three hours once a week as an assistant to the ER staff. Along with preparing examination rooms and restocking triage room supplies, I transported patients and kept them comfortable. I often shadowed different healthcare professionals as they diagnosed patients or performed emergency procedures. In addition to observing how the staff worked as a team, I learned how to maintain a professional demeanor in unnerving emergency situations. In order to gain exposure to a different medical field, I plan to volunteer in the NICU during the fall 2014 semester., Notre Dame Organic Chemistry I Lab Teaching Assistant Notre Dame’s Department of Chemistry uses proficient undergraduates as unpaid teaching assistants (TAs) to provide additional help to the supervising graduate TAs. I volunteered for three hours weekly in this notoriously tricky class and lab. Having recently completed the Organic Chemistry I and II sequence, I recommended fresh study strategies from a peer perspective. Most days I re-explained the pre-lab instructions multiple times because students were confused or needed a diagram instead of verbal directions. All students in my section passed the final exam, and I plan to continue as a TA for Organic Chemistry II next semester., Sponsor Employee and World Choir Games Volunteer Occurring every 4 years, the World Choir Games are the pinnacle of global choral competitions. Cincinnati hosted the 2012 contest, which drew 15,000 participants and over 200,000 spectators, as the largest international event ever held in the region. Prior to the opening, I aided the organizing committee by preparing training materials needed for the 4,500 volunteers. I worked full-time during the ten day event as a cashier for All-Pro, the Games’ official merchandiser. On top of this, I volunteered to guide participants to competition venues and interacted with visitors from over 60 countries. Contact info for volunteering: Karen Grissom, Volunteer Coordinator, karendgrissom@gmail.com., University of Notre Dame Marching Band The Band of the Fighting Irish rehearses 5 days a week and devotes entire Saturdays to home football games. We begin with an 8:00 AM march around campus, followed by rehearsal, and a pre-game concert. We travel as a full band to most away games and all bowl games. I performed at the Champs Sports Bowl (2011), the Discover BCS National Championship (2012), and the Pinstripe Bowl (2013). Each year, the band members and directors choose upperclassmen to be the leadership or the “CORE Band”. Selected to be part of this group for both my junior and upcoming senior year, I assist with band camp and the audition process. During the season, I serve as a rank leader., Notre Dame Learning Resource Center (LRC) Tutor The Learning Resource Center (LRC) is the official university academic help center on Notre Dame’s campus. The LRC hires highly qualified upperclassmen to tutor freshman and help them adjust to college workloads and exams. As a Group Tutor for Calculus B, I spent 2 hours weekly with 5-10 students. Without fail, that number rose quickly when exams approached. In addition, I privately tutored a student on an as-needed basis for Introduction to Chemical Principles., Moral Psychology Laboratory Research Assistant The psychology of childhood development intrigues me, so I contacted Dr. Narvaez about her current research on morality and behavior.  She invited me to join the First Birthday Club (FBC) section of her observational lab as a research assistant. The FBC explores interactions between infants and their mothers through video recordings of various tasks. My responsibilities included attending lab meetings and collecting behavioral data. I gained competence in new survey techniques, statistical programs, and psychology research methods. In addition, I was the first author for a literature-review article entitled “Is Pretend Play Good for Kids” published on Dr. Narvaez’s Psychology Today blog., Eat Well Celebrations and Feasts/Funky's Catering - Server To help pay the bills, I worked as a server for these two catering companies during summer and winter breaks. My tasks varied from passing trays to doing dishes to cutting wedding cake. I learned what it felt like to be neither seen nor heard, and how it felt to serve without being acknowledged. Holding a position as waitstaff opened my eyes and changed the way I see others. Now I never go into a restaurant without learning a server’s name and using it.  Contact info for Funky’s Catering: Michael Forgus, Owner, 513-841-9999, dates & hours included in totals above., Wellington Orthopaedics Student Observer Wellington Orthopaedics is a comprehensive treatment center with 22 physicians and over 50 therapists and ancillary staff. I followed Dr. Rhoad, a hand and wrist surgeon, through his ten-hour workdays for a week. He showed me both detail-oriented procedures in surgery and the hectic pace of office hours as he dealt with one patient after another. Dr. Rhoad demonstrated the art of medicine in his ability to move from delicately pinning a wrist fracture to discussing hot pink casts with little girls and golf swings as rehab with businessmen. He emphasized treatment as a process and arranged for me to shadow his staff athletic trainers, physical therapists, and occupational therapists."

    "text": "Of the four men who sat before us, Robert was by far the most timid. His dull, matted jacket matched his posture; eyes fixated on his fidgety thumbs. They were veterans of the Vietnam War engaged in a fine arts therapy program through the New Haven VA. They had volunteered to share their artwork and to speak about their experiences with psychological distress and disorders. The last of the veterans to speak, Robert lifted his head to begin a similar tale with an unanticipated final message. He emotionally recounted his battle with PTSD, depression, and alcoholism, describing how his return to a cold and disapproving American public only worsened his struggle. Yet as he shifted to the role of doctors in his saga, a subtle, yet complex tight-lipped smile unfolded, and he delivered a message now integral to my concept of the role of the physician: being a true healer is defined by Opportunity and Responsibility.  Prior to college, my motivation to pursue medicine was fueled by experiences through my father (a family physician) and a sincere, excited affinity for the natural sciences. However, through my broad undergraduate education and various experiences along the way, I have further cultivated this initial feeling of motivation into one of vocation.  When I was 13, I had the opportunity to go on a medical mission trip to Belize with a team of medical professionals. Too young to be involved in any diagnostic or prescriptive work, I participated as I could, recording heights and weights, and conversing in broken Spanish to people as they waited.  The gratitude in their eyes felt undeserved at the time, but over time and with lessons from people such as Robert, I realize that the best medicine has many, equally important elements, one of which I had seen in Belize but could not then define: human connection. I am attracted by the interdisciplinary nature of medicine that engages all those involved (patients, physicians, nurses, researchers, social workers, therapists, and sometimes even 13-year-olds) in the pursuit of the best possible care for each individual.  While many experiences have enriched and strengthened my drive towards medicine, my time as an intern at the Yale Center for Bioethics crystallized the many fragments of interest and passion into a singular, resolute heading. I have always been a person of numerous and diverse interests, and I often found it difficult to integrate them in mutually enriching ways. Before my experience at Yale, I had many motivating characteristics that I feel would help an aspiring physician; fascination for the sciences, passion for service, deep sense of empathy, and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Previously in my application I mentioned in broad strokes how I was affected by my experience at the Center for Bioethics, but it does not fully encompass the enriching opportunities I was afforded there: Visiting a pediatric hospice to discuss the misconceptions about palliative care one-on-one with the director, conversations with a Polish biotechnologist and a Singaporean social worker concerning transplant ethics, openly sharing ideas on healthcare systems with both consumers and providers from around the world, and being gifted with heartfelt messages from others like Robert. These wonderfully eye-opening opportunities, ripe with culture and insight, both inspired new passions for being part of a health care team and reinvigorated old ones. My experiences, diverse studies, and these lessons have given me perspectives on medicine, healthcare, and the healing potential that I believe will help me to deliver care responsibly and holistically.  I am coming to realize that the best medical providers play a complex and deeply important role. Not only is the physician called to be well-versed in current medical advances as a discerning expert of medical treatments, but also to incorporate each patients past, present and future to help craft their individual plans in the context of their cultural, social, religious, and personal lives. In this light, my deep interest in the sciences and my passion for connecting with and helping others find a mutual outlet in medicine.  Reflecting on Robert many times since, his two challenges for the physician ring true to me: opportunity and responsibility. A physician has the rewarding opportunity to take roles as a dedicated caregiver, a comforting presence, a confident mentor, a public resource manager, and a discerning advisor.  In addition, though, as frequently a major source of support and assistance in the most trying of times, Roberts second message was that physicians hold the critical responsibility to always strive to fill these roles for each individual patient. Rather than an impersonal, judgmental gatekeeper of resources, being an empathetic and committed healer working within realistic limitations, can make the difference between an individuals life as a homeless veteran and one dedicated to family and volunteerism. I hope to always remember that message, and someday to have the opportunity to use my passion for continuously reinvigorated knowledge and experience, melded with connectedness and compassion, to live up to Roberts understated but deeply meaningful challenge for my profession. August Term Scholar August Term is a three-week course for incoming first-year students that aims to develop the critical, analytical and interpretive skills of new students. The course consists of shared readings and discussions with a group of students, a faculty member, and an August Term Scholar (an upper-class student that serves as a class facilitator as well as a mentor both inside and outside of class). Selected based on academic record, leadership abilities, and recommendations, each ATS will be the first representative of the Transylvania student body, and as such, must strongly and proudly exhibit the leadership, scholarship, and liberal arts nature that our education instills in its students., Member of Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity Delta Sigma Phi is a social fraternity that has held the highest GPA on campus for 38 consecutive years and actively engages in significant community service. I was appointed as ELD for the 2012-2013 term and was responsible for informing the chapter of significant leadership opportunities, identifying members who have strong leadership potential, and working to realize it. Also, I was responsible for organizing biannual speakers for the chapter on the topic of leadership. This year, as Vice President, I oversee the academic success of our members and am working to integrate an innovative new member academic program that holistically facilitates the transition from high school to college., Faces Without Places Volunteer Faces Without Places is an organization that aims to remove barriers to education for children and youth experiencing homelessness in the Greater Cincinnati area. Known to the children as the Yellow Bus Summer Camp, FWP hosts an annual eight-week program that focuses on the education and extracurricular enrichment of its campers. While mornings are focused on developing skills in literacy, math, art, and nutrition, the afternoons consist of activities in enrichment, fitness, community involvement, and more. I have served as a volunteer to this program, acting as a tutor, mentor, and general assistant both inside and out of the classroom., Mentor/Tutor at Booker T. Washington Academy I have volunteered as a mentor and tutor at Booker T. Washington Academy every week since the beginning of the Fall 2012 semester. The program is called “Eagle’s Edge,” and it mainly involves helping underprivileged students (K-5th) with homework, helping manage field trips, and being a good personal example for the students., Instructor/Leader at High-School Ethics Workshop I was selected to accompany the dean of my University, a prominent philosophy professor, and one other student on a trip to lead a university-sponsored ethics workshop at the Loudon Academy of Sciences in Loudon, VA. During this two-day program, we introduced various topics that painted a picture of ethical thinking in academia and our scientifically advancing world. Here, I had to not only personally lead a small group of highly skeptical young scientists through exercises that were meant to challenge what they believe, but I also had to convince them of the importance of ethics in the sciences. This experience taught me much about leadership and the importance of ethics in the sciences., Physician Shadowing Experiences In order to explore my potential career, I shadowed various doctors over the last few years. Along with Dr. Taylor in orthopedic surgery, I have shadowed Dr. Kim Vormbrock in Family Medicine, Dr. Eric Richardson in Emergency Medicine, Dr. Ty Brown in Neurology, and Dr. Matt DesJardins in Primary Care Sports Medicine. Additionally, I attended a regional meeting of the Greater Cincinnati Health Collaborative with the medical director, Dr. Barbara Tobias on risk assessment tools and hospital readmission. These experiences, combined with the unique opportunities I was afforded through my time at Yale, have given me a clearer, more holistic view of healthcare and the practice of medicine., Member of Omicron Delta Kappa Leadership/Honorary Society Omicron Delta Kappa is a leadership and honorary society for upperclass students that aims to recognize those who have attained a high standard of success in college, bring together a group of representative students to mold the university, and finally to integrate the student body and the faculty in one constructive organization. Members are chosen on the basis of personal character, leadership/service on campus, and superior scholarship. ODK hosts various events and speakers to enhance the academic community of Transylvania University and to emphasize the importance of leadership and service on campus., VP of Programming- Phi Delta Epsilon Medial Fraternity Phi Delta Epsilon is an honorary medical fraternity whose goal is to create physicians with a lifelong commitment to the guiding principles of philanthropy, deity, and education through fellowship, service, mentoring, and formal training in leadership, science, and ethics. Members are chosen based on their academic focus, leadership qualities, and volunteerism. This year, I was chosen by our president to represent the chapter at a leadership conference aimed to build leadership skills in members. More recently, I was elected VP of Programming for the chapter, allowing me to orchestrate medically-oriented events for the members of Phi DE as well as the students and faculty of Transylvania., Member of Sigma Delta Pi Spanish Honorary Society Sigma Delta Pi is a academic honorary society specifically for students of the Spanish language. Sigma Delta Pi aims to foster a sense of community within the members of the chapter through the deep history and rich culture of Spain, as well as provide culturally enriching events for the University., Camp Courage Sponsored by Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and hosted by Camp Twin Lakes, Camp Courage was a week-long overnight camp for children of ages 6-15 with craniofacial disorders. This camp was paired and often combined with another similar camp for children with epilepsy, and I was able to regularly interact with campers from both. I served as a counselor at this camp and was paired with the youngest group of boys (cognitive ages 6-10). Camp activities included hiking, rock climbing, archery, swimming, team-building exercises, arts and crafts, self-esteem workshops, a talent show, and much more., Transylvania Leadership Award The Transylvania Leadership Award is given to one upperclass (3rd or 4th year) student per year to recognize outstanding leadership ability and noteworthy impact on campus life through that leadership., Presenter at the Transylvania University F.L.A. Conference The Transylvania University Foundations of the Liberal Arts (F.L.A.) conference is a two-day program that showcases student presentations to first-year students in order to provide an example of how to present a research paper. About 15 students at Transylvania each year are chosen based on the content of their research paper and the proficiency of their presentation. My presentation, entitled The Genetic Solution to AIDS: When the Cure is a Disease in Itself, addressed a hypothetical gene therapy to combat the progression of HIV into AIDS, and the ethical consequences that could transpire from its use as a primary treatment., Summer Intern: Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics The Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics hosts an annual eight-week summer program for undergraduates, graduates and professionals to come together from a wide variety of backgrounds to participate in various bioethical seminars, discussions and events. I was chosen by my university to attend this program along with others from around the world. Throughout these eight weeks, I had the unique opportunity to expand my academic horizon significantly through a holistic approach to many bioethical topics with a focus on biomedical ethics. The program culminated in the presentation of novel research papers from each intern., Member of the Transylvania Men's Varsity Soccer Team Throughout my first and second years of my college experience, I was fortunate enough to be able to play soccer for my university's team while receiving a great education. In addition to improving valuable skills in leadership, teamwork, time-management and networking, my experience with the sport (especially in college) has allowed me to expand my horizon significantly and serve my community. This process of broadening and giving back is exemplified by my nomination for the Capitol One All-American Team, my induction into the National Athletics Honor Society, and my volunteerism with organizations including College for Living through teaching at soccer camps., Free Clinic Volunteer at St. Joseph Hospital Working every other week, I volunteered in the Saint Joseph Hospital Free Clinic in Lexington, KY for one-two hours. My major tasks included ordering prescriptions for patients, aiding in completing, organizing, and distributing paperwork for patients, greeting patients and their families in the waiting room, transporting medical supplies to different wings of the hospital, and a wide range of other tasks. Throughout this experience, I was able to develop a better understanding of a patient population I was previously not exposed to, as well as become more comfortable in an inpatient setting."

    "text": "I want mine trollop red! This was the catchphrase of a 90 year old woman who captured my heart at Kindred Rehabilitation and Nursing. On Manicure Mondays I rounded up willing residents and brought them to a tiny cafeteria that was to be my salon. Id get the repurposed tackle box filled with polish and when I set it on the table, Dotty would break her silence, declare her rebellious intentions and then burst into a fit of giggles. Originally drawn to the idea of turning a fascination with my mothers old anatomy textbooks into a career as a doctor after attending a healthcare seminar at University of Cincinnati, this was certainly not the clinical experience I initially expected. But I came to love each of the white-haired grannies as my own. As each week passed, I learned a little more about them: some liked clear polish, some brilliant vermilions, others passionate reds. As different as their esthetic tastes were their life experiences: some had protested during Vietnam, some had stayed behind to take care of children, others had pursued careers. Their stories were about recent events, too. Dotty often worried about her worsening vision and what would happen to her disabled daughter, Susan, when she was gone. Feeling inadequately prepared to give advice on such matters, I often just sat and listened, sometimes offering to get us popsicles from the kitchen or to hold her red-nailed hand.   I found my inability to do more for residents like Dotty increasingly frustrating as I discovered the power of listening, of seeing a person as a collection of stories instead of a collection of tangled oxygen lines. I learned that even the most ordinary people in the most unexpected of places can have inspiring stories. What I lacked, however, was knowledge and training to affect their stories of health and happiness, their most vulnerable stories, for the better.   It wasn't until my freshman year of college that I realized how truly vulnerable patients and their families often feel. My grandfather had been diagnosed with Alzheimers Disease and as I watched him unwillingly retire from being the jokester of the family and forget who I was, I began to struggle with what I finally understood was an eventuality. Three days before the start of Winter Quarter, he passed away. For the first time in my life, I identified with the feeling of loss that Dotty had tried to convey when she told me about losing her husband. I did not cope well. My grades suffered.  When I saw C+ on my transcript, I decided to speak with my academic counselor. She encouraged me to think about why I had wanted to pursue medicine in the first place. I remembered Dotty. I remembered gaining her trust and wanting to turn my insight into better care for her. The memories of my grandfather came flooding back, too. This time, however, I also thought about his care and the people involved in it namely his physician. I had spent many afternoons in Dr. Kendricks office, and I now remembered his compassion. Dr. Kendrick treated my grandfather and our family as his own, going above and beyond to double check prescriptions, to make sure my grandmothers health didn't suffer as a consequence of dealing with her husbands disorder, and to provide us with information that we understood. It was also in his office, located in rural Arkansas with a high underserved population, that I had witnessed him treat patients out of his own pocket. People trusted him to be curious, to make tough decisions, to be a confidant and a healer. He had turned his love for the study of the human body and the human condition, his love for seeing the whole person into a way to help folks like my grandfather when they were at their weakest.   After speaking with my advisor, I knew that I wanted to challenge myself to be like Dr. Kendrick. Becoming a physician brings the responsibility of caring for life, of sometimes dealing with the heavy burden of loss -but the profession also demands the incredible and unique capacity to change the life of a human being for the better. At that moment, my passion to become a physician ignited. I became committed to realizing my capacity to be a powerful force for positive change.   Since then, I've striven to immerse myself within the medical field not only to gain a better understanding of the human body and its functions and wonder but to give comfort and strength to others to the utmost of my ability. This, in part, explains my decision to become an English major. Reading literature has allowed me to feel a range of emotions in sometimes unexpected and subconscious ways, permitting me to develop personal connections with characters often vastly different from myself. I have learned to analyze not only what people are saying, but how and why. I was fortunate to take a Narrative Medicine course where I read about personal tragedies and triumphs in healthcare, where I took on an outsiders perspective into dire situations, was asked to process appropriate emotions and to establish a personal relationship with the character. I am constantly reminded that stories lead to a more sympathetic diagnosis and can form a better relationship with patients. I plan to share this understanding with my peers and carry it into my medical practice.

    "text": "The music blared in my ears as I starred off into the pool. This was my moment. The moment I would win regionals in the 100 yard breaststroke. As I stepped up on the blocks, I could hear the crowd cheer with excitement, but I stayed focus on my goal. After years of training and preparation, I was confident in my ability to succeed in the pool. I sprung off the blocks and never looked back until my hands had hit the wall. With the number 1 next to my name, all the fatigue was erased from my body. The medal I earned represented years of 5 am practices, two-a-days, and christmas training. But the sport of swimming rewarded me with much more than that number 1. I learned that through hard work, dedication, and determination goals can be achieved. Growing up as a swimmer, I acquired the confidence and discipline to keep training towards my goal. I was determined to do the little things in order to gain larger rewards. This same mentality and dedication will help me achieve my new goal of becoming a physician.                                                          \t      Long before I had blossomed into a national swimmer, I found myself inside a hospital waiting room. I was only 11, but I was faced with the thought of losing my grandma. She had been diagnosed with stage two breast cancer and was currently undergoing a mastectomy. I didnt understand the medical jargon that my family discussed, but I knew my grandma could die. My grandma had made it out of surgery, yet I still didnt feel as if everything was alright. Then her doctor entered the room. In a simple ten minute conversation, he changed my viewpoint. I watched intensely as he spoke with my grandma and the rest of my family. Most of his words were far above my knowledge, but his tone and sincerity caught my attention. He did not tell my grandma that she was as good as new, but instead he spoke to her honestly. He gave her the facts and outlook. Yet, I saw her smile. He insisted that even if there were complications, they would work together to make sure she had a bright future. He showed my grandma that he was compassionate about his work and his patients. This was the day where my dreams first began. He had made my grandma feel safe and I knew I wanted to be able to do the same one day.  \t \tThroughout years of science courses, volunteer work with the Susan G. Komen foundation, and shadowing physicians, I knew I was destined to be a physician. I want to be a physician so I can provide care and give patients hope about their future. Being a physician is a way for me to use medicine to better the lives of others. I will get an insight in providing this care when I travel to Nicaragua on a medical mission trip this upcoming December. I will give the people the same reassurance and personal care that the doctor provided to my grandma. This opportunity allows me to prepare for what I want to do. I want to be the change that helps patients progress to get better. I want to be a positive influence that allows patients to trust me with their hardships.I hope my patients have faith in me like my grandma did in her doctor. To this day, my grandma not only considers him as her doctor, but as her friend who has touched her life. I believe I can be a friend to my future patients in the same way.                                                 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                  Working at Home Instead Senior Care has reconfirmed that I made the right choice to pursue this career of becoming a physician. It has given me the opportunity to work first hand with patients. I have been able to make personal connections when assisting in their home or at a facility. I was lucky to work with one individual over the course of a couple months. I assisted with her shower, provided transportation, meal prep, and housekeeping. I went with her to her doctors appointments and encouraged her to do all of her exercises as she was recovering from her second total knee surgery. I enjoyed getting to know her and being able to make her life better. But there were times when she didnt want to do what was best for herself. In these situations, I learned how to deal with adverse circumstances and adjust accordingly. I had to understand the patients needs and effectively adapt to bring out the best results.          My goal is to become a physician. I understand the sacrifices and dedication that must be made in order to succeed, but I believe I have what it takes to accomplish my goal. My previous experiences will allow me the ability to become the best physician I can be. I will use my commitment, dedication, and compassion in order to help people by providing them with a foundation of hope. I understand medicine is not magic, but with a good understanding of the patients needs I hope to be a friend that helps the patient improve. I have witnessed doctor patient relationships that work together to make positive progress. Healing a patient from illness, trauma, or a disease is not immediate nor is the preparation of becoming a physician. The personal reward of treating patients and helping people to improve will be immediate and is a major drive for me desiring to be a physician. I am committed, prepared, and ready to spring off the blocks into this journey  Caregiver, Honors Program I applied for the honors program at the University of Louisville when I was applying to attend the school. I was accepted and have been in the program since starting college. The program allows students to have priority registration, smaller classes, and additional opportunities throughout college. I have been on track to graduate with honors in December 2013. The program has specific requirements that must be met before applying and that must be maintained, such as maintaining a 3.35 GPA, completion of 3 three-credit hour honors courses in the first four semesters, and completion of an additional honors course each academic year., Triathlon Club I had previously been a competitive swimmer and wanted to start doing triathlons. I joined the club after it was formed in the fall of my sophomore year. The group work that is involved is a few triathlon meetings per year. About 20 hours of the school year is spent with meetings. Training for the events takes up a great amount of time. Most of my training is done individually because of hectic schedules, but there are times when the club gets together to do a run, bike ride, or swim workout. The club also provides an online training tool that sends out automated work outs for each day. I plan to continue my training and competing in triathlons., Study Abroad Scholarship I I received a $700 scholarship to use toward my study abroad program to Malaga, Spain. In order to earn this I had to submit an application and explain why I thought the scholarship would be put to a good use through my program., Hospital Volunteer I volunteered in the University of Louisville Hospital's ER through the volunteer program. It involved 2 different training sessions and individual volunteer hours. The work involved restocking gowns, towels, etc. We were also exposed to communicating with patients, doctors, and nurses working in the emergency room. I have also volunteered at local events supported by hospitals in louisville. Some of these events include Downs syndrome walk and Kosair's Boo to You Halloween Event., Special Olympics Swim meet I volunteered with my mom for the special olympics swim meet that they held at NKU or a local high school in the spring. My mom was a USA swimming official for the swim meet. I helped the swimmers get ready and make sure they were in the correct spot for each of their swims. I also worked as a timer for the swims. I was unable to locate the organizer's contact email address, but Debbie Ogdon was the event coordinator that organized the event and volunteers., Swim Team Coach I was a swim coach for the Taylor Mill Stingrays Swim Club for two summers. I worked mostly with 9-10 year olds and the 11-12 year olds, but was responsible for coaching the whole team from ages 5-18. There were four practices a week Monday through Thursday mornings and a dual swim meet on Thursday evenings. At the end of the season the swim league had two championship meets, All Stars and Champ Meet for all of the swim clubs to participate. In addition to practices and meets, there were team bonding events before and after meets. As a coach, I also worked with the other coaches to plan out which events individuals would swim, talk to parents, and run practices., Study Abroad Scholarship II I was awarded a study abroad scholarship by the University of Louisville. The $500 scholarship was used towards my study abroad program to Malaga, Spain through International Study Abroad. I had to fill out a scholarship application in order to earn the award., Home Instead I work as a Caregiver in the louisville area. As a caregiver, I provide seniors with many services that include home help, recovery care, personal services, alzheimer's service, and respite care. To become a caregiver, I went through a training program instructed by home instead. For the majority of the spring semester I worked Monday through friday from 9am to 1pm with one individual. For some of the other weeks I worked with several different seniors during a variety of shifts. I will be continuing to work for this company and plan to get my CNA in order to work with a greater patient population., Swim Lessons I worked as a swim instructor at Ralph Wright Natatorium on the University of Louisville's Campus. Most of my classes were taught in the group format with children from 3-14 years old. I also taught private lessons to children and adults. On average I instructed for 10-15 hours per a week. Cardinal Splash had several class sessions that lasted 5 weeks. The children were arranged according to ability and age. They would start at one level for 5 weeks and hopefully progress to the next level for the next 5 week session. There were requirements the children must pass in order to move on to the next level, but each lesson was created by myself or the individual instructor.,  Nanny, Phi Delta Epsilon Phi Delta Epsilon is a pre-medical fraternity made up of freshman through senior pre-med students. We have biweekly meetings where planned events, volunteering opportunities, and pre-med information is discussed. In addition to those discussions, most meetings had a guest speaker from the local louisville community. Different doctors would come and discuss their personal career path and to give advice. In order to join you must be admitted to the fraternity and do at least 15 service hours a semester, 5 of which must be with a Phi D organized event. Some service events that are organized are bake sales, Supplies overseas volunteering, and volunteering at the Dr's Ball., Breast Cancer Volunteer Susan G. Komen is an organization I have volunteered with for a number of years now. Originally I volunteered or participated in the Race for the Cure in Cincinnati, OH. Over the last three years I have continued to volunteer in Cincinnati, but also volunteer to help with race day in Louisville, KY with my sorority. As a race day volunteer I pass out waters, help set up, clean up, etc. I also participate and/or volunteer for the Making Strides Race in Cincinnati, OH that also benefits breast cancer education and awareness similar to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. I have  participated in Ride Cincinnati, which is a local bike ride that also benefits breast cancer education and awareness., Shadowing This summer I have had the opportunity to shadow Dr. Velazquez at Beacon Orthopaedics. He is a sports medicine specialist. Over the summer I have shadowed him once a week based on his and my availability. I have also observed surgeries at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio., Zeta Tau Alpha Sorority We have weekly Sunday night meetings to go over future events, announcements, and rituals. We also participate in Greek organizations' philanthropy events. We participate in campus events, competitions, and intramural sports as a team. The most rewarding aspects of Zeta are sisterhood and philanthropy efforts. We organize and hold our own events, such as Think Pink Week and Kiss Away Cancer, to support our philanthropy of Breast Cancer Awareness and Education. Zeta Tau Alpha is partnered with Susan G Komen and the NFL to raise awareness. We do a variety of volunteer events around the community during each semester. I serve as the assistant treasurer."

    "text": "Millennia of scientific advancement combined with centuries of humanism have truly put humankind in a convenient position when weighing the value of our existence.  We can humble our arrogance through the empirical knowledge that above ones head is a vast and incomprehensible universe, while at seemingly the same time, we can find pride in simply being alive thanks to the knowledge that only through the conscious choice of believing in this vast and incomprehensible universe, will it truly exist in our minds.  While in this case, utilizing both halves of the perpetual dichotomy which defines the human experience, the objective and the subjective, proves to be acceptable, we seem to be incredibly uncomfortable combining these two realms in our everyday lives.  We loathe the thought that our emotions and feelings might truly be no more than a series of chemical reactions in our brains (the objective encroaching on the subjective), and we likewise despise the rejection of what we consider to be scientifically irrefutable based solely on anothers beliefs or feelings (the subjective encroaching on the objective).  Unfortunately, the entrenched tradition of taking only one of these domains into account is undoubtedly the source of many of the paramount issues facing medicine and research today.  Through a unique choice in undergraduate curriculum and a diversity of life experiences, I have learned how a holistic approach towards real world problems, which takes into account both objective and subjective factors, is significantly more impactful than an approach leaning heavily towards one side or the other.  In bringing these experiences into medicine, a field in which the navigation between what is objective and what is subjective is absolutely vital, I believe that I can help to improve not only the quality of healthcare, but also how healthcare is delivered to individuals who, though they occupy the same physical world as their physicians, experience it through an extremely different lens.  When questioned about the seemingly erratic route my undergraduate experience followed, I frequently cite a quip written by J.R.R Tolkien, a favorite author of mine: Not all who wander are lost.  That being said, Ill admit that in entering college in the business management program, leaving the business school to declare a major in sociology, declaring a second major in French six-months later, and then deciding to integrate the pre-med requirements six-months after that, I was about ninety-percent lost and about ten-percent wandering.  However, almost like a painting begun at four corners of a canvas and arriving at the center to form something completely unexpected, the presumably unlinked subjects I chose to study so naturally led me down a path towards medicine and related research, that I went forward with it unquestioningly.  From a diverse and engaging study of the classic physical sciences, I gained insight into the chemical and biological processes that mediate every interaction between an individual and their physical world; a lesson in the objective.  From foci concerning social movements and disparity in Sociology, as well as linguistic and cultural subjugation in French, I gained insight into how unbelievable an impact the intangible characteristics of ones life, such as culture or upbringing, can have on ones wellbeing; a lesson in the subjective.  From what I have learned, it seems that the field of medicine, which must contend with the objective mechanisms of illness as well as the subjective mechanisms through which illness can be acquired and experienced, can not only serve as the epicenter for improvement in both the physical and social wellness of this country, but can also benefit greatly from a novel approach combining the two realms of my studies.  Many of my extracurricular pursuits have only highlighted how strikingly essential it is to approach problems with both the objective and subjective in mind, as well as the devastating consequences resulting from a failure to do so.  My uplifting yet harrowing work at the Mid-Ohio Foodbank has illustrated only too clearly how a failure to account for less tangible factors such as lifestyle, health behaviors, or social networks can result in substandard diets, malnutrition, and thousands of missed meals in Ohio every day, even when seemingly all the empirical barriers towards food distribution are met.  While honing my methodological and statistical skills, my undergraduate research, especially that concerning health outcomes for students in Cleveland City Schools, also allowed me further insight into how substantially an individuals perception of their environment or behavior can translate into objective physiological responses.  I want to help medicine reach the point where sociological concepts like diversity or cultural sensitivity are no longer simply used as buzzwords and catchphrases, but are synonymous with hand-washing or proper training in the unquestionable advantage they offer to the provision of quality healthcare.  In combining the social sciences together with the physical sciences in medicine, the subjective unified with the objective, a whole new realm of advancement in medical care will be opened for exploration. Academic Honors & Awards Alberta Garber Scott Fellowship Award (2013 – awarded the largest scholarship sum offered by The Ohio State University Department of Sociology for academic achievement & involvement in the major), Sociology Nominee for OSU College of Arts and Sciences Dean’s Award (2013), Phi Beta Kappa (2012-Present), Provost Scholarship (2009-Present), The Ohio State University Dean’s List (2009-Present), The Ohio State University Honors Program (2009-Present), National Merit Commended Scholar (2008), Solon High School Honor Roll (2005-2009),  Food Service, Undergraduate Research in Brewery Technology & Marketing For the semesters of 2012-2013 I helped pilot a new research-based course (Sociology 4998H) in which a select number of honors students were partnered with local area small businesses to conduct research projects for their benefit.  Working with Rockmill Brewery in Lancaster, Ohio I first helped establish a partnership between the brewery and a local water charity non-profit.  I subsequently proposed and conducted research which compared technologies and marketing strategies used by microbreweries nation-wide to those utilized by Rockmill, producing a variety of recommendations for the company’s business model.  This research was then presented at the Denman Undergraduate Research Forum., Recreation Leader at the OSU Dept. of Recreational Sports I began employment in the Learn-to-Swim program of the OSU Department of Recreational Sports in June of 2012 after a supervisor saw me swimming laps at the campus pool and invited me to join the staff.  I taught lessons 4 hrs/day, Sunday through Friday, in the summer of 2012 and was promoted to Recreational Leader in the fall of 2012 for outstanding conduct and time spent with the program.  I continued my employment during the 2012-2013 academic year, working about 4 hrs/week.  Thanks to my experience as a state-qualifying high school swimmer and (in one supervisor’s words) a “sonorous teaching style,” I have frequently been the highest rated and most requested instructor by our clientele., French Tutoring - Individual and Group I began studying the French language in 2003 and, quickly becoming enamored with it, declared it as one of my college majors.  I first experienced tutoring in 2009 after being requested by a parent to tutor their son for pay.  In college I was heavily involved in my school’s French Club and regularly attended or supervised a “conversation table” designed to help students struggling with the hard-to-grasp spoken language.  Furthermore, from 2010-2012, I volunteered at Café Plus, an out-of-class program designed to help students having difficulties in entry-level French classes.  I also worked individually with many of these students, editing and providing feedback on essays and assignments., Volunteering at the Mid-Ohio Foodbank I began volunteering at the Mid-Ohio Foodbank in January of 2012 after organizing a food-drive for a class concerning food deserts in the United States.  In March of 2012 I officially registered as a volunteer and, since beginning, have spent over 50 hours (or 1 hr/week) on a variety of tasks for the organization including: food reclamation (inspecting and sorting donated food), preparation of monthly CSFP governmental aid boxes, serving low-income and homeless customers at Manna Café in Columbus, and assisting individuals in utilizing the Foodbank Pantry. Beyond this, in sharing my experiences I have influenced five other individuals to regularly volunteer at the Foodbank as well., Treasurer - The Ohio State French Club (Le Cercle Français) I first joined the OSU French Club in 2009 while it was essentially a social club.  Upon my election to treasurer in 2011, I worked to reorganize the club’s structure to be more learning-based, as the French Department provided few opportunities for out-of-class practice.  Along with managing the club’s finances, I also organized and oversaw conversation tables designed to help students with oral French.  I was elected for a subsequent term as treasurer in 2012 and, in addition to my prior responsibilities, helped manage our club’s 2013 Taste of OSU participation. Though graduated from the organization, I still frequently meet with other alumni to keep up with the language., Eagle Scout - Boy Scouts of America, Troop 504 I joined Boy Scouts of America in June of 2001 and was actively involved until the summer of 2009.  During these eight years I completed over twenty camp-outs, six week-long summer camps, and a variety of service projects resulting in over 300 hours of volunteering and participation.  Most notable were an 80-mile backpacking trip in New Mexico and my Eagle Scout service project which involved the construction of a gravel path and repainting of a local church.  While a member, I held a variety of leadership positions including Patrol Leader and Assistant Senior Patrol Leader.  My experience in Boy Scouts culminated in my attainment of the Eagle Scout Award, Boy Scouts’ highest honor, in 2008., Treasurer - Plumina Writing Society In 2010 I joined Plumina Writing Society, an organization which provides essay editing services to students.  In 2011 I was elected as the club’s treasurer, and while responsible for managing the organization’s finances, I was also charged with an assortment of other leadership duties.  As treasurer from 2011-2012 and as a senior member from 2012-2013, I provided revisions and feedback on written assignments for students in the French Department and advised the editorial staff of our French & Italian literary magazine.  I also promoted collaboration with other language-based campus clubs and planned a variety of interdisciplinary functions including an OSU Cannes Festival film event., Sociology Faculty Undergraduate Studies Committee In 2012, I was selected by the OSU Sociology Department to be the student representative on the Sociology Faculty Undergraduate Studies Committee for 2012-2013.  My role was to represent the interests of students concerning curriculum and teaching decisions.  During the brief meetings, I tried to balance advocacy for the students with recognition of the limitations and challenges facing the faculty and department.  I specifically advocated the reoffering of certain courses (e.g. Honors Statistics in Sociology) as well as other issues mentioned to me by sociology majors.  I look forward to seeing if any of my diverse propositions will be incorporated into the department in the fall of 2013., Presentations and Research Related Awards In 2013, I won 4th place in my category for presenting research concerning Rockmill Brewery at the OSU Denman Undergraduate Research Forum.  The abstract can be seen here (Booth 369): https://denman.osu.edu/a_abstracts_current.aspxcw=Social_and_Behavioral_Sciences&year=2013 .  In 2005, I was invited to the Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge in Washington D.C. to present chemistry-related research.  As a finalist at the event, I was awarded the namesake of Minor Planet #21915.  I later presented the research at the Ohio Academy of Science (Board 161): https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36408/V106N1_A2.pdf;jsessionid=C0CDD7C0CA2E4C612DEC0B8F6E530BB9sequence=1, Clinical Observation & Shadowing at University Hospitals In May of 2013 I spent 25 hours shadowing Drs. Martin Wieczorek and Nancy Cossler at MacDonald Women’s Hospital in the UH Case Medical Center.  I experienced a number of routine Ob/Gyn appointments, two Caesarean Section operations, and one vaginal delivery.  I also had the chance to participate in a 3-hr resident education session involving lectures followed by problem-based learning activities.  Beyond this, I spent time with a variety of nurses and technicians, briefly experiencing their role in the hospital.  Lastly and most poignantly, I sat in on a tension-filled monthly Action Committee meeting which addressed a diverse number of issues confronting University Hospitals’ Ob/Gyn staff., Undergraduate Research in Sociology and Collective Action In the spring of 2011, I began an unpaid position as a research assistant to Dr. Andrew Martin, an associate professor in the OSU Department of Sociology.  His research focused on the strategies employed by labor unions when striking as well as the depiction of their cause by the media, with the goal of determining the most effective means by which labor-based social movements can achieve success.  I worked 5-10 hours per week, primarily performing content analyses using the database LexisNexis.  While at times prosaic, the work strengthened my competency in statistical analyses and related software (Stata), all while heightening my appreciation for research in the social sciences., Undergraduate Research in Sports Medicine & Health Behavior In the summer of 2011, I began an unpaid position as a research assistant to Dr. Paul Gubanich, a physician in the Sports Medicine Department of Wexner Medical Center.  Building on Healthy Futures, a program Dr. Gubanich began while at the Cleveland Clinic, our research involved assessing student health in the Cleveland City School District in order to identify the major obstacles preventing improved health outcomes in inner-city populations.  For 3-4 hrs/day I translated accelerometer data and coded survey information into spreadsheets, upon which I performed basic statistical analyses.  Being located at a sports medicine clinic, I also could enjoy a unique perspective of a medical setting., Other Hobbies and Interests Of the many activities I enjoy when not participating in the others mentioned in this application, most central to my identity are the varied physical activities I take part in.  Before college, I was captain of my high school’s swim team and still swim laps weekly, in addition to running, weight-training, and yoga.  In 2011 I ran the Nationwide half-marathon and plan to run the full-marathon this year.  Also, my senior research with Rockmill Brewery inspired a great interest in the science and marketing of beer production, prompting an increased appreciation and exploration of the emerging microbrewery and restaurant scene in Columbus, as well as a number of attempts at home-brewing., Physician Shadowing at Franklin County Coroner's Office On May 17th of 2013 I spent approximately eight hours shadowing Drs. Jan Gorniak, John Daniels, and John Somerset at the Franklin County Coroner’s Office.  I had the opportunity to witness four complete autopsies with full explanations provided by the attending forensic pathologist.  While I was at first, in all honesty, fairly traumatized (primarily due to the extreme nature of each victim’s death), the fascinating and intricate process of determining the cause of death for each decedent quickly erased any lingering doubts.  Especially piquing my interest was the unique methodology each pathologist used in their craft, giving me a greater appreciation for their frequently overlooked work.,  Swimming Instructor"

    "text": "The Doctor Frankenstein of Toasters is what my mother used to call me. With summers in Arizona too hot to play outside, as a child I would pass the time taking apart old electronics and appliances. Although I didn't know a capacitor from a motherboard, I was intrigued that individually these parts did nothing, but once properly aligned and connected they created an amazing piece of technology.  Little did I know this curiosity would lead to my desire to become a physician.   While I never outgrew my taste for metallic deconstruction, I was eventually forced to expand my horizons.  As a teenager my parents encouraged me to do volunteer work. At first I hated it. There was not a single bone in my body that wanted to run a bingo game at the retirement home, or get up early on a Sunday to be an acolyte at my church. Over time, however, I realized these chores were not sucking me dry with boredom. Instead, I shared in the joy that others felt when I made a small contribution to improving their day. Helping others in my community provided a sense of service and accomplishment that I wanted to incorporate into my life and future career choice.  When I was 16 my life took a sudden turn and my idyllic childhood came to a screeching halt. My dad was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer.  Over the next six months I was forced to become an adult as I watched my father die and my mother become a widow. This was my first exposure to the integrity of the medical community. Watching how everyone from doctors and nurses to social workers and clergy work together for the benefit of my father and family made me interested in learning more about medicine.  I entered college with two requisites: to find a field of study that I could embrace fully and one with which I could do good in the world.  My decision to major in physiology was solidified during my study of lipids. At first I couldn't understand why these seemingly useless molecules merited a whole lecture to themselves. Then it hit me: individually these phospholipids dont do much, but once they are aligned properly they form a cohesive functioning unit and become the basis for cells and life. Cells had now become the biological appliance that I could explore. I was intrigued with what other wonders the human body held. With each subsequent physiology class my appreciation for the human body grew.  As my passion for science and physiology was flourishing I began to volunteer at Nuvo Gen, a cancer research lab at the University of Arizona. Our research focused on exposing cancer cells to different kinds of compounds found in the Sonoran desert. While there I saw firsthand the connection between science and medicine. Our hope was to find a naturally occurring compound that could be used to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells while leaving noncancerous cells relatively unaffected. My research experience deepened my understanding of evidenced-based medicine and the role that research and clinical trials play in medicine and ultimately patient outcomes.  Through my volunteer experiences I have observed that although the treatment of medical illness is founded in science and technology it is greatly enhanced by the physician's ability to listen, comfort, and problem solve. As a hospice volunteer I sat with Charlie, a World War II veteran. He would reminisce about the days of his youth in Wisconsin growing up on a dairy farm and each day I would hear another chapter of his amazing life story. I was honored to be the one to listen to Charlie, to hold his hand and provide for his needs. By doing so I learned the art of empathy and the importance of patient connection.  Today I am working in a hospital Emergency Department as a medical scribe. Being immersed in a hospital setting is both instructive and exhilarating. My position offers me daily interactions with patients and the opportunity to observe physicians in a variety of clinical situations. In the Emergency Department I see the anatomical structures and the physiological functions I learned about in classrooms come to life. Through college I learned the amazing interconnectedness of the parts and functions of the human body and now through clinical observation I see what happens when one part of this wondrous machine fails or becomes diseased. My dream of becoming a doctor resonates daily for me while I am at work. The prospect of studying medicine is the culmination of every passion that I have developed throughout my lifetime. It fulfills the sense of curiosity I had as a child, the feeling of purpose and compassion I discovered as an adolescent and the allure for knowledge I developed as an adult. Teaching Assistant After graduation I was fortunate to become Dr. Jorstad’s teaching assistant for one year. It was my role to attend all classes and assist students with questions during lecture. I held office hours if they were needed and ran review sessions prior to exams. Constructing, editing, and grading exams was also an important responsibility of mine. I was happy to help with anything that made it easier for Dr. Jorstad to conduct her class., Medical Transporter As a hospital medical transporter my primary role was to transport patients in a timely manner. I was also responsible for running samples to the lab for testing. Most of my time was spent taking patients from the ER to their room or from their room to a testing area.  During this time I acquired one-on-one experience assisting patients to and from their beds. Even though I was only moving patients, I felt I was contributing in a small way to their treatment process. My conversations with patients gave me insight into their concerns in a hospital setting and it was rewarding to see a patient’s anxiety relieved when their symptoms were diagnosed and a treatment plan put into place., Tutor for Introdutory Biology As an undergraduate I worked as a tutor in two Introductory Biology courses, one taught by Dr. Susan Jorstad and the other by Dr. Lisa Elfring. I was required to attend every lecture, monitor exams, hold office hours for at least three hours a week, and attend a weekly staff meeting. I enjoyed supporting the students and clarifying biology concepts they were having difficulty with. While with Dr. Elfring’s class I supervised other tutors as the group leader and reported to the tutor coordinator every week with updates on how the class as a whole was progressing., Lab Assistant For two years I worked as a lab assistant for NuvoGen Research at the University of Arizona. The focus of our research was to conduct multiple screening assays to determine how virulent specific compounds are to cancer cells. My emphasis was working with pancreatic cancer cells, but I also screened breast, prostate, and colon cancers, as well as normal human epithelial cells to ensure the compounds didn’t affect noncancerous cells. Throughout my time at NuvoGen I worked with roughly 6000 different compounds. The compounds used were pure extracts from plants and fungi found throughout the Sonoran Desert, and from the National Cancer Institute Library., Graduated with Academic Distinction Graduated Cum Laude: Cumulative GPA over 3.60  Dean’s List with Distinction: Semester GPA of 4.00 Spring 2010  Dean’s List: Semester GPA of 3.5 or higher Fall 2009, Fall 2010, Spring 2012  Academic Year Academic Distinction: GPA over 3.5 after 30 credit hours Fall 2009, Spring 2010, Physician Record Assistant I am currently working as a physician record assistant (scribe) in the emergency department for two local hospitals. My primary role is to interview patients and take a general health history including symptoms they are experiencing, surgeries they have had, and medications they are taking. This provides the physician with a great deal of information before even seeing the patient. Recording accurate documentation for the physician prior to patient contact contributes to provider efficiency and productivity while allowing more quality patient time for the physician. I also assist the department by preparing rooms for patients and following up with lab results and radiology images., Acolyte I served as an acolyte for my church from ages 13 to 20. My role was to assist the clergy during Sunday services. My responsibilities were to lead the procession, set up and assist with communion, and make sure all sacramental supplies were in place where and when needed. I was awarded the silver cross honor to recognize my 7 years of commitment and service to the church. Being as active member of my church provides a community of fellowship which I enjoy being part of., Volunteer My time at Primrose School has been a unique experience since it is my first time volunteering with children who aren't sick or in crisis. My role at the school has been varied including: assisting in the front office, filming special events and performing building maintenance tasks. It has been fascinating to observe child development and note the amazing verbal and cognitive growth a child makes from infancy to age 5. I have enjoyed the opportunity to work in a school setting and have appreciated learning more about careers in a non-health environment.,  Physician Record Assistant,  Teaching Assistant, Volunteer The Casa de los Ninos Children’s Crisis Center is a transition facility where Child Protective Services places children who have been removed from their homes and have no family or foster care immediately available. I received extensive training to learn strategies to support children in crisis and to become familiar with child abuse state laws. It also prepared me for the sights and stories of abuse I would be faced with. As a volunteer I spent 3 hours each week playing with the children to offer positive distraction from their current situation. This experience broadened my perspective by giving me a glimpse into the stress and dysfunction that plague many homes in my community., Physician Shadowing While shadowing Dr. Robert Kingston, an emergency room physician, I was able to observe the wide variety of symptoms he encounters every day. What I found particularly interesting was Dr. Kingston’s ability to make a fast and accurate diagnosis by asking specific questions while collecting a thorough history of the patient. Lab work and imaging tests would usually come back only to confirm his original diagnosis. Dr. Kingston exemplified for me the competence that a physician acquires over time and the positive effect of rapport on patient interactions., Volunteer While volunteering at Casa de la Luz I saw firsthand what a patient and their family go through when faced with a terminal illness. Mostly I worked at the inpatient unit where I would sit with patients who had no family to keep them company. If the patient was conscious I would talk to them and have them tell me about their life. At Casa de la Luz we cared for families just as much as we cared for our patients, whether that meant making a pot of hot coffee or ensuring there was an ample supply of tissues available. Anything to ease the families’ worries at this difficult time was important. I felt honored that I could provide comfort for patients and their families at this emotional time."

    "text": "Staring into a Stage IV pressure ulcer with the approximate width and depth of a cereal bowl, I marveled at how my anatomy textbook had done the layers of dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and bone justice.  Still, I had never expected to see this image today in a conscious patient.  It was my third week of shadowing internal medicine hospitalist Dr. Marco Callirgos.  As he undressed the wound on his patients buttock, I had been prepared to see a bedsore, but not one of this magnitude or with this odor.  I began to feel faint, quietly excusing myself from the room to prevent what would later become a figurative tipping point in my life from immediately becoming quite literal.  Dr. Callirgos found me seated in a nearby waiting area just minutes later.  Embarrassed, I apologized and explained my hasty exit. His response is one I will carry with me forever.  To my surprise, he laughed reassuringly and said simply, Dont worry, Libby.  We all have edges that we find at one point or another.  And then we moved on.  I continued to see that patient and countless others over the next three weeks with no negative physiological ramifications.  That day, ironically, rendered my desire to become a physician more resolute than ever because I realized obstacles are to be expected on the journey.  Dr. Callirgos words had underscored the methodology guiding my path toward medicine: find an edge and move beyond it. I remember finding one of those first edges on my path toward medicine as an 8th grader, feeling incredible fear when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer.  During the year of her mastectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation, my anxiety transformed into a wonder of medicine as my moms treatment proved effective and she was declared cancer-free.  This new curiosity provided the impetus for me to attend a summer leadership conference on medicine and healthcare at Georgetown University.  The program gave me my first peek at a cadaver and a mock patient from whom I nervously took a History and Physical.  I remember feeling deliciously out of place as a high-schooler hanging out in a gross anatomy lab at a medical school.  Ill never forget the exuberant feeling I had after leaving my patients room with a page of notes to help my team diagnose her illness.  I left the program craving more medical experiences.  A summer spent shadowing under the mentorship of Dr. Thomas DeWitt at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital allowed me to observe in many specialty areas.  That summer also piqued my interest in the business side of health care, as I was given the opportunity to shadow several business unit directors.  By the end of the summer, I thought I stood at a fork in the road.  I was confident that I wanted to pursue medicine, yet every physician I discussed my interests with agreed that physicians could benefit from having some business acumen.  Realizing I could have the best of both worlds at Miami University, I declared a Management & Leadership major while committing to a pre-medicine track.  Far from being diverging branches, I have discovered that business and science are parallel, complementary tracks.  My study of business has given me opportunities to mentor others as an Undergraduate Assistant, to balance a workload with diverse content, and to gain immense experience working on teams.  An unexpected symbiosis between science and business exists, and I am intrigued by ideas of motivation, evidence-based management, and health care legislation as they apply to medicine.  I know my study of business principles has provided unique insights and skills that will benefit me as a physician.       My non-academic pursuits at Miami have been equally influential.  Involvement in my sorority, Alpha Omicron Pi, has allowed me to continue to grow as a leader.  During my sophomore year, I served as the risk manager for our chapter as VP of Standards.  Currently, I serve as Chapter President. Both positions have challenged me to communicate with, inspire, and hold accountable 170 members.  I must be prepared to confront and resolve uncomfortable issues at any time.  My ability to communicate with a variety of different people  officers, general membership, advisers, International Headquarters staff, and representatives of our Greek governing council  has prepared me to successfully interact with the diverse spectrum of people I will encounter as a physician, while managing my time effectively.       Each experience in my path toward medicine has shown me there will be times of discomfort and struggle, but none that cant be overcome with diligent work and a positive attitude.  Just as Dr. Callirgos told me, finding ones edge is essential to moving beyond it. My experiences have taught me that I can handle the obstacles and find creative ways to confront them.  Time and time again, I see the signs that point me toward medicine.  I am a learner, a sponge, a relator, and a seeker of challenges.  When I see patients, I get those butterflies and that inner joy that all but whisper to my consciousness, This is where you belong.  The uncertainty and the struggles exist to challenge us and make us stronger, and I know that I will continue to find new edges as I continue on toward medicine.  Ill look forward to it. Chapter President - Alpha Omicron Pi Alpha Omicron Pi is an international women’s fraternity promoting friendship for a lifetime, inspiring academic excellence and lifelong learning, and developing leadership skills through service to the fraternity and community. As Chapter President of the Omega Chapter of Alpha Omicron Pi, I lead a chapter membership of 170 women with a 28-member Leader’s Council and Cabinet.  My responsibilities include leading chapter and executive meetings, delegating to officers, and reflecting AOII values at all times as our chapter’s representative to campus administration, the student body, the community, and the International Fraternity., Group Fitness Instructor As a Group Fitness Instructor, I teach weekly Spinning and Toning classes to patrons at the Miami University Recreation Center.  I am responsible for teaching classes in a safe and effective manner, having an enthusiastic and encouraging attitude, and completing required continuing education courses to maintain national Spinning, First Aid, and CPR certifications.   As a Group Fitness Instructor, I’m able to incorporate several hobbies into my job.  Exercise is one of the best ways I have found to manage stress and Spinning is my favorite type of exercise.  Working as an instructor also enables me to channel my love of music into making new playlists each week., General Pediatrics Summer Intern As a participant in the General Pediatrics Summer Internship Program at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, I spent 8 weeks at Cincinnati Children's Hospital as a mentee of the General Director of Pediatrics, Dr. Thomas DeWitt.  I shadowed 12 physicians across various specialty units including Primary Care, NICU, Breastfeeding Medicine, Colorectal Surgery, Emergency Department, and Hospitalist Service.  I completed data entry for a research project of Dr. Melissa Klein investigating reasons behind frequent attendance (8+ visits per year) of patients in the hospital's primary care clinic. I presented on both my shadowing experiences and the research project at the end of the summer., Summer Orientation Resource Guide As a Summer Orientation Resource guide, I worked with incoming first-year students and their families prior to and during their first-year summer orientation experience at Miami University.  I was responsible for scheduling student visits in an online system, compiling and distributing resources to students and families, and serving as a campus ambassador during each of the 22 orientation programs.  Our seven-member team grew close and functioned as a cohesive unit throughout the summer, making the experience a valuable one for my development as a successful team member., Campus Tour Guide As a tour guide, I provide campus tours for prospective Miami University students and their families.  I am responsible for orienting students to campus, providing safe and informative tours, and answering any questions students or family members may have.  I also serve on student Q&A panels during events coordinated by the Office of Admission and attend monthly meetings to stay up to date on campus information.  Additionally, I assist in training new guides through shadowing and joint tours. I love serving as a tour guide because I get to share my Miami experience with others and I have the opportunity to answer questions and address any concerns students or family members may have., Undergraduate Assistantship As an Undergraduate Assistant to Professor Helen Koons for her Introduction to Marketing Principles Course (MKT 291), I served as a mentor to students and teams within the class, providing feedback based on my own experience. Repeating the course in a new role gave me a new perspective and deeper knowledge of the subject.  I know this experience will be valuable in the future, particularly in the medical field.  As a physician, I will be a constant student, learning new techniques and treatments all the time.  I will also be expected to teach others.  The mentorship skills I learned during my assistantship will be valuable throughout my future education and career., Rising Leader Award At the 2012 Greek Awards, I was recognized by the Miami University Greek Community as the Panhellenic new member showing most promise as a leader.  Prior to receiving this award, I attended a Greek leadership retreat called Acropolis as the delegate for my chapter.  I also served my chapter of Alpha Omicron Pi as the Vice President of Standards and Risk Management during my sophomore year.  This was an incredible opportunity for growth and learning for me, as the role is typically filled by an older member. In my role, I developed new practices for positive behavioral recognition within our chapter and learned how to effectively manage and resolve conflict., Dean's List During each semester of my undergraduate education, including the most recent Spring 2013 semester, I have exceeded a 3.5 grade point average, earning a position on the Dean’s List. To generate the 500 hour metric, I approximated 35-40 hours per week over the 16-week semester spent on my course work., Extended Shadowing with Dr. Marco Callirgos During the summer of 2012 I spent six weeks shadowing Dr. Marco Callirgos, an attending physician in the Generalist group at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, OH.  Following Dr. Callirgos’ daily schedule, I accompanied Dr. Callirgos as he saw patients on cardiac, general inpatient, psychiatry, and ER floors.  In addition to shadowing, each day Dr. Callirgos assigned me a specific topic to research that night.  The topic always related to a disease, symptom, or diagnosis we had seen in a patient.  Performing this research and reporting back to Dr. Callirgos the next day made it an incredibly valuable learning experience for me., Mercy Hospitals Volunteer I currently serve as a weekly volunteer in two Cincinnati hospitals in the Mercy Health Network. At Jewish Hospital, I work in the Cardiovascular Surgical Unit, rounding on patients hourly.  I update patient whiteboards to ensure comprehensive information, I offer snacks to patients without fluid or dietary restrictions, and simply spend time talking with and listening to patients recovering from cardiac procedures. At Mercy Anderson Hospital, I serve in various roles based on hospital needs., Harassment & Discrimination Review Panel I was appointed on behalf of Miami University President Dr. David Hodge and the Vice President for Student Affairs as one of ten Miami students to serve on the 2012-2013 Harassment/Discrimination Review Panel.  The panel reviews findings of the Office of Equity and Equal Opportunity in cases where a party to a complaint requests a review., American Medical Student Association In the fall of my junior year, I joined the Miami University chapter of AMSA Premedical. As an organization committed to helping Miami University students gain the experiences and knowledge necessary to succeed as medical students and doctors, I wanted to take advantage of the resources available for MCAT preparation and the medical school application process.  I also wanted to continue to meet Miami pre-medical students to build my support system as I continued on my path toward medical school.  I have particularly enjoyed the service aspects of AMSA, such as getting involved in the AMSA 5K on Miami’s campus and volunteering on behalf of AMSA at nursing homes in Oxford this year.,  Sales Associate, Miami University Student Foundation Since my freshman year, I have been a member of the Miami University Student Foundation. MUSF serves as a campus liaison between students and alumni, working to fill voids in student programming while raising funds for student scholarships throughout the year.  During my sophomore year, I served as a member of the Senior Week and Parent’s Weekend Committee.  During my freshman and junior years I served on the University Relations Committee.  I also give MUSF campus tours for alumni and their prospective students, and have worked on behalf of MUSF at Miami University’s Alumni Weekend each summer since my freshman year., Harrison Scholarship The Harrison Scholarship is a four year full tuition academic scholarship awarded to a small group of undergraduate students each year.  The scholarship is named after Miami alumnus and 23rd U.S. President Benjamin Harrison and is granted in combination with the Miami University Honors Program.   The Harrison Scholarship has enabled me to pursue a pre-medical course of study about which I am passionate by making it financially feasible to plan to continue my education beyond the undergraduate level.  I am honored and humbled to be a Harrison Scholar. The award is a constant reminder of my love of learning and adds daily motivation to my goal to maintain high levels of academic achievement., Undergraduate Research Forum Throughout the Fall 2012 semester in the course Introduction to Management and Leadership (MGT 291), a partner and I developed and conducted a research project under the guidance of Dr. Megan Gerhardt.  The project investigated motivational and satisfaction factors in the student worker population at Miami University and compared them to these same factors in student non-workers.  We presented the project in April 2012 at the annual Undergraduate Research Forum.  Highlights of our project were included in a university press release as well as during the luncheon for the Forum.,  Tour Guide, Group Fitness Instructor"

    "text": "Seeing tears of happiness is always an impactful experience. It is such a rare occurrence that those few moments really stick out in your life. It was not a normal day of shadowing. I was going from room to room with Dr. Garcia and observing his every move. He went through each patient meticulously and made sure to take his time advising his patients how to handle each of their individual problems. As the day was coming near its end we visited a different family, a child with pectus carinatum. The doctor enlightened the family about the disorder and informed them they would need a brace. The doctor also jokingly said that the condition was a sign of intelligence. This made the boy smile and allowed him to be a little less self-conscious about the condition. When I saw this interaction I knew I could use some similar jokes to hopefully put some of the people I will be taking care of at ease as well when I become a physician.  The parents then mentioned a sibling; the doctor asked if he could examine him. Upon the sibling coming in to the room, the doctor quickly explained that the disorder was genetically linked. When the brother was examined, it was obvious that the other child had pectus excavatum. The doctor informed the family of how the disorder could be treated. This situation was going to require surgery. The surgery was going to be relatively non-invasive and the doctor explained how the problem was minor in the scheme of medicine, it was now that the mother began to cry. The doctor reassured her that everything was fine. The mother said she understood that, she just said she was so thankful that the doctor had taken his time to take care of her second child whom she had not noticed needed help. It was fascinating to watch the situation unfold. The moment I saw how much this doctor had not just helped one member of a family but two, it helped to reaffirm my desire to be a physician.  \tI would eventually get to witness the physician perform the surgery that the child was told he would be undergoing that day. The surgery involved sticking a bar across the chest of the person and rotating the bar to push the sternum back into a normal position. The surgery that was done is quite rare and it was a privilege to get to see the condition before the surgery and to be a part of fixing the condition. The surgery was an hour long and I know that in that hour that surgeon helped extend that boys life when no one else there could have. In the times shadowing that Dr. Garcia, I got to see him perform multiple surgeries and I learned how important it is to appropriately talk with patients. He explained the importance of talking to parents and adult patients like theyre adults. I also noticed how he would sit down and try to get at eye level with the children to allow them to be more comfortable. I will take these lessons I learned from him and will apply them when I get the chance to practice medicine.  \tWhen I saw the attention to detail during that particular shadowing it really resonated with me because it reminded me of when I saw someone I loved receive excellent health care. Being a family member of someone sick and seeing them get tremendous assistance from the physicians made me appreciate how much I wanted to be a doctor. When I saw my grandfather in the late stages of his life getting helped and loved by everyone at the hospital and at hospice it stuck with me. The doctors who helped him at the worst point in his life were some of the greatest heroes in my life and I know that is what Dr. Garcia was for that family on the day where he helped both children. It is my ultimate goal to get to be that hero for other families out there like Dr. Garcia, the other doctors I have observed and the doctors who helped my family.  Even though observing has broadened my view of the life of a physician, I find it more enjoyable to be the one to actively help someone.  I believe the desire to help those around me is my strongest attribute. I often go to Freestore Food Bank in the Over the Rhine neighborhood which is one of the poorest areas in America. Every time I go, I get the opportunity to work with a great variety of people but some days are more memorable than others.  It was my freshmen year of college and the Foodbank was getting ready to close for the day; when a woman came up with her child and wanted to pick up just a few things. While everyone else left for the evening, the manager of the food bank and I assisted this woman and her child in collecting groceries. The woman was very friendly and kept asking about my schooling and she discovered I was nutrition major. She then began to ask questions on how to improve her health and her sons health. I answered all of her questions the best that I could as a college freshmen but she was extremely thankful for our help and my advice. Even if it was a simple task like staying open a little late, I knew I had what it takes to help people.  There is no better way to help the community than to take care of people when they are sick and at their lowest point by being a physician. That is where my desire to be a medical doctor stems from.  Food Service Tech II,  Part-Time, Freestore Foodbank The food bank is in a rough neighborhood near downtown Cincinnati. This is a place that I have volunteered for every year while I have been in college. While there I often help restock shelves with food for those who come to the food bank. I also will often run carts and help take peoples food out for them to get to take home. I have helped take in large shipments when we get large donations as well as I help clean. I will often help to bag the visitor’s groceries and try to make sure that they get as much food as their family will need. One of the more rewarding parts of volunteering there is when I help the kids and look in the back to find their favorite food if it is not out front., What's in a Doctor's Bag This group had two parts to it, the first part was to have volunteer activities that we did as a group while the second part was to read a book to younger children at their school. The volunteer activities were things like making holiday bags with crackers and little toys for children who were in the hospital during the holiday season. We also had a small group go to help serve a thanksgiving meal to those in need. The second part was to read a book titled What’s in a Doctors Bag to young kids to teach them about going to the doctor, to make it less intimidating for them to go. I was more involved with the service part of the group but I hope to help with both parts of the group this year., Donuts for Darfur This group is very effective in raising money for a good cause. I have been part of this group since I started college. It was the first group that I joined and it is one that I have stuck with the entire time. The main goal of the group is to host bake good sales in attempts to raise money for refugees that had been displaced by the conflict that is still occurring in the Darfur region of Sudan. The group is not involved politically. The main goal was to raise money to buy solar cookers for the people who have been stuck in refugee camps and this done by sales done on campus. Every thirty dollars we have been able to raise we get to send a solar cooker to the camps that are located in Chad., Recreational Sports This is a group that took place on campus that I have been involved with since fall of my freshmen year. The same group of friends has stuck together the entire time to help create recreational football team. We play about ten games a year depending on how far we go into the playoffs. We had successful year the past season before eventually losing in the semi-finals in a tournament of 64 teams. I was in charge of signing up the team to play recreational football this past year and I plan to be the one to sign the team up and collect the money this year. This particular group has not been a lot of work but it has provided me with a lot of fun and a way to make some lasting friendships., Interfaith Hospitability Network This is an organization which I have enjoyed working with. Every other month a small group of homeless people in the city of Cincinnati are brought into our church and for a week we help provide meals and place for them to sleep at nights and assist in finding them jobs.  I would typically help with the setup of the visitors rooms by setting up beds and providing them with needed items like an alarm clock and night light for kids. When the week was done I would help with tear down by putting all the beds and other items into storage to be used for next time., Choose Ohio First Scholarship This is not the only scholarship I received but it was the one I was most involved with. This scholarship had multiple meetings each semester and we got to here from panels of health care workers. We also were given the chance to meet with other medical students and students of other professional schools. I got to carry on multiple conversations with doctors because of this scholarship which included a doctor in family medicine, neurosurgeon, endocrinologist and many more. We also were able to watch a film on amnesia and then had a discussion on the course of action of all the different workers involved in the case. There were many case studies over three years and I enjoyed them all., Village Life This organization helps fund building hospitals and sending health care personnel to Tanzania. I helped on a couple occasions with setting up for fundraisers to help raise money for the organization. This included putting together baskets that would be raffled off at various fundraisers. I also got the chance to serve dinner for a fundraiser and also was able to work the silent auction where they sold off various items from Africa. I enjoyed not only helping raise money for them but they often have animals brought in from the zoo that we can play with at fundraisers. I have enjoyed helping this organization and maybe later I can go to Tanzania myself and assist them in that way., Physician Shadowing This was an experience that I will definitely continue. I got to see cultures grown in an immunology lab. I got to see a minor and a few major surgeries as well. I was able to go around on rounds with the doctor and I got to see how physicians interact with their patients during clinic hours. I got to small cists removed and I got see how the doctor would lighten the mood as either he or the nurse would be removing them. I also learned from one of the physicians about how important it is to preach a healthy lifestyle as opposed to just prescribing drugs or performing a surgery. He explained that so many of the problems that we face in America could be fixed with a proper diet and exercise., TriHealth This was my job that I held during undergrad. The most exciting part of my job was getting to work alongside our dietitian. I was able to help her with many various tasks and was always able to pick her brain, to talk about best ways to handle patients. I got to perform cooking demos, where we would show people who were going through rehab and others who were gym members how to prepare healthy meals. I was able to assist in planning of healthy menus for people and got to work on our nutrition display. The nutrition display was set up to address specific areas of concern in the field of nutrition, so we could teach those at the facility about the importance of eating correctly., Entertrainment Junction-Part Time Employee This was my job that I started when I was a sophomore in high school and continued to do in my freshmen year of college. I was able to help construct the world’s largest indoor train display. When construction was done I was able to work in the café area preparing food and cleaning. I also worked the children’s rides that were available as well as I worked in the gift shop and sold tickets. I was one of the few employees that was trained to do every position at my job and because of that I got to work on many different projects and gained a lot of experience. It was my first job and I learned how to properly treat guests and how to handle tough work situations."

    "text": "Daylight increasingly filled my sisters bedroom on this normal August summer day. The morning became suddenly abnormal as I left the sibling sleepover to use the bathroom, only to be intercepted by a police officer. He politely guided me back into my sisters bedroom and told me to wait inside for a while. Speculation was a natural response, but when Casey guessed that perhaps our father had died in the night, Hillary and I snapped back at her, unwilling to even consider the possibility. My moms eventual confirmation of his death brought a million thoughts racing to my head, but one dominated: who will take care of me Nothing can prepare you for losing a parent, and as a nine-year-old, I learned that I was unprepared to be the man of the house. I was, in a word, dependent.   The young man I would become depended almost entirely on how I would respond to my fathers sudden fatal heart attack, and instead of mustering my own strength, I became totally dependent. I relied heavily on my strong mother, the caring environment of my school, and my God to usher me through a difficult time. Having come through those tough years, I have had time to consider the concept of human dependence. People, in the most difficult of times, depend on the strong around them to hold them up. They depend on the rhythmic beating of their hearts to keep them alive, and they depend on the expertise of professionals to teach them and do for them what they could not normally teach or do for themselves. Thus far, I had been only the dependent. But I realized that I wanted to be more. I wanted to be the dependable.  A plethora of career paths would result in my becoming a dependable professional, and very few of those options were eliminated before entering college. For want of direction I decided to pursue studies in the most interesting field I knew - biological sciences. However, the summer breaks in my studies afforded two shadowing opportunities which motivated me for a medical career more than I had anticipated.   Initially, I had the privilege of shadowing New Jersey pediatrician Dr. Michael Bleiman. With Dr. Mike, I was able to observe how a pediatrician can treat holistically. Shadowing him showed me that I could bring healing through laughter and deeper restoration by being understanding and emotionally supportive to the parents of the children. Most importantly, Dr. Mike showed me that being a doctor means not only being a dependable, but being an empowerer. He treated the children as mature decision-makers and actually educated them on the causes and treatments of their illness. This was a totally new concept to me, but his point was clear: empower the dependent to promote their own well-being. My views on holistic health care were immensely broadened that year. Shadowing Dr. Mike excited me to aid people in every way that I could, by being funny, compassionate, knowledgeable, capable and loving.    An opposite experience with a New York cardiologist provided a different experience altogether. Dr. Cox was passionate about his practice and his field of study but not the people who bore the hearts he treated. During my visits I was able to see plenty of stress tests and post-cardiac episode consultations  exams by their very nature distressing to patients. In response to his patients Dr. Cox was, in short, emotionally distant. His short attention span on addressing patient concerns and interruptions of patient symptom descriptions communicated lack of compassion such that his office space felt heavy and uninviting. Dr. Cox clearly loved cardiology, but his practice taught me that health care requires more than able clinicians (though it certainly does need that). It needs clinicians who realize the weight of their position of leadership. Dr. Cox showed me that patients are not only dependent, but vulnerable. Throughout my whole time shadowing I had to resist the urge to be the emotional support these people needed in a clinician. I knew then that I wanted only to be a trustworthy physician  clinically and emotionally.  Now fueled with a philosophical and emotional fire, I was excited to continue my studies toward medicine, but it was not until my mother showed signs of depression that I realized my intellectual commitment to pursuing medicine. The combination of delayed grieving over her husbands death, breast cancer, and work pressure reared the ugliest monster my mother had yet to face. When symptoms barely declined after several changes of prescriptions and one memory-impairing ECT treatment I wept in frustration at my mothers treatment. I personally discovered amidst her battle that this field was looking for innovative thinkers, and I was going to be a physician counted amongst them.  Little can prepare you for losing a parent, but I was prepared through it to be a dependable professional. I am eager to empower the dependent like so many have done for me already, and I am eager to support the vulnerable who too seldom find a support in their physician. I commit myself to outstanding practice, and at all times, I will remember that God is the strength of my heart and without Him, I can do nothing. Youth for Christ in Belfast NY (Belfast, NY is a small impoverished town containing some of the most resilient teenagers I have ever met.) Helped to run a club which always includes a slew of games, a snack time, and a message time. Planned special events, including: all-nighters, college campus gym nights, movie nights, and breakfasts. Attended the kids' events like sporting events, plays, and parades. Elected to be the president of the Youth For Christ club on campus for 2013-14 and helped delegate the clubs in other NY towns. Organized a free clothing drive for the kids from the piles of abandoned college student clothing., Genetics and Biology Teaching Assistance As a student currently enrolled in the genetics course, I responded to the need for a TA. I learned the material ahead of time so that I could assist my own lab section as well as aid the next day's section. I aided the same professor's Gen Bio class where responsibilities were similar but also included grading.  This was a valuable experience for the very fact that I was inexperienced. Learning a skill or concept just before my peers and then claiming to be a leader in the lab setting was uncomfortable, but formative for my leadership and confidence skills. As a doctor, I believe this experience will serve me well in both confidently performing new skills and admitting when I feel unable., Science Honors Award Ceremony Each semester, one student from each class is selected for special recognition in each of the sciences. I was awarded with the sophomore biology award. In the same ceremony, students and donors are recognized for the scholarships that are awarded to the science students. Myself and three other students were recognized for receiving the 4-year Arvis and Mavis Tucker Scholarship for select students who are pursuing medicine., Baker's Acres Maintenance Every summer from 2008 through 2011, I worked at a recreational campground in southern NJ. The hard labor helped me to understand that my physical limits were high enough to carry me through intense rotations while remaining level-headed.  Additionally, weekend activities confirmed my interest in working with children. Most importantly, the job exposed me to working for and with people whose philosophical and religious views were vastly different from each other's and, in many cases, my own. Conversations with such varied personalities taught me that in both a professional and a casual relationship, mutual respect and sincere care establish firmer common ground than shared opinion., Genetics and Organic Chemistry TA Fall of 2013, I aided a new genetics professor in her first teaching position. This was very hands on with the professor and student since the TA's were the most experienced with lab equipment. This experience will indeed help me as a physician to be a team-oriented follower even if I find the leader unqualified and gave me practice in professionally handling emotionally-charged conversations with students.   In Spring '14, I TA'd for OrgChem lab section. This position gave me opportunity to calm stressed students and encourage level-headed lab techniques. One of the students with a learning disability increased my patience and encouraging abilities as a leader in high-stress situations., Global Christian Fellowship Global Christian Fellowship is a club which met weekly for music worship and to engage in discussion about the Christian church around the world.  I served on the cabinet for my first three years as 1) advertisement 2) fund-raiser 3) president of the club 4) fund-raiser.   This experience taught me organizational skills, especially as they pertained to the campus-wide Faculty Talent Show event. I gained abundant practice with electronic and face-to-face communication, coordinated with sport groups and music department for partnership in cooperation. I learned teamwork and delegation skills that will certainly serve well as a physician., Bread for the World Hunger Conference June 7th through June 12th, Bread for the World hosted a conference for around 200 people to address the issues of world hunger and addressed even more specifically the issue of SNAP (Food Stamps) benefit cuts in the Farm Bill. With 5 other students, I attended large sessions discussing the effectiveness of these Federal programs and became prepared to participate in Lobby Day on June 11th. I personally met with aids from Congress staff from VT and NY to discuss the issues of hunger. I also attended seminars addressing malnutrition in pregnancy and early childhood, gaining knowledge on how best to educated on nutrition and which organizations to join in that effort.,  Laboratory Assistant, London Honors Study Abroad Program London Honors was a first-year honors program on which I, 3 professors, and 24 other students spent the spring term in London studying western civilization. Responsibilities included daily readings, twice weekly plenary lecture, thrice weekly small group discussions of readings, weekly papers, and daily museum and gallery visits - about four hours each day. The London program prepared me for a career in health care by giving me the ability to clearly express myself orally, as the program was heavy on discussions on philosophical reading material. I believe that I can concisely convey my ideas in a non-intimidating way, largely due to this program., Haplotyping and Cardiomyopathy in Propionic Acidemia Responsibilities included: carrying out PCR, sequencing reactions, genetic analysis, experimental design/optimization, electrophoresis and gel imaging.  The research was a helpful experience because of the subject and nature of the research. Putting laborious effort into a rare disease was a reminder to consider diseases which get little attention from the widespread medical community.  The limited time to complete the research increased my teamwork skills and time-management skills and grew my commitment to my goals to the loss of personal time.  The experience was difficult but developed my resolve and patience tremendously.,  Text Assistant, Calculus and French Tutuoring The two main students I tutored presented different challenges, but neither was a B-student who would remain unsatisfied with anything but an A. One (a brilliant graphical designer) struggled through basic math concepts but wanted a medical career, while the other (accomplished potter) retained no French vocabulary. Over the course of working with these students, I learned flexibility. I learned the value of learning an individual before presuming to know how best to help them or even communicate to them. As a physician, I hope to remember the differences that people have in processing information and that intelligence cannot be solely indicated by one's ability to think scientifically., Shadowing Dr. Michael Bleiman This experience was my first exposure to what happens outside the exam room door. I was able to follow Dr. Mike into every exam room and be familiarized with the diagnostic process. I was also able to watch how a pediatrician balances the careful interaction with an overly concerned or unconcerned parent. He also dotted the time between exams with quizzes of symptoms and diagnoses. Extra time between exams was filled with my questions about socialized health care and  Dr. Mike's philosophy of vaccination risk. Shadowing this quirky physician showed me that professionalism can coexist delightfully with personability to improve the exam-room experience., Urbana Missions Conference Urbana was a Conference of about 16000 Christians to encourage and equip for the task of spreading the good news of Jesus Christ throughout the world. The conference included morning Bible study, music, large group sessions or sermons from world missions leaders, twice daily seminars, and an auditorium filled with over 300 humanitarian and religious organizations. Seminars attended included: Suffering and Faith, Simple Living for Just Giving about spending and giving money wisely, AIDS in Francophone Africa, and God's Call to the Healthcare Professional led by Christian Medical and Dental Association. Urbana also focused on food and led me to discover a passion for fighting malnutrition., South Dakota Reservations Trip Visited Rosebud and Cherry Creek Reservations where we served hot meals and distributed clothing from the team's clothing drive supply. I assisted  Lakota-style Christian worship services by playing keyboard, sharing my experience about losing a father, and performing in 2 dramas. Construction work was done on a community center in Rapid City.  This experience was the most humbling culture experiences I have had. The exposure to poverty on the reservations re-enervated my desire for giving care to underprivileged peoples. I personally learned to focus on my cultural sensitivity and was able to learn from our leader good refocusing techniques for teams as large and diverse as ours., Elderly Care at Hutton Household Weekly, I arrived at the Hutton's home to aide Mr. Hutton, a 90-yr-old man with advanced Alzheimer's. I woke him and fed him various blended meals. I also aided occasionally in blending the meals and cleaning up. After dinner, I would prepare his medication by adding it to ice cream and feeding that to him. I would then assist his bed routine by walking him with Becky to the bathroom, wiping him, and changing his diaper, then lowering him into bed., London Volunteering While studying in London, I volunteered for two efforts of the same church. Weekly I served meals to a largely food-insecure population of London who attended a study of the Bible  Easter week in March, I assisted in a children's program at a satellite site, leading the kids from one activity to another and aiding in childcare after the program.  These experiences were personally transforming in one specific way - they were a reminder of how vast some problems are. As I enter health care, I will be a physician who considers his part as a small contribution but a vital contribution nonetheless. I will serve humbly but enthusiastically for change."

    "text": "I couldnt believe my eyes. As one surgeon forcefully widened the hole that had just been expertly sliced open, the other surgeon gave a yank on something inside the opening and emerged with a tiny purplish baby girl. Es una chica, the pediatrician happily announced as she whisked the infant to a table and immediately set to wiping her down. I exhaled, realizing that I had been holding my breath until I heard the tiny squeals of a new life. As fascinating as it was to watch the surgeons cinch the tissue back together, I couldnt help but peer over the shoulder of the pediatrician to wonder at the beautiful wrinkled face.  I have not forgotten the beauty, resilience, and complexity of the human body that awed me in that operating room in Bolivia. In my favorite studio art class, we studied and drew one part of the body at a timefirst the bones, then the muscles and ligaments  we could only draw the skin after we understood the structure and function that informed every beautiful curve of the human form. I was equally intrigued by the dynamic lines and shapes in malaria-infected red blood cells as I was learning about the parasites lifecycle when I studied microscope slides for a piece in my senior art exhibit. I have always been fascinated by the beauty of human life and the intricacies of the body, which is one of many reasons why I am pursuing a career in medicine.  Another is the deep burden I have to address the need for medical care in many regions of the world, including rural America. I first experienced poverty and deficient healthcare in eighth grade during a mission trip to Oaxaca, Mexico with a medical team from my church, including my mother, a pediatrician. We joined Dr. Zamacona, a physician in Oaxaca, on the arduous trip he made monthlytraveling high into the mountains above the city to set up clinics in several remote villages. Since the medical team wouldnt allow me to treat patients, I assisted them by performing small tasks in the clinic, passing out toothbrushes, and keeping the patients children entertained. All day long I watched as a never-ending stream of people desperate for medical attention flowed into the clinic. I was shaken by their physical deformities and intense suffering, most of which I learned was what happens when normally curable ailments go untreated for months and years. Though we could only offer them a few generic medications and limited antibiotics, I have never forgotten the hope and gratitude that filled their eyes as they thanked us for coming.  Several years later I spent a month with Hospitals of Hope at their hospital and various orphanages in Bolivia, where I gained a deeper understanding of the widespread issue of healthcare inequality. Becoming a doctor would not resolve this egregious disparity, but at least in doing so, I could make a difference in the lives of a few, as exemplified by Dr. Zamacona and Dr. Alvarez, a Bolivian physician to the Yuqui tribe. I met Dr. Alvarez when my team from Hospitals of Hope spent a few days with the Yuquis in their village in the Amazon basin. To reach it, we had to travel several hours, including segments of canoeing and hiking through the jungle. For 15 days of every month, Dr. Alvarez works out of a small medical office funded by USAID in their village, which lacked electricity and running water.  By contrast, I am blessed to live in a region of the United States with excellent healthcare, even by Americas high standards. Furthermore, growing up with a pediatrician for a mother was a twofold blessing: I always knew that I had someone who could take care of me, and I was able to see the reward of applying medical knowledge in everyday situations. One day in particular, my family was hiking at a park when we came across a frightened dad and his four-year-old son, who had fallen and broken his leg. My mom fashioned a makeshift splint and calmed them while we waited for the ambulance.  My mom and the physicians Ive shadowed have modeled the unique position a doctor has to exhibit care, compassion, and hope to their patients. This requires a personable and empathetic personality, which I believe God has cultivated in me through many different experiences: mentoring young teenagers at Campus Life in one of the poorest counties of New York; feeding and cleaning a sweet elderly man with severe Alzheimers; and corresponding by letters in Spanish with two children I personally sponsor through Compassion International. I even had the incredible privilege of spending a day with Saulo, my sponsored child from Bolivia, seeing firsthand how my support enabled him to have a better life.  My call to medicine is well summarized by Frederick Buechners definition of vocation: The place God calls you to is where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet. That intersection between my own joy and the worlds needs is a place I hope to find as a physician. In conjunction with the empathy and patience I know I can only maintain with Jesus Christ as my role model and strength, I want to equip myself to bring comfort and healing to those in need through medicine by the amazing grace of God. Art Scholarship and Magna Cum Laude After a portfolio review of art I had made in high school, I was awarded an Art Performance Scholarship of $20,000 for the four years, which enabled me to study at Houghton as an art major.  I graduated with Magna Cum Laude honors by maintaining a cumulative G.P.A. of over 3.70., Campus Life club leader Campus Life is a ministry of Youth For Christ geared towards middle school and high school aged youth. I was a volunteer leader of the program that lasted about 2 hours every Monday night. Our goal was to build healthy relationships with the 8-15 youth that came regularly through games and by preparing messages to encourage them to make good choices, establish a solid foundation for life, and positively impact their schools. Most of the youth are very poor, have a rough home life, do poorly in school, and struggle with depression and behavioral issues., Visit Office Intern and Tour Guide During the spring of 2011, I primarily escorted high school students and their families on informative tours of the campus. During the next two school years, I corresponded with the prospective students and their parents, college faculty, and current students to arrange visit activities. I also answered questions from the visiting students as a member of current student panels. I accomplished various office duties including proofing, managing databases, and designing literature for Admissions and Visit Office events., Global Christian Fellowship Club Leader Global Christian Fellowship is a club at Houghton College with the mission of promoting global awareness and action on campus. Throughout college, I attended nearly every weekly meeting. During my junior year, I was on the cabinet and provided snack for the meetings. As part of the cabinet, we met weekly to plan the club meetings and fundraisers for student summer missions scholarships. Senior year I was Vice President and contacted potential speakers (professors, missionaries, and mission organization representatives) for every Wednesday club meeting. I also helped to plan and advertise for Houghton College's global mission conference, New Vision Week, in 2011., Hospitals of Hope Experience in Bolivia Hospitals of Hope (HOH) is a Christian medical missions organization based in Kansas with hospitals in Bolivia, Liberia, and Haiti. I traveled by myself to Cochabamba and stayed for a month at a guest house on the Bolivian hospital's premises with other U.S. volunteers. Every morning started with rounds in the hospital, as I tried to translate for the other volunteers. Then I shadowed a doctor, a different specialty each day- pediatrics, OB/GYN, orthopedics, internal medicine, ER, and a physical therapist. I scrubbed in and observed six surgeries while I was there. In the evenings and on weekends the HOH volunteers and I helped at orphanages and gave health presentations to children., Spanish Teaching Assistant I assisted Senor Kinman in some of his introductory Spanish classes by facilitating small-group discussions and helping him lead classroom activities. I also graded tests and homework and tutored students., Elderly Care for the Huttons I helped Becky Hutton take care of her 90-year-old parents with dementia, Lindol and Ruth. I prepared Lindol's meals and spoon-fed him, as he had lost nearly all his faculties due to severe Alzheimer's. Becky and I used a patient lift to transport Lindol from his chair to the toilet and bed. I wiped him, changed his diaper, and administered eyedrops. I also stayed overnight twice to help Ruth Hutton out of bed to use the bathroom and then re-situate her using pillows to correct her posture. I learned to sleep lightly, always ready to patiently and compassionately help her when she needed something, as she usually woke up confused and in pain., Nanny I provided care for two children, who were 1 and 6 years old the first summer, for three full days every week. My duties included planning activities, preparing meals, discipline, and tutoring the 6-year-old in reading and math. This job provided a formative opportunity to become a dependable adult. With two young children in my charge, situations arose everyday in which I was required to make the best decision regarding the children's safety, health, and character development. Additionally I was held accountable by reporting daily to Laurie. Last summer added the challenge of providing emotional support when their father, Ray, passed away tragically in October 2011., Cardiology Observation I spent four full days with Dr. Cox, observing pharmacological and physical stress tests, echocardiograms (including transesophageal), cardioversions, and new consult and follow-up appointments., Lakota Sioux Service Trip I spent the 9-day February break of my sophomore and junior years at Houghton College with several other college students, my physics professor and his wife, and Pastor Todd in South Dakota with Lakota Sioux Native Americans. During both trips, we joined Pastors Larry and Dale Salway of He Sapa New Life Wesleyan Church based in Rapid City, SD, in their ministry to Cherry Creek and Rosebud Reservations. We cooked a meal for the impoverished people living on the Reservations, distributed clothes and toys, and presented the gospel to them by leading worship music, performing skits, and sharing our testimonies. I also helped organize the clothing drive at Houghton College before the trips., East Meets West Honors Program I was invited to apply to Houghton's honors programs and was accepted after an interview in January 2009. I was also awarded Houghton's Presidential Scholarship of $10,000 per year. The honors program consisted of 12 credits during spring semester and a 3-credit, 3-week Mayterm trip to the Balkans in 2010. The program traces the development of Western culture from antiquity through the twentieth century by focusing on the West's relationship with Eastern Europe and the Middle East. We were expected to read about 90 pages per night and write several papers of 5-10 pages throughout the semester and Mayterm. The integrative course included Literature, Political Science, History, and Theology., Grapevine RNA Virus Collaborative Research with Dr. Potter In collaboration with Dr. Keith Perry at Cornell University, our research focused on Grapevine leaf roll-associated viruses, GLRaV, in Vitis vinifera through collection and analysis of plant samples from western New York vineyards and adjacent wild cultivars using newly-developed molecular macroarray diagnostic techniques. I collected virally-infected vine samples from vineyards, prepared agarose gels, performed gel electrophoresis, analyzed the gel with a molecular imager, extracted RNA from phloem of grapevine canes, performed reverse-transcription PCR and standard PCR, purified amplified DNA with Qiagen columns, hybridized macroarray membranes, and developed x-ray films., Lifeguard Pilgrim Village Lake is a small, neighborhood lake with a beachfront recreation area. Maintaining a safe swimming area required careful surveillance, watching for any unsafe or distressed behavior, and determining the proper action to take. I assessed injured individuals and administered first aid. I learned the importance of being reliable, mature, and courteous with the patrons in order to gain their trust., General Chemistry Laboratory Assistant Supervised General Chemistry students to ensure safe and proper laboratory technique. Graded lab write-ups and assisted students with questions regarding the lab., Plastic Surgery, Pediatrics, and OB/GYN Observation Through my mom's connections at University Hospitals, where she is employed, I have been able to contact and shadow a few physicians. In 2011, I shadowed Dr. Haruko Okada (email hco@case.edu) and Dr. Hooman Soltanian for 2 days in plastic and reconstructive surgery. I observed a double mastectomy reconstructive surgery and saw pre-op. and post-op. patients. In 2012, I shadowed my mom (Laura Mason) at the UH Geauga Medical Center in Chardon, OH. I rounded with her in the neonatal unit of the hospital and also saw a circumcision. This summer I am going to shadow Dr. Lori Mullen in obstetrics/gynecology."

    "text": "My family has always had a large impact on my goals and decisions, so when it came time to choose a career path, they were very much involved. They have been my biggest supporters and I attribute many of my strengths to my upbringing. My first lessons in life taught me about who I am and where my family has come from. My fathers family is Native Hawaiian; many of them live on the islands, visiting allows me the opportunity to be engulfed in the culture. Lei making, language and hula dancing were a few things I was taught at a young age. To further my education of my ancestry, I was fortunate enough to attend Kamehamehas HoomaikaikaiI summer exploration program; a tradition that has been in our family for generations.  My mother, who is of Mexican descent, along with the rest of our family have passed on many traditions. My favorite tradition is when we make homemade tamales and empanadas around Christmas to donate to local churches. These traditions helped mold me into who I am and still benefit me to this day; serving as reminders to be strong, have compassion for others and to be determined. These qualities are essential to achieve my ambitions of being a doctor.   I find great joy in giving back to the world that has blessed me with so much. One of the most rewarding experiences I have had was traveling abroad to volunteer in Southern Africa. While there, I witnessed poverty levels far below anything I have ever seen or imagined. The native people had almost nothing, yet they were the happiest and most grateful individuals I have ever had the privilege to work with. This sense of humility was eye opening; a lesson in life that no textbook can teach. Giving back to my local communities through volunteer work is something I thoroughly enjoy. Much of my work is done at the Shalom Free Clinic, which gives the uninsured population of Butte County an opportunity to consult health professionals. The clinic allows me to shadow health professionals and get hands-on experience by taking vitals and registration. The most rewarding part, is that I can personally consult patients one-on-one, lending an ear to those in need. Often, I have found listening is enough to help someone begin the healing process.   I feel that my innate sense of altruism, accompanied with the enjoyment I get from learning is what sparked my interest in medicine at such a young age. I have always been captivated by how the world works. Every explanation given to me as a child was met with a response, But why I wanted to know every detail of what I observed in the world. For years I remained unsatisfied by the typical reply, Thats just the way it is, Kara! One day my grandmother finally said to me, Research it! and that is exactly what I did. I spent hours reading and soaking up as much information as my mind could absorb a skill that has benefitted me throughout my life.  My true love for medicine came when I was nine years old. I became ill with Meningitis and was quarantined in ICU for 10 days. My visitors were limited, so the nurses and doctors who surrounded me, became victims of my constant questioning. I asked about everything they did. Luckily they were patient, seeing my passion to learn. This new insight of information left me hungry to learn more. During the following years I returned to the hospital a few more times for minor injuries. The spark that ignited when I was nine was now a raging wild fire, I knew medicine was what I wanted to do.    During college I had the opportunity to shadow Dr. Rex Moulton-Barrett, a board certified Otolaryngologist and reconstruction surgeon. If there was any doubt in my mind about becoming a doctor it was quickly shattered as I worked beside him and became more familiar with medicine. Every day I found myself becoming more intrigued as I observed him in both the clinical setting and in the operating room. I gained great insight as him and I researched the effects of turbinate resection in patients, and I became the first author of the manuscript that is in preparation for publication. Prior to working with him, I hadnt put much thought into other aspects of the medical field. Things like billing information and insurance are moving parts that I hadnt been exposed to before. Dr. Moulton-Barrett showed me what it takes to be a great doctor, both inside and outside of the examining room.   I also have had the opportunity to educate, a skill I have become very comfortable with. Whether teaching school kids in a lab, volunteering at a preschool, tutoring struggling high school students or educating patients at Shalom about healthy living, educating others has played a major role in my life and my interest in medicine. I believe the best way to help a person is to teach them, and in medicine patient education is key to a successful recovery.   Working directly with physicians, helping others, and remaining diligent with regard to my studies have kept me enthusiastic about medicine. I have always been interested by all sciences and as I continue to pursue my dream I am reminded that medicine encompasses every end of the science spectrum while benefiting the lives of others.  The medical field never ceases to amaze me and I know it is the right path for me. BloodSource Student Director BloodSource is a non-profit blood bank and donation site that I had the opportunity to intern for. My title was Student Director and it was my responsibility to coordinate blood drives at my campus. I worked directly with the management at BloodSource to find campus organizations to host drives and help promote the event. This internship helped me better many skills, but in particular my communication and organization skills. I was constantly communicating back and forth with BloodSource and students, scheduling meetings and arranging blood drive events., Clark Porter Biological Science Scholarship Clark Porter is a 1948 biological science alumni from CSU Chico. Now, a retired senior scientist from Monsanto, he gives back to the college by donating scholarship funds. This honor is awarded to one student that has excelled in biology classes and is part of the biological honor society, Omicron. Myself, being very involved in Omicron and maintaining an above average GPA, was granted the award for the 2012-2013 academic school year., CAVE Community Action Volunteer in Education (CAVE) is a student-led, non-profit volunteer organization serving the Chico campus since 1966. My time volunteering for CAVE was in the tutorial program. This program brought in students from kindergarten to 12th grade that needed extra help with their studies. I worked mostly with high school students in subjects such as math, chemistry and biology. I met with students twice a week and answered questions and improved study habits. After 15 weeks there was improvement in the students' test grades and greater understanding of the material. It was very rewarding to see students excel and become motivated to learn., Golden Key International Honor Society Golden Key is an international honor society with over 400 chapters. Invitation into the club requires being part of the top 15% of one's class and an interest in community outreach. I have been an active member in Golden Key sense 2010, and it has given me many opportunities to volunteer in the Chico community. Being a member has also exposed me to great resources that has helped me succeed in my college career., Long Distant Races I have always used exercise as a way to relieve stress, clear my mind and stay healthy. Once I finished my basketball and softball career I picked up running as a stress release. At first it was only a way to clear my thoughts, but quickly I realized it was an opportunity to help others. Two races I participated in, directly helped raise funds for awareness against drunk driving. The Run 4 Recovery and the Kristina Chesterman Race was dedicated to two nursing students at Chico State that were hit and injured/killed by drunk drivers. Running has allowed me to fulfill two of my passions simultaneously., Clinical and Surgical observation with Moulton-Barrett I was able to shadow Dr. Moulton-Barrett in a clinical setting watching closely as he interacted and diagnosed patients. In the operating room I observed as he preformed a broad range of surgeries from turbinate resection to abdominal plasty. Dr. Moulton-Barrett taught me a lot about the business side of medicine as he informed me about billing and insurance procedures and much more. After working with Dr. Moulton-Barrett I have become more comfortable in all medical settings and eager to continue my pursuit in medicine., Harvest Laboratory Technician I was hired at, Trinchero Family Estates', Sutter Home Winery, as a seasonal, Harvest Laboratory Technician. Analytical chemistry techniques were employed to determine what state the wine was in and what action was needed to complete the process. Working at the winery allowed me to better my laboratory skills and also taught me a lot about enology., South Africa Volunteer Work In 2012 I had the opportunity to travel to Southern Africa, with International Student Volunteer (ISV) to work with underprivileged children and families. Our efforts went to developing a school to give the young students a better educational foundation that could hopefully lead them to continue their education and break the poverty cycle. Three new classrooms were added to the school to accommodate each grade level and allow for teachers to focus on differing curriculums. I was emerged in the culture and learned the ways of the natives as we toured all of Southern Africa. Along the way we stopped at a Swahili orphanage where I was able to donate time to the children residing there., Investigation in Epigenetic Predisposition for Obesity In the 2013 annual, Biological Science Poster Symposium, I presented the poster titled, Comparisons of microarray data indicates high fat diets cause alterations to the epigenetic code and lead to development of obesity. Epigenetic research is a strong interest I have. For this research I looked at the inheritance patterns of altered epigenetic codes caused by high fat diets. After meta-analysis of microarray data I determined hypermethylation of one obesogenic genes was in fact passed down to offspring. The gene effected is also involved in the development of type II diabetes, another area I would like to continue research in., Role of Peroxidase Genes In the annual, Biological Poster Symposium, myself and two classmates presented the poster, Investigating the role of class III peroxidase gene AT3G21770 using PCR for YFP transfection of Arabadopsis thaliana by Agrobacterium tumafaciens. We each had equal roles in studying the expression of the peroxidase gene, and in composing a manuscript. The gene in question was tagged with YFP using PCR and amplified in an E. coli plasmid. The plasmid was then integrated into an agrobacterium plasmid and Arabidopsis plants were transfected with the bacterium. Transgenic seedlings were then grown and gene expression was localized in xylem of roots and cell wall of root tips early in development.,  Laboratory Technician, Omicron Theta Epsilon Omicron Theta Epsilon is a biology honors society at CSU Chico established in 1927. I entered into the club as an associate member in the fall of 2010. The following year I wanted to get more involved and became historian for the club where I documented events and helped to construct The Scope the clubs annual news letter. I had the privilege of being initiated in 2011 and allowed me to sit on the executive board, which I did when I was nominated and elected to be secretary. I fulfilled my duties as secretary for the 2012-2013 school year, which included note taking and being present at all Omicron events. Omicron has been a great way to get involved on campus and in the community.,  Student director, Hands on Teaching Lab The K-3 Hands on Lab experience at CSU Chico, allows teachers to bring their grade school students to campus to learn basic scientific concepts. By teaching in a hands on manner, it allows students to become more interested in science. I taught the lab for four months and had the opportunity to work with 16 groups of children. The lab improved my leadership and communication skills, traits I have been able to use in other experiences such as my time volunteering as a tutor, and at Little Discoveries Pre-School in Chico. I was able to educate and motivate students, which I believe is very important at any age, and one of the many reasons I became interested in medicine., Pre-Medical Association Secretary The Pre-Medical Association is a club on campus ran by pre-med students for pre-med students. For the past year I sat on the executive board of the Pre-Med Association as the secretary, but was also pleased to fill in where ever needed. During my time in the club I introduced new ways of publicity and raising funds for the club. As secretary it was then my job to alert members of upcoming events and official club business, such as volunteer opportunities, guest speakers and financial expenditures. Being an executive member gave me an opportunity to be a leader and learn while doing so., Clinical Turbinectomy Research The research conducted with, board certified Otolaryngology-Head and Neck surgeon, Dr. Moulton-Barrett, was aimed to determine the efficacy of resection of the middle/inferior turbinate in relieving nasal obstruction and migraine headaches, which some considered malpractice. Dr. MB was the sole surgeon in the study. My role was in conducting phone interviews with patients post-surgery to determine their success rate. I then came up with a method to quantitate their experience so I could then run various statistical analysis on the data. I am currently the first author of the manuscript titled, “Importance of Turbinectomy in Modern Clinical Practice”, which is in preparation to be published., Shalom Free Clinic The Shalom free clinic is a medical clinic in Chico California that serves the uninsured population of Butte County. It opens it doors every sunday afternoon to allow people to consult a variety of medical professionals. I volunteered at the clinic roughly twice a month and was able to broaden my knowledge of the medical field. Many tasks were medical in nature such as taking vitals and histories, and occasionally shadowing a primary care doctor, but the most rewarding part of the experience was sitting down and listening to patients as they waited. Often, all they needed was a shoulder to cry on to begin the healing process."

    "text": "As I grasped the last handful of volcanic rock on my ascent of Cerro Negro in Nicaragua, I could only think of my ragged breath and aching body. Despite the physical hurt, I felt mentally and emotionally stimulated. Eventually, I reached the top and as I sat there to catch my breath I fully understood the value of my determination and perseverance. I would have never imagined learning so much about myself on the medical mission trip in Chinandega, Nicaragua, where I thought I would be the one doing most of the teaching. My dedication to learning about and informing others of current global health situations and humanitarian efforts is the reason that I joined Raising Awareness for International Medicine (AIM) of Purdue University. After helping build water pipelines for clean water access, teaching English, and touring clinics and orphanages, I was certain of my passion to become a physician that will practice medicine internationally with the primary purpose of providing care to refugees. From a young age, medicine has interested me and I see it as the application of intellectualism to humanism, persuasion to action, and research to relevance. I believe my ability to distinguish these factors has helped me strengthen personal traits required for becoming a holistic physician. My passion for medicine was evident as a child and only grew stronger as I became old enough to volunteer and shadow at local hospitals on a weekly basis. Volunteering in the emergency room and the mother/baby unit has given me a glimpse into two different environments of medicine. There is never a dull moment and I take care of a range of situations from vomiting babies to ill inmates. I enjoy interacting with patients and assisting nurses in various tasks. Through this, I was given the opportunity to observe numerous operations ranging from cesarean sections to hernia repair surgeries.  I believe the opportunities to shadow and volunteer were a perfect blend of intellectualism to humanism and accurately expresses my strengths in both areas.  Entering college, I knew that medicine was the right path for me. After graduating high school, I had a humbling experience in Palestine where I met refugees displaced out of their homes.  Being exposed to the dire need for attainable medical and healthcare services inspired me to become a physician that provides compassionate medical care to disadvantaged members of society. This eye-opening visit introduced me to various volunteer efforts. My interest in organizations that serve the community helped strengthen my leadership qualities.  I developed and led two vital organizations on campus, the Student Alumni Association and the Red Cross Club. Both organizations strive to provide opportunities for students to volunteer and give back to the community and internationally. Through them, I was able to lead initiatives that center on informing others of global health situations and efforts ranging from CPR training courses to medical supply drives. Developing these groups allowed me to promote a diverse culture on campus that extends out to the community. From these experiences, I was able to grow as a leader and persuade others to take action and engage in altruistic efforts. I also strengthened my ability to facilitate action through persuasion, which are necessary traits for a doctor who can lead individuals and direct solutions in any situation. My desire for intellectually stimulating topics and scientific rigor inspired me to pursue independent research in Dr. Grace Munas analytical chemistry lab, where I worked specifically on electrode systems for use as estrogen sensors. My interest in developing sensors expanded into participation in an NSF-REU program at the University of Illinois. Through this experience, I worked on developing a biosensor as a diagnostic alternative for hydrocephalus with Dr. Sukhi Basati and other neurosurgeons. My first hand exposure is indicative of my skills in research and my ability to develop working theories and ideas to a given problem. My research experience will become relevant as I complement my love for medicine and research as a physician through practicing translational medicine. This will allow me to translate the very best of medical research into practical applications for my patients.  The combination of my strong desire for medicine, my experiences, and my inspirations are fundamental in molding who I am and cultivating my efforts in becoming a physician. As a physician, I will be able to translate the very best of medical research into practical applications for patient care. I will be able to effectively blend my strengths in applying intellectualism to humanism, persuasion to action, and research to relevance to provide my patients with the best possible care. I will be able to use my willingness to learn and grow as motivating elements. I will strive to work with individuals who come from underserved and rural populations that have no access to healthcare. Becoming a physician will equip me with the resources I need to offer patient-focused compassionate treatment across many borders. Bloss Scholar Being a Bloss Scholar was more than being awarded a scholarship; it was being awarded an opportunity to give back. The program was awarded based on academic merit and leadership displayed in high school, which I achieved only for my sole desire. The program was different than others because it focused on building organizations on campus/community to give back. From my mentors, I learned the significance of compassion and supporting a cause greater than oneself. I think these qualities must be recognized in order to cultivate a good physician. I value this program for teaching me this lesson and I believe it will aid me in offering compassionate care to disadvantaged members of society., Indiana University Executive Council Being one of eight elected students on the Indiana University Executive Council was a clear advantage. The council valued my opinions on enhancing the university and the alumni association. Throughout the meetings, I gained insight on how the university functions and improved my communication skills. I was also able to share ideas with physicians including Surgeon General, Adam Robinson, about developing our physician-based association. To an extent, I believe the administrative aspect of how a hospital functions is similar to a university. Being a member allowed me to gain insight on this aspect, which will provide me with greater understanding on how to more effectively treat my patients., Student Alumni Association (SAA) Being the SAA president was one of the greatest privileges. I was granted the freedom to introduce programs that I saw fit for our goals of advancing the university and engaging in activities worldwide. Therefore, I began a variety of programs from Dinner with 6 Titans, a student-mentor dinner, to collecting over 1000 pairs of shoes for Soles4Souls international distribution. SAA allowed me to lead the most talented and diverse group of students who taught me to be a more conscious listener and a stronger leader. The qualities I gained through this experience will be necessary in my role as a doctor who will be able to lead individuals and direct solutions in various situations., Research on Estrogen Ever since I was younger I gravitated towards hands-on learning, so it was no surprise when I elected to do research to expand on classroom concepts. My training focused on analytical chemistry with the objective of detecting estrogenic phenolic compounds (EPCs) with different electrodes. With dedication and persistence, our findings on EPCs using nickel-modified electrodes were published in the Journal of Electroanalysis. Most importantly, my abilities to think independently and solve problems creatively were sharpened through research. These abilities will be necessary in the field and because of my experience I will be able to apply them effectively., Chemical Rubber Company (CRC) Chemistry Awards Given the honor to be awarded with the Chemical Rubber Society Chemistry award as a freshman and Analytical Chemistry award as a junior was remarkable. The awards were much more than papers to frame- they signified my hard work, and my countless hours researching and teaching. In many ways, the awards motivated me to excel and help those around me. The recognition helped me realize my talent as a student and inspired me to share my knowledge. I began to mentor and tutor high school students in advanced coursework. The awards helped me realize an opportunity to give back; I allowed the recognition to teach me instead of to validate me, which I think is a vital characteristic to attain., Mini Medical Camp I enjoy being a role model to high school students and for that reason I have been involved with many programs throughout my campus and community to help high school students especially those aspiring to go into the healthcare field. One specific event was Mini Medical Camp, where I gave presentations to students about the medical school journey. I was able to supply them with advice and share with them the difficulties of being a pre-med student and ways to alleviate these stresses. As a student, I always wished I had a mentor that could advise me on what to do and that is why I am passionate about being there for students who need guidance., Undergraduate Research Conferences I have always enjoyed sharing information to benefit others in understanding and learning. I am passionate about teaching others and this is the primary reason why I like to share my research findings. I have participated in a number of undergraduate research conferences at Indiana University and University of Illinois where I have been able to teach students and faculty about my biosensor/electrode research development. I have been honored to receive the Seminar and Excellence in Biochemistry awards for my skills and proficiency in communicating concepts and ideas.  With this ability, I hope to inspire others to engage in research and teach others about their understandings and findings., Collective Shadowing Experiences I have shadowed numerous physicians with varying specialties. Shadowing Dr. Ali, anesthesiologist, I was able to work with many physicians and nurses who were willing to teach me new things. Shadowing neurosurgeon Dr. Haridas was an exciting field where I observed complex operations of the brain and spine. Dr. Salous, family physician, was interesting because he would let me interact with patients. He would also sit with me between appointments and explain the diagnosis of each patient and ask me to predict possible treatments as a way to think abstractly. Along with other physicians, I feel each was a learning experience that confirmed that medicine was the right field for me., Awareness for International Medicine (AIM) I participated in the service trip of AIM because I have an interest in international healthcare. My goal as physician is to raise awareness of the healthcare situation in underdeveloped nations. We worked in rural Chinandega, Nicaragua to promote development in water and sanitation and healthcare.  We worked with villagers to improve their quality of life while teaching them methods to be self-sufficient. The trip was a life changing experience that offered me an opportunity to inspire and impact others. The villagers helped me to realize the importance of being determined and passionate about achieving a goal. This trip taught me so much and I look forward to going again., NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates My love for medicine and research were well combined as an REU at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). My research entailed developing a biosensor as a diagnostic alternative for hydrocephalus. I worked with neurosurgeons to understand the overall aim of the department and to gain insight on what direction to take. I was able to gain exposure in neurosurgery and bioengineering in a hands-on, applied setting that I enjoyed. During this experience I improved my ability to communicate my ideas and critically think through obstacles. The development of the biosensor will be published in the near future because of its potential to be optimized and used as part of a point of care system., IUSB Healthcare Alliance My passion for mentoring others is the primary reason that I began the Healthcare Alliance. The primary goal of this organization was to spread awareness on how to engage in altruistic efforts and advocacy and to provide resources to pre-healthcare students.  Our organization focused on developing programs that students can utilize to help them succeed in classes. Many of these programs were beneficial especially to students who came from diverse backgrounds. Our goal was to help these students push through obstacles and provide them the support and guidance they needed.  Ultimately, our club helped the students grow and allowed them ways to give back to their community., Optician at Dr. Garcia & Associates The most unique aspect of my role as an optician was to interact with the patients and understand how to address their situation. My dynamic role consisted of pre-testing patients and completing insurance and related paperwork. Pre-testing patients included checking visual acuities, retinal imaging, and checking for basic eye health. I learned more than what was expected as an optician because of my desire to help patients. Often, I taught patients how to wear and remove contacts. At times, I would have to place the contacts in for the patients. I ultimately enjoyed how each patient brought a new aspect into practice and my ability to learn from each patient., Memorial Hospital Volunteer Volunteering in both the emergency room and the mother/baby unit was great exposure to two different fields. The ER was a fast pace environment where I assisted the triage nurses, comforted family and patients during unexpected situation and interacted with ER doctors and staff. There was never a dull moment and I took care of a range of problems and people from vomiting babies to ill inmates. In contrast, the mother/baby unit was a calm environment where I helped comfort mothers, tend to the newborns, and restock rooms. The serene environment gave me the ability to connect with patients and engage in my surroundings. Both were opportunities to improve varying traits I need as a physician., Red Cross Volunteer Working in the Refugee Department was one of the most rewarding life experiences, despite only participating short term. I was able to work with refugee families from Iraq and helped as a translator and English teacher to the family children. I vividly remember seeing the faces of the children glow as they learned a new word and it was amazing to see them progress. The ultimate goal was to help situate the families and aid them in their assimilation to American customs. I was delighted to spend time with the children, including accompanying them from grocery shopping trips to doctor appointments. I honestly learned more about myself through this experience then I was able to teach them."

    "text": "Steve Jobs, the former CEO of Apple, Inc. was one of the most respected leaders of the business world. He was a particular hero of mine when I was becoming an accountant. It is natural to emulate those who have succeeded before us. Steve Jobs was the epitome of business success. Ironically, the words of this corporate genius now resonate most with my decision to leave the corporate world behind. He said, Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is truly great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. With all of his knowledge of economics and management strategy, the key to his success was simply satisfying his heart. My childhood began with regular lessons in compassion. I attended Catholic schools through high school and into college. These schools required hundreds of community service hours to graduate, so I grew to know the faces of the sick and the poor. Servitude was built into my education. Helping others was also prominent at home. Growing up, I was surrounded by health care professionals. My father was an OB/GYN, and his father, a surgeon, was the Deputy Minister of Health for the Philippines. My mother met my father during his residency in Chicago while she worked as a registered nurse. It seems to fit family tradition that I am now applying to medical school. Caring for others is in my blood. However, my path to medical school has been far from traditional. In spite of my parents' wishes, I chose to pursue a career with an accounting firm. The business world offered steady hours while stimulating my analytical and competitive sides. As a former college athlete, I saw the corporate ladder as yet another competition and dedicated myself to climbing to the top. I traveled across the U.S. consulting with all types of industries. Each business had puzzle pieces to be placed in a more profitable arrangement. My job offered challenges and opportunities to advance, but as time passed I knew that something was missing. I had more to offer the world. Part of my job was to interview employees to assess their role in a company's finances, so I began to picture myself in their shoes whenever I traveled. I hoped to find that missing piece, but none of their careers seemed to fit. My wife noted that I seemed happiest when I was coaching high school soccer after work. However, a career as a high school soccer coach was not going to pay my loans, so I decided to tough it out and hope the feeling would pass. Later that year I had my annual physical exam, and out of habit I asked my doctor about the business processes in his clinic. As I asked about ways to improve profits, I was shocked by his responses. After each of my suggestions to reduce his costs, he responded yes, but that would lower the quality of patient care. As I left the clinic I realized what had been missing from my career. Financial consultants are trained to focus on profitability above everything else. While I kept emotions out of the office, physicians needed emotion to provide quality patient care. Similarly, emotion was a part of my job as a soccer coach. Caring about my players made me a better coach, but it also made me much happier to finally utilize my compassion. Later that month, I took a day off to shadow a primary care physician specializing in endocrinology. We saw a middle-aged woman who had lost her mother to breast cancer. She was clearly anxious when she explained she too had found a small lump on her breast. The fear in her eyes made me uncomfortable. When the physician assured her she had nothing to worry about, I could see that fear dissipate. This woman trusted his advice with a life-threatening problem, and he responded to her concern with delicate sincerity. I realized physicians are challenged intellectually, but they also have the opportunity to improve people's lives. That is what I had been missing. Now I was faced with one of the most difficult decisions of my life. I had studied for years to get a stable job with good pay and benefits. If I left my job behind, there was still no guarantee that I would end up a physician. I had already paid for college once, and medical school would be even more expensive. My accounting instincts waved bright red flags in my head, declaring this decision financial suicide. After weeks of psychological civil war, I chose to pursue my dream and never looked back. Each day I spend in the emergency department working as a scribe increases my desire to become a physician. In my study abroad program in Spain, I learned not only to listen but also to interpret the meaning behind words, which has helped me to better understand patients even in native English. I have seen all sorts of exciting traumas, illnesses, and procedures. However, the best part of the medical field is the underlying human compassion that drives us to clean up vomit, work night shifts, and expose ourselves to contagious disease. Steve Jobs' previous quote ends, And, like any great relationship it just gets better and better as the years roll on. Now that I am in medicine, I finally agree. Medical Spanish Interpreter - Emergency Room & Dental Clinic As a Spanish major who spent a semester in Spain, I was recruited from St. Norbert College to fill the need for local Spanish interpreters. I interpreted for Spanish-speaking patients in dental clinics and on-call emergency department hospital visits as well. I assisted with communications between the dentist/physician and the patient/family as well as with billing and insurance issues when necessary., Assistant Coach - St. Norbert College Men's Tennis As assistant coach I attended practices regularly to run drills with the help of the head coach. I also helped arrange the starting lineup, coached players during matches, and drove the team to away matches. In the off-season I helped scout and recruit players from high schools around Wisconsin. I met with them and their parents to advertise St. Norbert College's tennis program., Head Coach - High School Boys' JV Soccer As head coach of the Junior Varsity soccer team, I was responsible for holding tryouts, selecting the players, distributing uniforms, running drills and coordinating daily practices, and coaching games and tournaments. After the regular season ended I acted as an assistant coach to the Varsity as they qualified for the Wisconsin State Tournament., Tax Accounting Intern - Kimberly-Clark Corporation I assisted the Financial Reporting Department with the preparation and planning of Federal and State income tax returns of Kimberly-Clark Corporation and four of its subsidiary companies. This included inputting tax data directly into the returns for submission as well as preparing the supporting tax work papers. I prepared monthly sales and use tax returns for forty-six different states the company had sales in. I also assisted with income tax audits in the Legal Defense and Advocacy Department., Tax Accounting Intern - Menasha Corporation I assisted the tax and finance departments with various projects including financial reporting; tax return preparation for Federal, State, and International jurisdictions; sales and use tax return preparations; and supporting tax work papers for those jurisdictions previously listed., UW-GB Pre-med Club / Tri Beta Biology National Honor Society I attended weekly meetings, guest speaker presentations, and conventions for students interested in health care as a career. I volunteered to help with registration and advertisement for the annual blood drive organized by the club., High School Boys' Varsity Tennis - Head Coach I coached the West De Pere boys' tennis team and arranged the lineup for matches and tournaments. I was also responsible for organizing practices and running drills. In my first year as coach the team won its first conference title ever, and our top players finished third in the state. In summers following the regular season I held coaches' camps and found local tournaments for my players to continue competing in., Emergency Department Scribe I follow an emergency department physician on his/her shift. I review the patient's medical history and report anything significant to the patient's chief complaint. I chart the History of Present Illness, Physical Exam, procedures, and consultations in Medical Decision Making. I also enter the physician's orders for labs and radiology, obtain supplies as needed for exams and procedures, and basically act as an extra hand for the physician. Sometimes I interpret Spanish for physicians until the official interpreter arrives. The hospital went live with EPIC charting software recently, so it is also my job to know the software in and out and assist the department staff with any problems., St. Norbert College Varsity Men's Tennis I played four years of NCAA Division III Varsity Tennis and was Captain my senior year. I finished my career playing at the top lineup spots for singles and doubles. I earned three individual doubles titles, two individual singles titles, and two team titles in the Midwest Conference. We had two-hour practices on weekdays and regular weekend matches against colleges across the Midwest. The team also required eighty service hours as a valet for school music, theater, and alumni events. We also held an alumni tennis tournament to fund raise $12,000 to compete in the Palmetto Dunes College Tennis Invite in South Carolina during Spring Break each year., Physician Assistant Shadowing - Hospitalist I shadowed a physician assistant working under a hospitalist at Appleton Medical Center. Throughout the day I followed the physician assistant as she did her rounds, consulted physicians and anesthesiologists, and worked on charting. We also discussed her previous career experiences and the benefits of collaborative care, which had been recently implemented on the medical-surgical floors., Physician Shadowing - Endocrinologist I spent an afternoon shadowing an endocrinologist in his clinic. I saw a number of patients with diabetes and thyroid problems. Between patients, the physician and I discussed treatment options for these patients as well as some of the cases he saw as a primary care physician. We reviewed x-rays and toured the lab facilities., Tennis Teaching Pro I taught group and private lessons to players of all ages first at the Green Bay Country Club and later with the same staff at the Green Bay Tennis Center. I assisted in the Pro Shop with tennis merchandise, racquet stringing, and testing new products. I helped schedule lessons as well as coordinate tournaments and junior tennis events., Accountant - Regional Public Accounting CPA Firm (Full-time) I traveled to companies across the U.S. to perform financial audits involving an in-depth review of inventory management, financial reporting, and internal controls and security over financial reporting systems. The main concern was to find accounting errors, fraud, theft, or security weaknesses by employees of the companies. I worked to improve lean efficiency and process improvements for manufacturing companies. I also planned and prepared tax returns for businesses and individuals. I gave presentations for business improvement workshops and attended marketing events. I did the same work as a CPA and finished 2 out of 4 parts of the CPA certification before leaving the firm in 2012, Surgeon Shadowing / Student Volunteer - Inpatient Surgery I volunteered in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit restocking supplies in rooms, fetching blankets, and assembling charting packets for surgical patients. During and after my shifts I was able to talk to the physicians in the surgery department and request to sit in on any procedures in the department or in their clinics. I was able to sit in on a total knee replacement operation, three abdominal scopes, and an ACL repair. I was also to watch a tendon repair surgery in a hand surgery clinic., National Foreign Language Honor Society / Spanish Club I was inducted into the national honor society for foreign languages for my academic success as a Spanish major. I was elected Treasurer as a junior, and my senior year I was President of the St. Norbert College chapter. Responsibilities included organizing the annual induction ceremony and finding a relevant guest speaker for the society dinner, organizing weekly meetings, and working with the other foreign language clubs to hold events on campus. I organized Hispanic cultural awareness events with St. Norbert College Spanish Club such as dinners, speakers, and fiestas for Hispanic holidays. At UW-GB I attended discussion tables and events to help myself and others improve fluency."

    "text": "The January wind had all but frozen our lips. We were standing in a circle with a slight bow of our heads in downtown Cleveland to listen to the prayer of Charles, one of the people experiencing homelessness. I saw him regularly while volunteering on Monday nights with a group called Labre to distribute our prepared warm meals. I expected the fun banter we usually have with him, but that night, he gathered us around to speak of achieving our dreams and especially asked for our continued health. Regardless of every disappointing encounter in his life, he was thankful for his physical well-being. And only a moment before, I wanted to get back to my cozy apartment where I would be able to relax with a nice cup of hot tea and start on my lab report.  I was taking much for granted while Charles, with a coat that seemed flimsy at best and no place to call home, was still grateful that his body was in good condition in order to have the chance to find work. These two drastically contrasting characteristics were eye-opening. I realized that I was endowed with the utmost fortunate blessing of all: my excellent health. My heart went out to him along with the others who were not as lucky to be as healthy like Charles. Through this encounter during the two years of volunteering with Labre, I have come to want to give more than food and a chance to chat. I first went on the Monday night runs because of my desire to help those that are in dire circumstances. I came out of this experience with a promise to dedicate my life for fighting to keep those around me healthy. I want them to also live free of a debilitating illness and take hold of the opportunities that may turn their life around.  My decision to pursue a career as a doctor was never a result of a profound epiphany. I was first exposed to the field of medicine as a child. My grandfather was a physician and his clinic was situated in a small town called Cho-gae in South Korea. I was able to enjoy following him around and to soak up as much as a childs mind could. For my grandfather, being a doctor was not simply an 8 to 5 job. It was his life with both ups and downs. I realized the patience, strength, and endurance he had in order to see all his patients. He was always studying something even after his day at the clinic. After a childhood accident to my head while playing with the local kids, he was the one who took care of me. I will always admire him and strive to be the compassionate person he was. My desire to pursue this field was further cultivated through numerous undergraduate experiences, including those with Labre. My curiosity of the human body spurred me on to grab another opportunity and I dived into the world of research. As I was injecting a mouse with an anesthesia to prepare for a perfusion, I was in awe of the result of persevering to learn the various techniques of the lab. Performing them was exciting and brought about a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction. I felt I had just tasted the life of a surgeon and found myself wanting more as my childhood dream was slowly coming to a reality.  When I first started volunteering in the neuroscience laboratory, I had anticipated a textbook outline of what I was to accomplish. This however, was not given. My PI gave me the freedom to choose what I wanted to research. I was lost, but I began to venture out. Through this independence in the lab, I was able to hone my critical thinking skills. I investigated downstream effects of a new drug called amylin on the brain using Alzheimers disease mouse models. I was fascinated with the intricate mechanisms and with the unfathomable amount of pathways that seem to impact one another. I could see this aspect of exploration as a way to better understand a patients pathology in order to treat them in my future. Some may say that my accomplishment within the lab comes from winning an award for a poster presentation on my project or submitting a paper on the material. But I see these things as a bonus, a tip on top of the actual check. The hours I spent in the lab would not have been possible if I had lost sight on the overall purpose: the hope that this will be the first step toward more research on amylin, and that someday it may become clinically relevant and used in real patients. This knowledge was the true accomplishment.  I am aware of the life-long commitment I am making to my future patients and to the field of medicine, and I am prepared to take on this responsibility. I learned the true meaning of responsibility through my time as a supplemental instructor (SI) for organic chemistry. By undertaking the guidance of 200 students, I had become a better leader, speaker, and patient individual. Balancing my school work, volunteering, research, and my duties as a SI was, at times, overwhelming. Time management was key but more importantly, I loved what I was doing. Through my undergraduate experiences, I believe I will have the tools to overcome the obstacles I am bound to face during medical school in order to reach my dream. I challenge myself to become part of this exciting career albeit the difficulties and hope that this potential turns into reality in my future. Research Assistant/ Lab Technician After volunteering for a year to explore the various topics and techniques of the lab, I obtained the HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Institute) fellowship and funding in 2011 through SPUR (Summer Program for Undergraduate Research). I continued the research as my senior capstone project during the year of 2011-2012. And having participated in two undergraduate research semesters, I produced two papers and won 2nd place for the poster competition at the end of that year. Afterwards, I was offered a paid position with the lab through a co-op during the summer and fall of 2012 and submitted a paper as primary author to the Journal of Neurobiology which is currently under review., Civic Engagement Scholar (CES) Becoming a Civic Engagement Scholar required volunteering for at least 50 hours and participating in 3 of the plethora of community-focused programs present throughout the year. I chose to be involved with this organization because of the access to many different types of volunteering opportunities made available to the students. I learned about Labre through my involvement as a CES, and Labre became one of my most meaningful experiences throughout my undergraduate career. I was able to find other opportunities such as the Cleveland Foodbank where I assisted in sorting, preparing, and repackaging food to be distributed to the local hunger shelters., Executive Vice President and Treasurer From 01/09 to 08/09, a group of 8 students including myself came together to establish NSCS. I learned that through the initiative and hard work of our team, the kickoff of an organization was possible. During my sophomore year (09-10), we strove for our honor society to be a resource for freshmen and sophomores on campus to have access to networking, service, and scholarship through the national office. I organized and spoke during our first induction convocation for 200 members in 09/10. One of our most important service event was March to College Day in which I was able to set up and participate in guiding Cleveland high school students through our campus to encourage college education., Peer Tutor I assisted students through individual tutoring sessions by clarifying course content for general chemistry, organic chemistry, and Japanese. Each session lasted 30 mins or an hour. A few students became regulars and I appreciated being able to further explore the student's strengths and weaknesses. Being one of their peers, I learned the importance of the balance of being their friend and keeping the professionalism of a tutor. I thought this was the best way in guiding them through their homework and study materials since this facilitated an open and comfortable environment for students to voice their questions., SOURCE Natural Sciences Poster Competition Winner I presented my poster at the SOURCE Symposium which is held at the end of the year for any undergraduate who had previously applied with an abstract of their research. The poster session lasted three hours in which three judges came to hear a poster presentation of my work. I was evaluated by each for about 15 mins and was judged on clarity, thoroughness, and knowledge of my research. I was notified a couple of weeks later that I had won 2nd place in the Natural Sciences Poster Competition., Executive Member and Volunteer Coordinator I started off as the Volunteer Coordinator for GMI which involved arranging and participating in trips to MedWish International for sorting donated medical supplies to be shipped to developing nations. I was excited to see the possibility of redistributing items that would otherwise be in landfills. I was the driver to these events as well and went biweekly. As I became one of the 8 executive members, I raised awareness of necessary global healthcare through managing service events, such as benefit dinners, blood drives, and co-events with musical performance groups on campus. During the benefit dinners, I had the privilege to learn from doctors, nurse practitioners, and professors., Who's Who Recipient I was first notified for my eligibility in Who's Who Among American Universities and Colleges. I was able to submit an application which was reviewed by the Who's Who committee and received notification of my acceptance. It is an award that recognizes students based on academic merit, grade point average, service to the community, extracurricular activities, leadership experience, and more. Due to my GPA, volunteering through Labre, my involvement as a SI leader, and my academic endeavor through research, I was able to receive this certificate and celebrated with other Who's Who students at a luncheon., Recipient of Students Who Make a Difference I was honored to be a recipient of this award again for my senior year due to my involvement as a supplemental instructor for organic chemistry as well as my volunteer work through Center for Civic Engagement and Learning (CCEL)., Supplemental Instructor (SI) for Organic Chemistry My involvement as the supplemental instructor (SI) for organic chemistry has been the most leadership defined role of my undergraduate career. I was one of the two SI’s for this class of about 230 students. I prepared and led two 90-minute study sessions per week for students to reinforce material, and had in-class reviews as well as exam reviews outside of class. I attended the lectures myself and maintained communication with the professor Dr. Srinivasan on a weekly basis. Most importantly, I was happy to be available as a key resource for the students if they needed any assistance outside the class through prompt email replies and sessions., Labre Leader The Labre Program is an organization for students to deliver home-cooked meals and build relationships with individuals experiencing homelessness in the inner city of Cleveland every Monday night for about 4 hours. The people that we meet are bright and thankful, despite having to endure the bitter winter of Cleveland. I became one of the Labre Leaders and each of us rotated to either be the driver or the guide/scribe to ensure that every Monday night was secured and smoothly run. Weekly meetings were held to discuss the expansion of our organization, to manage fundraising events for raising awareness of Labre, and to gather the funds necessary for the food we provide to the homeless., Recipient of Students Who Make a Difference This award is in recognition for those who have been involved with spearheading a community service project, leading an initiative on campus, or serving as a member of a student organization. In recognition of their leadership roles on campus, students are honored and appreciated for their contributions. For my junior year I had the privilege to be a recipient for my volunteer work as a Civic Engagement Scholar, my leadership position in NSCS, and peer tutoring. I was invited to a luncheon held to celebrate with other student leaders as well., Primary Author This paper is submitted and under review. We administered chronic infusions of the amylin analogue pramlintide in the senescence accelerated prone (SAMP8) mouse, a mouse model of sporadic AD. The pramlintide administration was associated with improved performance in the novel object recognition task, increased protein expression of the synaptic marker synapsin I, and decreased expression of the oxidative stress marker heme oxygenase (HO-1). Moreover, it robustly increased cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) expression in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice. Citation: Hwang, H*, et al. Neuroprotective Effects of Amylin on Alzheimer’s Disease Pathogenesis and Cognition. Neurobiology of Aging. 2013., Tutor for Elementary School Students Through volunteering at Project Step-Up, I was able to tutor students in Grades K through 6 and mainly helped with arithmetic, reading, and writing. After the initial training session where I learned about the different learning styles and developmental stages of the youth, I was better equipped to handle the younger students who often wanted to play, more than study. The tutoring sessions were held at the Church of the Covenant on campus every Saturday morning for 3 hours. We would get a couple of breaks during each session where I was able to play with the kids eating donuts and finger painting., Family Business Young's Beauty Supply is my parents' business that was established back in March 2007. I have been working there throughout my undergraduate years for holiday weekends and vacations. I work as a cashier and help to accommodate customers for types of hair supplies and wigs. Due to my mother's wrist problems since this past spring, I have decided to be with them for this year before hopefully starting medical school next fall. The store is open from 9:30 am to 7:30 pm and I work for about 3 to 4 days a week which allows for my mother to rest and have a flexible schedule. Although the end date for this activity is listed as 07/13, this will be ongoing during the year of 2013-2014."

    "text": "I can't hear it, I said to my mom while standing with a Fischer-Price stethoscope pressed up to my grandma's chest.  \tHoney, I think you just rub it around and this little foam piece makes a sound like a heartbeat, my mom said, pointing to  a piece of black foam attached to the stethoscope's diaphragm.    \tOh, I said. My preschool self was slightly disappointed. The toy doctor's kit was neat, but I wanted to hear a real heartbeat.   \tIn the years that followed, I would use the plastic stethoscope, syringe, and blood pressure cuff to treat a menagerie of dolls and stuffed animals. But I still wanted the real thing. The curiosity that started that day in my grandma's living room continued to grow.  As a homeschooled elementary student, I came to love learning. In high school, I developed a passion for understanding how things work: a math equation, an organ system, or a religion. This is why in college I chose to major in Philosophy, which is, at its core, a study of reality.   \tThis love of learning draws me to medicine. I love that medicine will allow me to study the body and then immediately apply that knowledge to benefit my patients. This past May I shadowed Dr. Myers, an internal medicine specialist. Many of her patients have chronic conditions such as diabetes that affect multiple organ systems. Often her patients' initial symptoms would seem unrelated to each other. In her practice I saw how she used her knowledge of all the things I studied in biology, chemistry, and anatomy to unravel a patient's symptoms, find a diagnosis, and treat the condition effectively.    \tAs much as I love studying the body, this is not my strongest motivation behind becoming a physician. I want to be a doctor because I see a tremendous need for advocacy in healthcare. I saw firsthand the power of advocacy in the lives of two foster children that lived with my family for a period of time. In their short lives, these children had experienced horrendous violence, abuse, and neglect. It took the combined efforts of social workers, lawyers, and my parents to give these children a voice and to protect them from further harm. There are many people like these children in need of a voice. I have met them through reading their stories, volunteering in hospitals, and serving in the inner city. Often, the difference between a tragedy and a success story is an advocate - someone who knows the person, knows the situation, and knows the system. He or she is then able to find creative solutions, to speak up for those who are ignored, and to offer the hope of a way out.  \tThere are many careers that would allow me to be an advocate, but the role of a doctor is unique. A doctor is often the first to identify a need. People who would never go to a social worker, lawyer, or counselor will still go to a doctor. That doctor has the opportunity to connect them to other services. A doctor also impacts how a patient's healthcare affects other areas of their life, particularly their emotional health.  My grandma's last hospital stay was very difficult physically and emotionally. One afternoon, a young doctor took her outside in a wheelchair to enjoy the sunshine. This simple gift meant so much to my grandma. It made an otherwise difficult time a little bit easier. This kind of compassion and respect can have a huge impact.   \tThere is also a sense of advocacy that goes beyond individual patients to address the system as a whole. In reading about social issues and volunteering in the inner city of Chicago, I have discovered so much injustice. I do not have answers to these issues, but I know I want to find solutions. By combining the critical thinking skills of philosophy with a rich educational background and practical experience,  I will be in a unique position to bridge the worlds of doctors, scholars, community activists, and healthcare consumers to work towards common solutions.  \tIn short, medicine is a way to use my strengths to impact lives. By being knowledgeable and thorough I can give my patients an accurate diagnosis. By listening to their stories I can offer friendship, understanding, and compassion. By knowing the greater healthcare network I can connect them to health and social services to address quality-of-life issues that go beyond their immediate diagnosis. And by partnering with people in other fields I can help improve the overall system. This is why I am pursuing medicine. Cru Shepherd/Treasurer As a Shepherd (student leader),  I help plan weekly meetings and group activities for ~60 members. I have also organized campus-wide activities, such as First Week cookouts and an Easter egg hunt. As the group Treasurer, I manage the organization's financial accounts with the school. I co-lead a small group Bible study of ~12 women; this includes writing content, leading group discussion, and building relationships with women in the group. I coordinate the female leaders and help run a weekly meeting for all the student leaders. I am a formal mentor for three students. I have been the MC for our weekly meetings. I have led several trips to conferences., Miami Valley Hospital Volunteer As a volunteer on the Maternity 1, I assisted the staff with a variety of tasks. I filled patient water pitchers, stocked supply cabinets, made gauze packets, and helped with patient discharges. On the Family Beginnings unit, I assembled paperwork packets. Through this experience I worked closely with nurses and PCTs and observed the healthcare system from their perspective. I also saw babies and their families in all kinds of situations. I saw the effects that mothers' decisions had on their babies. I saw how language barriers can affect a patient's experience. Finally, I saw how one doctor, nurse, or PCT could alter a patient's entire entire experience by simply being observant., Shadowing (Dr. O'Connell and Dr. Laub) At Pain Alternatives, I shadowed Dr. Judith O'Connell and Dr. James Laub. Throughout my week observing them, I learned how solid scientific knowledge translates into quality patient care. Using a combination of thorough patient interviews and an extensive knowledge of anatomy, Dr. O'Connell and Dr. Laub could address patients' root problems, and start a treatment plan to correct them. I was fascinated by how the body systems were interconnected, and how a dysfunction in one part of the body could cause problems in multiple other parts. Both doctors had excellent relationships with their patients, both new and established. This made many appointments feel like conversations between friends., Discovery Program Assistant/Supply Coordinator From June to August 2011, I worked as a Program Assistant for the Discovery/Odyssey Day Camp program. My primary responsibility was to assist instructors in K-2 classrooms with classroom activities. Additional responsibilities included assisting with camper Drop-Off and Pick-Up, group activities, Afternoon Extended Care, and basic office work. I returned in June of 2012 as the program's Supply Coordinator. I continued to help supervise campers during group activities and Morning Extended Care. I was also responsible for purchasing, organizing, and distributing the weekly supplies for 10-13 teachers. I produced a detailed budget report and managed the camp supply room., Departmental Honors Project I am working on a departmental honors project on the ethical issues of telemedicine as a part of my pursuit of a University Honors Scholar designation. In the first half of the project, I researched the various ways telecommunication technologies are used to deliver healthcare services over a long distance. In doing so I identified three ethical issues of interest. In the second half of the project, I will address these issues in a paper using current bioethical theories. The result of my project will be a paper of about 20-25 pages and a formal presentation to a panel of department members. Through this project I am learning how to present my own thoughts to the academic community., Hobby: Knitting I originally learned to knit in elementary school with the help of a family friend. In high school I re-taught myself the basics and then continued to teach myself new skills. I love being able to create something with my hands and tackle the challenge of a new pattern. I also love being able to give things I have made to friends for special occasions., The Ronald F. Hough Endowed Scholarship I received a $1000 Hough Scholarship for the 2013-2014 school year. This is a merit-based scholarship designated for returning philosophy students., Shadowing (Dr. Myers) I shadowed Dr. Carla Myers of Internal Medicine Care, Inc. Through this experience, I had my first look at how a doctor's office operates from the doctor's perspective. I also saw what a difference a doctor can make in a patient's life by taking the time to ask the right questions and look at the whole patient. Dr. Myers was very thorough in her exams, following all the leads, even those seemingly unrelated to the patient's primary complaint or diagnosis. Through a combination of extensive medical knowledge and good detective work, Dr. Myers diagnosed conditions that others had missed. This showed me how I can put my love of learning to practical use for the benefit of my patients., WSU COLA Dean's list I was placed on the Dean's list several times while attending Wright State University. The following list indicates the quarters/semesters I was placed on the Dean's list, and the corresponding honors I received. Fall 2010(Q1): Highest Honors Winter 2011(Q2): Highest Honors Spring 2011(Q3): Highest Honors Fall 2011(Q1): Highest Honors Winter 2012(Q2): Highest Honors Spring 2012(Q3): Highest Honors Fall 2012 (S1): Highest Honors Spring 2013 (S2): High Honors, Cashier and Knitting Instructor I worked as a knitting instructor at Michael's from November 2011 through January 2013. My job responsibilities included creating samples and promotional materials, holding in-store demonstrations, and teaching classes of one to four students. I adapted the provided curriculum to my students' interests and abilities, and I also wrote several of my own lessons. In addition to teaching, I also worked as a cashier and  sales associate from November 2011 through April 2013. In both roles I learned how to interact with a wide range of customers, how to teach concepts efficiently, and how to collaborate with my coworkers. I was named Associate of the Month in August 2012.,  Sales Associate, Summer-in-the-City Participant Summer-in-the-City is an 8-week long volunteer program in Chicago. The goal of the program is to help meet the physical and spiritual needs of the city's disadvantaged. We partnered with local churches in a variety of outreach projects, including running a day camp for at-risk children, volunteering at a homeless shelter, and tutoring in a community center. The program also included training on issues of race, culture, immigration, and homelessness. In order to participate in the program, I raised $3,600 in financial support. During the trip, I was chosen to be co-captain of my ministry team and the student financial administrator.,  Supply Coordinator, Wright State University National Scholarship The WSU National scholarship is awarded to students who are National Merit Scholarship Program Finalists. It is renewable for 4 years and covers the value of in-state tuition, room/board, and books."

    "text": "Soccer tryouts in the summer of 2002 taught me that adversity may present unforeseen opportunities. I was a thirteen year old freshman competing against other players up to the age of eighteen. The fact that they were generally stronger, faster, and more experienced players than me did not undermine my tenacity and determination to make the varsity squad. My high school had an excellent soccer program that competed at the 5A level and attracted more players than many other schools. Fortunately, the challenge of two-a-day tryout sessions was made more bearable by having trained intensely for the state, regional, and national levels of club soccer. Intense competition and limited openings would be the key obstacles. I knew my versatility as a player would serve as my best chance to win a spot on the squad.  \tTo my dismay, halfway through tryouts my performance sharply declined. The harder I tried the worse the pain grew in my legs. I had successfully pushed through all of the fitness requirements, yet overall I was still lacking. I had pulled muscles in both quadriceps and my ability to run was significantly impaired. Several days later, the varsity squad was announced and my name was not called. Tears of frustration filled my eyes as I was called to go with junior varsity. Due to my quadriceps, the athletic trainer would not clear me to play for two weeks to facilitate healing. I was diligent in taking care of my legs. During my recovery, I developed an appreciation for sports medicine. I cultivated good friendships with the athletic trainers and even aided some of the other athletes with basic treatment. After fully recovering, I played one game with junior varsity before I was invited to join the varsity squad. My versatility allowed me to excel that season. \tResponding positively to physical adversity continued presenting opportunities throughout my high school career. In my junior year, a severe blow to my left knee shattered my medial meniscus and tore my anterior cruciate ligament. Treatment called for reconstructive surgery and a six-month rehabilitation. Finances only allowed me to go to physical therapy two times following the operation. After consulting with my surgeon, I started my self-made recovery program. Soon after the operation, I was in the school gym lifting weights to stay in shape. During my time in the gym, I had the opportunity to interact with Howard, one of our security guards. Howard and I connected well because he had also injured his knee significantly earlier in life. He was excited to see me recover and I was anticipating helping him to strengthen his knee. \tMy rehabilitation moved along faster than anticipated. Within a few months, I began biking. While still on crutches, I would go to the gym and bike nearly every day before lifting weights. During my recovery, I pursued coaching. I became an assistant coach for a little league recreational team in order to help prepare the players for competitive soccer. I guided my team of young athletes to a winning season before several of them moved onto competitive soccer. Within four months of the operation, I was back on both feet. I re-learned how to walk properly and began jogging. Soon thereafter, I was running and lifting weights with my legs. I encouraged Howard to join in leg workouts and exercises throughout the last couple months of my rehabilitation. After returning to soccer senior year, I would still stop by the gym to visit with him and see how he was progressing. \tIn college, my soccer career had not ended nor had my growth from the challenges soccer presented. After recovering from an ankle injury sustained in intramural soccer, I began training three times a day to tryout for the university's men's soccer team.  During one of my training sessions, my right arm went limp and my body grew numb from the waist down. I dismissed the occurrence thinking it was a pinched nerve and fatigue, but I was wrong. Similar incidences continued occurring along with unusual fatigue that would last for days. Such incidences raised additional challenges in the academic aspect of my life. Focusing during my classes grew more difficult. Aside from having to push myself to even attend my early morning classes, staying awake was another obstacle. I was unsure of what to think regarding the situation, so I sought medical support. A plethora of tests eventually led to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Initially, I was astonished, but soon thereafter I actively began making serious adjustments in my life. After working on my college campus for a few months, I saved up enough money to create my own business. Running my own business facilitated my ability to manage time more efficiently. My business required me to stay active which helped me deal with MS. While acclimating to the side effects of my treatment, I modified my learning habits in order to take in smaller portions of material per session and promote understanding. Exercise, diet, and rest became incorporated into routine planning with the intended purpose of maintaining an optimal level of performance. \tExperiences have often reminded me that life can be full of opportunity in the face of adversity. Progress is contingent upon how the individual applies the resources at hand. Coaching: Youth Soccer Coaching U10 boys soccer was a wonderful opportunity. My wife and I volunteered to assist a semi competitive team that was struggling with a lack of coaching. We were informed that in the Fall 2012 season the team had scored one goal and lost all of their games, but when we met the team there was definitely potential. We practiced on developing skills, passing, and shooting often to help the boys improve and gain confidence while having fun. Each practice was carefully planned to maximize involvement. After losing a series of games without scoring a goal the boys won their first game 4-3. The team ended this Spring season with nine goals. Their confidence and abilities continue to grow., Eagle Scout Project: Homeless Relief Effort Each year while visiting the homeless shelter with my family I always thought there was more I could do. These trips inspired my Eagle project idea. During the course of my Eagle project I had to coordinate efforts with the Denver Rescue Mission as well as several local grocery stores. I created routes through neighborhoods for volunteers to follow and supplied them with fliers, maps, and collecting materials (bags and boxes) for those who were ready to donate when they passed by. I also coordinated times for volunteers to inform customers entering grocery stores of the food and clothing drive. After collecting everything, I supervised transportation of the items to the homeless shelter., Graduate Research: Neutralizing Influenza Engaging research on a higher level of commitment is a challenging opportunity for growth. My master's research project involves inhibiting the influenza virus. Initially, the first four months of my research concentrated on learning how to test viral infection rates in MDCK cells and drug effectiveness against the virus. The primary viral target under examination is M2, the proton channel responsible for acidifying the viral envelope. Liposome assays and viral plaque assays were the primary methods I used to test the effectiveness of a drug against the virus. Currently, I am designing and synthesizing a new class of drugs to target M2. I also will begin resistance testing in the Fall., Shadowing/Clinical Translating Every week I volunteer as an interpreter for a family care clinic. I translate for Spanish speaking patients and his or her accompanying family member(s) as well as the primary care provider. It is wonderful interacting with patients and medical staff with a sense of contribution. I promote communication with a variety of patients and health complications that the primary care providers encounter. During appointments I assist in clarifying questions or concerns that the patient may have while accurately providing the corresponding responses from the medical professional. When the patient speaks English I observe how the medical team positively interacts with and cares for the patient., LDS Mission: Service Highlights I learned the importance of resourcefulness while doing service for others. Despite lacking good equipment such as a strong shovel or a full paint brush each service project was a success. I learned to attribute the success to team work, willing hands, loving hearts, and open minds.  My creative side flourished through service to others. In collaboration with three other missionaries I planned a way to use soccer to reach out to Spanish youth. The time we spent with these young adults helped them fight malicious habits such as smoking. I also helped teach English classes. From these experiences, I learned that expressing interest in what is important to others allows connections to be made., Entrepreneurship I used entrepreneurship to increase my business experience. After considering various business ideas, I concluded that window cleaning requires minimal overhead while yielding a fair return. Within a few months I was able to build my business up to cover a region over 50 miles long. I was responsible for every aspect of the business such as marketing, cleaning, building client relations, pricing, and accounting. Formation of my own business allowed me to make my own work schedule and improve my time management skills. I was able to meet and interact with various types of people through my business. I modified the business to include gutter cleaning in order to further build clientele., Specialist Shadowing II Observing the field of rheumatology further increased my understanding and appreciation of the practice of medicine. While with the rheumatologist I came to value dictation as an effective means of keeping accurate and updated records for each patient. I also learned that the implementing the principle of maintaining accurate records in all aspects pertaining to the medical institution affords increased efficiency. Through his example, the physician I observed showed me how to maintain an open mind to many possible solutions when treating patients and acting on the optimal one. He also taught me the value of doing the best work possible without criticizing another physicians work., Specialist Shadowing I The first specialist I observed was an opthamologist. Through his example the physician taught me how to be firm, yet understanding and encouraging when patients become discouraged. He also showed me the importance of communicating appropriate health information to both the patient and his or her accompanying family member or individual. Equally fulfilling was observing an orthopedic surgeon. I witnessed the importance of  collaborating among specialists as needed to ensure optimal treatment for a given patient. He also exemplified the value of promoting effective care by creating a positive atmosphere. After these experiences I anticipate learning and observing from the otolaryngologist., LDS Mission: Leadership Highlights Through my leadership experiences I learned the value of consistently being teachable. I grew in my ability to learn from other missionaries, church members, and leaders. While supervising four missionaries in Burgos for six months, I learned how to encourage the success of the missionaries under my supervision and the people they were helping. I learned true leadership is serving those you lead. I also supervised twenty-six missionaries in the Spanish Providence of Galicia for seven months. During this time I learned how to lead and communicate effectively. Every week I took the opportunity to reach out to the leaders in each city of the providence who reported to me., LDS Mission: Teaching and Training Highlights Through teaching and training I learned the importance of autonomy. I learned to be responsible for preparing to the best of my ability in order to help the one progress. I also learned that their progress is not solely contingent on the use of my agency, but the use of their agency as well. While training brand new missionaries in the mission field and teaching people I learned how to be patient and encouraging so that they could grow. It was during these months of training that I learned how to be a mentor for the first time. I recognized the significance my example had on my trainees as well as others around me. I strove to be uplifting during each contact I had with another person."

    "text": "I have spent my life contemplating the ways in which my passions can shape my own identity.  Digging through my family history, I have discovered my surnames ancient motto: magnanimus esto, which literally translates to be great of mind.  I live my life by this philosophy, motivating me to develop myself and to serve others.  I have used this phrase to explore the ways in which I can combine my interests, and my journey has led me to discover who I am, explicating my desire to practice medicine.  Growing up, I found solace in asking questions about the world around me, especially concerning the intriguing structure and mysterious function of the human body.  I developed a strong appreciation for explaining how things work in a particular way.  My passion for problem-solving, using the scientific method, persuaded me to major in engineering.  As a biomedical engineer, I applied my love for studying the human body to the next level, focusing on how the bodys functions can be measured, modeled, and manipulated to solve real clinical problems.  My research experience has shown me how engineering and biology can be utilized to improve our understanding of crippling diseases and novel therapies, serving as a conduit for translating my passion for understanding the natural world.  However, the lack of patient interaction I have had as a biomedical engineer left me yearning for more.  I want to make a stronger, more direct impact on improving the quality of life for those in need.  It was at Washington University that I first recognized the extent to which a physician can directly touch the lives of people.  On one particular occasion, after an eighteen-hour day in grand rounds, patient presentations, and surgery, my mentor, Dr. Pirooz Eghtesady, taught me how to read the Echo of a young girl suffering from Hypolastic Left Heart Syndrome, the disease that I was studying in his laboratory.  He listened to the young girl and her father, treating her symptoms as best as he could, and still mustering the energy to show me how he diagnosed her leaky mitral valve.  Although we were both a little tired, I could feel for the first time the thing that inspired him to continue.  I felt the healing power of a medical professional as he controlled the girls pain, giving him an opportunity to identify the root cause of her symptoms.  Once he realized what was causing her discomfort, I truly understood the purpose of his research; he was using it to extend his reach as a health care provider, to better serve children in need.  Through Dr. Eghtesadys example, I learned I could combine my passion for the science of studying the function and diseases of the human body with the art of healing patients.  I learned what it meant to be a physician, and I have wanted nothing less.  I decided to discover how I could use the practice of medicine to affect the lives of others.    I initially became involved with Crossroad Health Center to test my interest in medicine and find my own contribution to the cause of healing others.  Crossroad focuses on providing accessible and affordable health care to people of Over-the-Rhine, an underprivileged, urban community in Cincinnati, Ohio.  At Crossroad, most patients point to poor access to transportation, no health insurance, inadequate sources of income, or even disabling medical conditions, as barriers preventing them from making doctor visits or adhering to medical advice.  In fact, for many of them, their poor health prevents them from escaping the bonds of poverty, which in turn can block them from improving their health.  These patients have shown me the imperative need to eliminate these barriers.  Addressing social determinants of health along with the basic physiological manifestations of disease can enable individuals to improve their health and their access to health care.  By tackling these basic needs first, they can access more easily other resources that can contribute to their own success and self-development.  By listening to patients, taking care of them as human beings rather than their diseases, and educating them about all aspects of their health and their health care, I can empower them to take charge of their health and their lives.    I began my journey thinking magnanimus esto mostly applied to my personal growth and development, fueled by my passion for learning.  As I learned how I could help others do the same, my philosophy from this phrase has evolved, realizing that empowering individuals to take control of their health and their lives is what it truly means to be great of mind.  I have found myself in medicine and I know that my future lies not just in healing others but empowering them through health.  By becoming a health care provider, I will be capable of combining my passions for learning and serving others to break down barriers to accessing essential medical care, but also to build strong foundations upon which patients can build their lives, addressing social and environmental determinants of health.  Becoming a physician will provide me with the skills, experience, and opportunity to combine my pursuit of self-knowledge with my passion to be mindful of and an advocate for the health and well-being of others. Choose Ohio First, NSF STEM Talent Expansion Program Scholar As a recipient of the Choose Ohio First Scholarship within the UC College of Engineering and Applied Science, into which the NSF Talent Expansion Program is melded, I have actively engaged in educating and encouraging middle and primary school students in ways to solve problems by thinking, testing, and assessing like engineers.  I have done this through several programs that the University of Cincinnati community holds, such as the Society of Women Engineers' Middle School Outreach program, UC's Engineer for a Day program, and UC's Emerging Ethnic Engineers Summer Institute.  I am fortunate to have been a recipient of this award every year since 2011, including the 2013-2014 school year., Visiting Researcher and Physician Shadow As a research experience in co-operative education, I tested the role of inflammation in a rat model of Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS). I developed protocols and collaborated with experienced researchers and faculty to customize a methodology using computer software for analyzing morphometry of histological samples and to measure the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines present in diseased myocardium. I participated in designing a clinical study, including enrolling participants, collecting samples and surveys, and analyzing data.  In addition, I gained exposure to the clinical environment, from the perspective of a researcher, a cardiothoracic surgeon, and a pediatrician., International Student As a student in London, England, I explored a different culture from my upbringing. My classwork focused on the history of Britain, the communication of history through museums, the history of the Olympics and London’s impoverished East End. Exploring the socioeconomic impact of urban community gentrification and large-scale revitalization projects, like the Olympics, inspired me to examine urban disparities and health back home. I also immersed myself into the culture of the modern United Kingdom, especially delivery of and access to health care, public transportation, nutritious food, and physical activity, for improving public health and the public understanding of health and medicine., Co-auther of published manuscript As part of my research experience in biomedical engineering with Dr. Narmoneva, I was fortunate enough to experience the writing and submission of a manuscript for a summer conference. This experience in scientific publication made me appreciate some of the work that goes into publishing a project that is judged by my peers. I have since grown in my ability to communicate scientific research. My publication is cited as: Hurley JR, Sheikh A, Beckenhaupt M, Ingram C, Mutchler A, Narmoneva DA. Self-assembling peptide nanofibers for MMP delivery and cardiac regeneration in diabetes. Proceedings of the ASME Summer Bioengineering Conference, SBC2011-53761, 2011., Tutor, Teaching Assistant, and Peer Leader From my tutoring and instruction, I introduced first-year engineering students to the fundamental concepts of thinking like an engineer, with the aim of integrating concepts from multiple disciplines and applying these concepts to understand and solve technological challenges. From tutoring students individually and as a peer leader, I aided freshmen in identifying and understanding different engineering disciplines and possible career paths. I coached and evaluated students on how to design experiments and communicate experimental results effectively. I was able to better prepare undergraduate students in comprehending fundamental calculus and chemistry material., Volunteer Clinical Intern I am responsible for managing the quality of a peer-led, self-sustaining volunteer internship program at a level three patient-centered medical home focused on improving access and outcomes for an underprivileged, urban community in Cincinnati. I am in charge of tracking progress of specialist referrals for patients. I perform administrative functions necessary for successful operation of the clinic in addition to patient counseling on topics ranging from exercises for chronic knee and back pain to applying for Family Planning Medicaid. I am paired with a primary care provider to assist in monitoring patients and addressing their individual needs more fully., Student Leader, Organizer, and Mentor I have been Treasurer, Director of Communications, and President of the University of Cincinnati's Biomedical Engineering Society, continuing to serve the group and its members in every way I can.   During my leadership, we created a social network platform for the organization, hosted events for fellow students to participate in social engagement and community-building activities, fostered faculty-student communication, created a student-led curriculum committee for student representation in curriculum development, earned grant funding perennially from our Alumni Association, and coached peers in opportunities in research, industry, international co-op, study abroad, and career choices., Research Assistant in Biomedical Engineering I worked on a research team in the University of Cincinnati's Biomedical Engineering program to analyze the effectiveness of a drug delivery system for improving cardiac regeneration in a model of diabetic cardiac fibrosis.  As an introductory exposure to the biological laboratory environment, I collaborated with peers to discover more effective ways of collecting data and improving previous research methods.  Through organized workshops and presentations, I sharpened my skills in academic reading, technical writing, and presentation.  This experience paved the way for me to continue biomedical research at UC, Washington University, and Cincinnati Children's., Research Co-op in Molecular Cardiovascular Biology In my most independent research experience yet, as part of my co-operative education, I am responsible for creating a project to establish and verify an in vitro model of calcific aortic valve disease. I am examining mechanistic explanations for transdifferentiation of porcine aortic valvular interstitial cells leading to calcification, including an hypothesized role of biomechanical signal transduction in aortic valve calcification, and I am designing a set of experiments to test this. In addition, through this experience I have developed a personal approach to discussing, conducting, and presenting academic research. This is my final co-operative education experience for my degree program., Endorsed Candidate for the Barry M Goldwater Scholarship My nominations for the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship (in 2011 and 2012) have been powerful opportunities for me to reflect on my aspirations, my experiences, and my future directions. I have learned how my experiences have shaped who I am because of participating in this scholarship competition. In writing my scholarship application, I have discerned some of my deepest motivations for pursuing my career path. In getting to know the scholarship’s advisor, Pam Person, I have learned how to make life-changing decisions pertaining to my future career. Although I did not win an award, obtaining two endorsements from UC has made me a better individual, focused on shaping my career path., Participant and Student in Mini-Medical School Participating in the Mini-Medical School course at Washington University showed me what clinical care looks like from the perspective of a physician, a patient, and a medical student.  I gained an appreciation for advances in physical therapy, treatments for depression, and living life with chronic illnesses like cancer.  I learned how to take care of environmental emergencies such as snakebites, and I discovered the skills involved in performing microsurgery. As a result of this experience, I am now certified in adult and pediatric CPR/AED.  I learned how to measure vital signs, how to perform an abdominal examination, and how to visually inspect the eyes, ears, nose, and throat., Physician Shadow and Clinical/Medical Design Engineer This experience allowed me to build on my skills in the engineering classroom by solving a particular problem in the clinical environment. I worked on a team of doctors, biomedical engineers, and design students to address clinical needs of treating patients suffering from vaginal prolapse. We developed a conceptual prototype for surgical treatment of vaginal prolapse, keeping in mind the needs of the patient population and the constraints of the physician using our device., Regulatory Affairs Co-op Through my first experience in co-operative education, I was introduced to the medical device marketplace from the perspective of its regulation and compliance in the United States and across the globe.  I assisted the International Product Registration office with foreign government requests on product information and documentation.  I worked with colleagues and prepared documentation to re-certify higher-risk products in European markets."

    "text": "The physician asked me a simple question, one that many people hear multiple times a day. He simply asked me How are you Typically, the reply I would give would be along the lines of Just fine, with a smile on my face, but this particular question from this particular physician was different. Within the past three years my family had moved from Michigan to Indiana, my parents had divorced and both remarried, and I was about to enter high school. As the tears I was trying to retain started to stream down my face I admitted everything was not okay. The physician proceeded to talk me through why things werent okay, never once rushing me, never once checking his watch, just completely intent on being sure I was okay by the time I left his office.  He had been my doctor since I moved to Indiana and I had not felt more trust or stability with another doctor or adult at that time in my life. This was the first time I realized being a physician required much more than being knowledgeable of diseases and treatments. A physician must be compassionate, patient, and an excellent communicator, among various other characteristics. This was also the first time I was attracted to the thought of studying medicine.  \tAfter deciding to pursue medicine and completing my freshman year as a pre-medicine student, I began working in an assisted living home where I established a relationship with Dorothy that reaffirmed my interest in medicine. No, Im not going! Stop I cant go! I heard Dorothy exclaim my very first day, and every day after around 5:45 pm, when it was time to go to the dining room for dinner. Dorothy was a frail 90-year-old schizophrenic with osteoporosis. The easiest way to get Dorothy to the dining room was to tell her if she didnt go her son would be called. She would curse and bicker but typically would agree to receiving assistance. After a few weeks of working in the assisted living home, I didnt feel right threatening Dorothy to get her to eat. One late afternoon I walked into her small yellow room. She was sitting in her blue recliner with the white shawl she would wear every single day draped over the front of her, staring out the window.  I sat down on her floral bedspread at the end of her bed. I then asked her why she wouldnt go eat; what was it that she was so against She said it was the man I couldnt hear telling her she couldnt leave her room. Instead of threatening her, I grabbed her tiny hand and explained to her she had a disease with serious consequences if she didnt eat. After several minutes of discussion she believed in what I was saying and decided to go to supper. Every time after that when she would refuse to do something, I would explain reasons to her instead of ordering her. It didnt always work, and sometimes it took much longer than five minutes to convince her, but her retaining her self autonomy and me helping her make her own decisions instead of forcing her into them resulted in a much better outcome. As I walked through the dim hallways of the home that night checking that everyone was in bed, I heard a very light whisper from Dorothys room. When I walked in the room her frail bony hand reached for mine, a smile grew across her face, and she asked me to pray with her. I listened to her prayer and she very gently pulled me to her and hugged me goodnight. This became a ritual between us every night, and when I visit Dorothy today as I leave we pray and hug goodbye.  \t One summer later my encounter with a discouraged mother reconfirmed my desire to practice medicine. She had brought her 1-year-old daughter into the family clinic where I was volunteering and I was allowed to observe the appointment. After recording the height and weight of the infant the nurse practitioner showed the mother where the child was on the growth chart. The child was in the lower 30th percentile, lower than where she apparently was for her six month check-up. The tears started to roll as distress crept across the mothers face. The practitioner started to explain to her that many children have different growth rates and everything would be fine, but the mother cut her off. The mother continued to cry as she explained she felt it was her fault; she was going through very tough times and couldnt afford all the essentials for her family. I will never forget the compelling feeling to help her and others like her that came over me as she helplessly kept glancing at me. This clinic was located in a rural town that was underserved and the majority of patients did not have insurance or were under-insured. This particular incident not only reaffirmed my interest in medicine but convinced me that I am most interested in practicing medicine to serve the underserved.  \tSince sitting on the patient bed in my doctors office so many years ago, my expectations of the qualifications needed to become a physician have only evolved.  Observing various physician-patient relationships and establishing relationships of my own as a caregiver has strengthened my desire to cure patients based upon a relationship of trust that we have established. I strive to use the crucial assets of patience, knowledge, and compassion to better the lives of each of my patients someday. National Society of Collegiate Scholars Member After being inducted into the National Society of Collegiate Scholars in April of my freshman year I participated in various community service activities with the group. Several different volunteer services around Bloomington would contact the Indiana University director of NSCS and members would be asked to participate. Many volunteer activities were with the Boys and Girls Club of Bloomington. We also assisted with many canned food drives for a food pantry in Bloomington. We would volunteer at various benefit 5K walks and the annual Bloomington Book Drive. The NSCS was a great opportunity as I was able to partake in very different acts of community service and give back to Bloomington., Brigader As a Brigader in the IU Global Brigades for Public Health I participated in various activities around Bloomington, such as science demonstrations in elementary schools, and canning, a weekly fundraiser to raise money for the brigades. I participated in a week long brigade to Honduras where we visited two homes in the community of El Jute. In the homes we laid cement floors, built a stove, and constructed a hygiene station. We also went to the community school and discussed the importance of hygiene. Educating this underserved population and helping prevent disease were our main goals we accomplished. Many of us were able to connect with the families and create memorable relationships., Community Reception As a community reception volunteer at the Middleway Home for mothers and children of domestic abuse I am the first person to communicate with residents, volunteers, and the staff. I am responsible for relaying messages to the residents and staff, answering questions about the home, and welcoming donors. Maintaining the safety and confidentiality of the residents is my main concern. The potential threat of an abusive person entering the home makes some situations I deal with very serious. There are lighter situations as well where I am able to communicate and connect with many of the residents. This experience has taught me to be approachable, professional, and social in various encounters., Server As a server the customer's satisfaction and happiness are my main priority. Besides taking food orders and making sure everything ordered is correct, it is also my responsibility to be sure their experience at the restaurant is as enjoyable as possible. A lot of social interaction is required with the customers which has taught me to be personable and outgoing while giving them the best customer service possible. Being able to work with others and communicate effectively with my coworkers is essential to maintaining the positive environment of the restaurant. As a server I have learned to work professionally with my coworkers, and I have gained experience working as a member of a team., Undergraduate Teaching Assistant As a UTA I attended every class lecture, leaders meeting, and led a discussion of my own each week. I was responsible for understanding the material and doing my best to be sure my students understood the material and were prepared for class and exams. I would typically start my discussion with a review from material of the previous week's lectures and allow students to ask their questions. Then we would dive into a problem set and work through problems together. As a leader among my peers in this position I tried to establish respectful relationships while assuring they were learning. Some students came to me for guidance with other school issues and I enjoyed helping as much as possible., Bloomington ER Voluneer As a volunteer in the ER through the IU-ED program I shadowed various medical assistants, nurses, and physicians. I assisted the medical assistants with cleaning the rooms, taking vitals, and transferring patients to various parts of the hospital. I watched as MRIs and x-rays were taken and the radiologist would explain the results to me.  Whenever there was a code I was allowed to run along and watch the procedures and precautions taken. I was also allowed to observe many of the visits and observe a different type of patient-physician relationship. The urgency of decisions and the severity of potential consequences were unlike any other doctor appointments I observed before the ER., Pharmacy Assistant As a volunteer in the pharmacy of the Volunteers in Medicine office it is my duty to assure that the patients are receiving the correct medicine. The clinic provides medicine for uninsured patients through various pharmaceutical companies. It has been my responsibility to be sure I am educated about which companies provide medication at no cost to the patients. I have dealt with fragile situations with multiple struggling patients  due to unemployment and being uninsured who are worried about not receiving the medicine necessary if the companies cannot provide them. I am new to the clinic, but I anticipate I will learn more and be able to help the clinic with more volunteering this year., Aide in Assisted Living Home As an aide at the assisted living home my first priority was always the well-being of the residents. My main responsibilities were serving the residents their meals, cleaning the home, showering the residents, taking blood pressures and weights, and making sure that the residents were taking their medicine at the correct time of day. Whenever a resident didn't feel well or an accident happened it was my responsibility to fix the mishap to the best of my ability. Several residents suffered from diseases like dementia, so it was often necessary to repeat and explain things many times. As an aide I thoroughly enjoyed learning to tend to their physical, mental, and emotional health., Volunteer/Intern At the family clinic I was able to perform many different tasks including taking vitals, scheduling appointments for patients with specialists, and observing patient's appointments. I also assisted with various educational programs, mostly non-smoking programs. The administrator would often explain to me various challenges of the administrative aspect, mainly his issues with insurance companies and different pharmacies. I also assisted the nutritionist with her planning of meals and research for different patients. Volunteering in the clinic allowed me to gain hands on experience with dealing with complex situations and exposed me to many different aspects of healthcare., Science and Math Tutor I have tutored various students my freshman, sophomore, and junior year of college and anticipate continuing my senior year. I typically help with math; any general, organic, or inorganic chemistry; and general or molecular biology. I also help with various intro-level English papers. Some of the students I tutor are international students, which often require more patience and understanding due to the language barrier. It is an interesting experience as bits and pieces of different cultures are exchanged. Having a variety of different students in different levels and types of courses has helped me understand and visualize different learning capacities and personalities of many people., Research Assistant I help with research in a lab of the kinesiology department at IU. The purposes of the studies I assist with are to study the effects of exercise or lack of exercise and diet on the inner wall of the blood vessels. My main tasks in the lab are drawing blood, which I did after being certified and trained, to pipet the centrifuged blood, and to help with whatever other tasks the leaders of research need to be fulfilled. I am also gaining experience with the EKG machine. In the lab I am able to use and better understand concepts of human physiology I have learned in biology and chemistry. The extreme attention to detail and analysis requires me to expand my critical reasoning abilities.,  Nurse's Aide, Shadowing Various Physicians Over the past three years I have shadowed different physicians: one family practice, one pediatrician, and one obstetrician/gynecologist. While shadowing, I would observe the initial interactions between the patients and physicians and listen to the questions from the physician or the problems of the patient. Next I would listen as the physician explained the diagnosis or medication being prescribed. After almost every appointment I would ask the physicians why or how they knew what was wrong. Shadowing several physicians allowed me to observe different decision processes. I was also able to observe how each physician dealt with different patients and handled various relationships.,  Server, First Aide Volunteer The IC-EMS is composed of IU students who volunteer as either EMTs or First Aide. I was certified as a First Aide/CPR volunteer. The IC-EMS typically volunteers at various activities on campus and in Bloomington, such as various 5K runs, Little 500 practices and races, and other activities where there is a large group of people who could potentially be hurt. As a First Aide volunteer I clean many scrapes and cuts, bandage small injuries, and assist the EMTs whenever they need help. This particular experience has exposed me to very different types of patients with varying tolerances and perceptions of pain. It has also allowed me to participate and observe rapid decision making., Youth Volunteer at The Rise The Rise is a home where domestically abused women and their children can live as the mothers attempt to establish a new and better life. The children would spend their evenings after school in the youth program until their mothers returned to the home after work. After school the volunteers would tutor the children as they did their homework or played educational games until supper. After dinner we would play with the children until their mothers arrived. These children were of a different background than others I had previously been associated with. The situations I learned to help with were much more delicate than other interactions I experienced with other young children before., Cheerleading Coach Two times a week for the fall football season I coached fifteen cheerleaders with another woman. The team cheered for a youth football team and the girls were from ages five to ten, split into two age groups. The other coach and I would meet and create routines and cheers and then teach them to the girls. The girls would perform for their parents and at Saturday games. I had babysat children quite often before this, but never had I really interacted with children I didn't know very well. I was unsure of how I would interact with them in a more foreign situation, but this experience made me feel much more comfortable and allowed me to connect with the children in a more professional setting."

    "text": "The foundations of my passion for medicine were ultimately solidified in Delhi, India. I worked for six months in a small hospital and community outreach center for people living with HIV, where three Indian women, Saira, Savita, and Rajni, practice medicine.  These women taught me how to walk alongside people in pain. Their labor among marginalized communities demonstrated so clearly the value of entering into the struggles of the poor and listening to their stories. As I observed their interactions, my own paternalistic aspirations to rescue the medically underserved steadily began to fade, and I saw medicine practiced in a way that was inclusive and dignifying. This involved joining people in the concrete, painful realities of living and dying; it meant feeling for ourselves the uncertainty and fear that surrounds living with HIV. We wept with those who wept. Too often these physicians could do little more than be present with those who were suffering, but they were courageously willing to do so. In their work I saw healing as a journey with others, not a service to others. This deep devotion captivated me and ignited within me a passion for practicing primary care in underserved and under-resourced communities.  During this time in Delhi, I also learned to locate myself within a community. This involved both recognizing social contexts and also valuing relationships with the hospital staff. I noticed that a physician's work involves understanding the social location in which each person lives. The doctors at this Delhi hospital taught me to explore the economic and political context surrounding each patient, and they helped me see the connections between that context and their patients' health. In the classroom, I had studied the relationship between social inequalities and health, yet I did not fully grasp this reality until I experienced it first-hand. Urbanization was fueling the proliferation of unhealthy living conditions in the slums. Gender inequality placed married women at high risk for contracting HIV. The complex issues surrounding HIV were no longer abstract; rather, I saw them in real people. Because of these experiences, I hope to learn more about how medicine can be practiced in a way that is alive to the social context of a community.  Locating myself within a community also meant relying on the hospital staff members for support. Initially I did not see the deep significance of this internal community, but I soon learned that it was essential for continuing our work. Not only did our closeness improve our effectiveness in serving local people, but in the face of near constant suffering in the ward, the staff members became a tight-knit support system. They helped me to see in a way that I could not see on my own. I learned what it meant to see desperation in a mother's eyes and at the same time see the inexplicable joy in the eyes of her young child. I saw death and I saw life restored. In all of this, these friends helped me to sustain a radical hope. Theirs is a hope that grows in the midst of life's deepest challenges, a hope that is rooted in the life and faith of a community with an unshakeable vision of healing. In light of these realizations, I am determined to always work as part of a team committed to striving together for healing.  My time in Delhi also dramatically shaped the way I think about healing. When I first arrived in Delhi, I thought that healing meant physically curing a disease. But a hospital for people living with HIV struggles against a disease that cannot be cured. What does healing mean in a context where there seems to be no healing How can a physician's work be meaningful in a context where she cannot cure The women at this Delhi hospital taught me to see alternative conceptions of healing, possibilities that were even deeper and more life affirming than physical cures. I learned that healing is multidimensional, integrated, and grounded in everyday experience. For Anjani, it meant working outside her home for the first time, thus enabling her to access medicines that she needed. For Meghna, one of our transgender patients, it meant a few minutes of meditative prayer. Healing could involve reconciled relationships, economic security, political dignity, spiritual peace, or in some cases just one day free of pain. Most of all, I realized that it was always a process, always a journey. I want to learn more about the intersections between these fundamental areas of life and a physician's work, and I want to participate in this journey of healing with others.  Living in urban-poor areas of Delhi and working in this modest hospital served to shape my perspectives and led me to commit to a vocation in medicine. Three specific themes are woven throughout my reflections, and they sustain my passion for further inquiry: walking alongside people in pain by being present with them in suffering, living within a community that is aware of its social context and that offers hope through its intentional support, and participating in a journey of healing that touches the multidimensional realities of everyday life. High School Youth Leader At my local church I was a youth leader for a group of 5 young men who were in high school. The group was racially and socioeconomically diverse, including two refugees from Thailand and Sierra Leone. Each week we discussed the challenges and successes they experienced, and I counseled and encouraged them when they were facing difficulties. Our conversations often focused on violence, religion, and race, as these issues were consistently raised in their high schools and homes. In addition to our regular meetings, I was available for these young men throughout the week by attending their sporting events, sharing meals, and spending time with their families., Teaching Assistant for Invertebrate Zoology Lab Because of the incredible diversity among terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, the lab component of the Invertebrate Zoology course is challenging and detailed. For this lab, I organized and catalogued over 200 preserved specimens, demonstrated dissections and built anatomical displays, explained procedures clearly to 15 students, and relieved any confusion by patiently answering the students' questions. Later in the semester, I also maintained and cleaned 45 stock tanks of Cordylophora spp. (an invasive marine and freshwater invertebrate) for Dr. Nadine Rorem's ongoing research.,  Care Coordination, Emergency Department Volunteer During 4 hour shifts in the Emergency Department, I assisted nurses and technicians with transporting patients and cleaning 32 hospital beds, and I regularly conversed with patients to ease apprehension and support understanding. At various times, I also shadowed an emergency medicine physician (Dr. Timothy Love, 8 hours total) and a general surgeon during three surgeries (Dr. Jeff Russel, 4 hours total)., Wheaton College Scholastic Honor Society Each year the faculty of Wheaton College selects a limited number of students from the senior class (less than 7%) to be inducted into the Scholastic Honor Society. Selections are based on high scholarship, personal character, commitment to service, and contribution to one's major department. I consider membership in this society a high honor because it demonstrates my professors' confidence in my academic abilities, as well as their recognition of my passion for service. The society remains connected after graduation and provides financial support for the further education of its members., Mission on Our Doorstep Conference Each year World Relief sponsors a conference in which local leaders of racial and ethnic minority communities come together to share about various successes and struggles within their communities. The conference in 2012 specifically addressed human trafficking, immigration, and generational issues in immigrant churches. Attending this conference exposed me to marginalized communities that were living in the suburbs very close to Wheaton College; I listened to their stories for the first time. This experience began to equip me to see poverty and exclusion even in affluent areas, and it has contributed to my current passion for living among marginalized communities in Chicago., Tutor in English as a Second Language I became good friends with two refugees from Myanmar, Sui and his wife Vaan, as I tutored them in English each week. I supported their progress from a basic level to an intermediate level of speaking over the course of 9 months. In addition to ESL tutoring, I introduced their family to using the library, assisted them in paying bills, mediated conversations with their landlord, and addressed their additional needs whenever possible. In one instance, the family's infant daughter, Sophia, developed a painful rash on her face. I drove them one hour away to a dermatologist who accepted Medicaid, and ensured the family understood the instructions they were given., Care Coordinator I currently work 40 hrs per week in a primary care clinic as part of a Family Practice care team. I regularly assist patients in navigating the healthcare system by scheduling consults and tests for them. I also research healthcare options to ensure that patients receive the best possible care, advocate for patients to be seen by specialists, and track referrals to confirm that patients keep appointments. In addition, I utilize databases to track patients who are discharged from the hospital in order to schedule follow-up appointments with their primary care providers, and I participate in population health management by reaching out to high-risk populations in relation to diabetes., Panel Discussion on HIV/AIDS I organized and presented on a panel discussion about HIV/AIDS with three fellow students and two Wheaton College faculty members. Our objective was to spark discussion among the student body about the complex social issues associated with HIV. My presentation focused on HIV among married women and migrant workers in Delhi, India. I shared specific stories to illustrate the discriminate nature of HIV--how the disease typically thrives in populations that are already socially, economically, and politically disadvantaged. The event was sponsored by the Human Needs and Global Resources Office and the Psychology Department. Over 40 students and faculty members attended., Child Family Health International Intern I participated in the Introduction to Traditional Medicine program, which focused on traditional and indigenous systems of medicine in India. I learned about Ayurveda, Naturopathy, Reiki, and Homeopathy by shadowing practitioners of these systems and attending lectures given by local teachers of traditional medicine. I also shadowed local practitioners of allopathic medicine and observed how their understanding of indigenous practices and cultural assumptions allowed them to practice medicine more effectively. This experience was foundational for my competence in living and working in cross-cultural settings., Club Water Polo I was a member of the first Men's Water Polo team of Wheaton College. Several members of the varsity swim team and I established Men's Water Polo as a club sport, and after several months of practice, we helped to create a student-organized tournament with Carthage College. During this year of playing water polo, I learned the enjoyment of creating a new organization, the value of rigorous exercise, and the importance of meaningful friendships within a team., Academic Recognition Since my first science courses in high school, I have been passionate about learning and have committed to academic excellence and creativity. As I encountered more advanced material, my passions grew; I welcomed the challenge of difficult subjects. My academic competence is evidenced by merit-based scholarships and awards that span my undergraduate career. These include the National Merit Scholarship (Finalist status required), President's Award (3.6 high school GPA, ACT score 32, and sustained GPA over 3.0 required), Sophomore Class Scholarship (for superior academic achievement in sophomore class), Dean's List 3 semesters (3.5 GPA required), and Honors List 4 semesters (4.0 GPA required).,  Teaching Assistant, Big Sibs Program The Big Sibs Program is an integral part of freshman orientation week at Wheaton College. Throughout the week, I befriended a group of 10 incoming freshmen to ease their anxiety and facilitate their transition into life as an undergraduate. I also taught my group members how to use the public transit system by leading them on a day's trip around Chicago. I continued to meet with these students during their freshman year to provide ongoing support and to listen to their experiences., Human Needs and Global Resources (HNGR) Certificate The HNGR program studies the challenges facing nations and people of the Global South through classroom study, a 6 month service-learning internship in development, and academic research. The program includes 16 hours of preparatory coursework in anthropology and development, and 12 hours of coursework while in the field. During my internship I lived in Delhi, India with a local host family and worked at Shalom Delhi--a small hospital and community outreach center for people living with HIV. In addition to shadowing physicians at the hospital, I joined Shalom's Home-based Care team, which regularly visits over 80 families affected by HIV to provide health education and emotional support., Summer Camp Counselor The objective of Precept's summer camp is to train and equip high school students to become leaders in their local churches and schools. I led a group of 15 students each year, challenging them to think creatively about leadership and counseling them as they shared personal stories and struggles. I encouraged these students to imagine practical ways in which they could positively impact their communities, and I followed up with them during the year through personal communication., Guitar While I have played the guitar since I was 12 years old, this endeavor became more meaningful than I ever anticipated during my time in Delhi. In the small hospital in which I worked, the staff sang Hindi songs each morning for the patients. I was asked to play the guitar for these songs when the regular guitarist went on leave. As a result, I began to learn many songs in Hindi. This became an enjoyable source of language acquisition, but more importantly, it was a meaningful point of connection to the staff and the patients. On World AIDS Day 2012, we hosted a gathering of 80 families affected by HIV. I composed a song in Hindi for the event, and we sang it as a staff for the families."

    "text": "Honest confession: I havent always been sure I wanted to study medicine. Sure, I want to help people and all, but who doesnt Im not one of those individuals who has had a dramatic and life-altering experience in which their path in life becomes crystal clear. Its been a quiet calling, the kind that grows on you gradually, and which provides innumerable small reminders that you are indeed on the right path even when you start to feel daunted by the task ahead of you and begin to doubt your own resolve.   In light of this, who am I to be applying to medical school I am the kid who played with my food, examining all the blood vessels and muscle attachments on my meat with all the wonder and curiosity characteristic of a child. I am the grade schooler who spent hours engrossed in reading her textbooks for fun. I am the high school anatomy student who loved to dissect the remainder of the family rotisserie chicken during dinner, excitedly identifying all the analogous structures and marveling at the complex way they all worked together. I am the college student who stood in awe of the genius of telomeres in genetic replication and who gets so excited for class registration day that she can hardly contain herself.   I developed an interest in the interaction between the body and the mind in high school, when my younger brother developed some interconnected health and behavioral difficulties. His problem was complex, and I watched Mom take him to specialist after specialist, looking for a diagnosis--the first step to healing. I saw the need for disciplinary integration to provide care for the patient as a whole, and the need for true compassion in physicians. I wish to be that kind of physician, one who responds with compassion and knowledge, one who is willing to take the time to sit with each patient and unravel the complexity of the health issues in partnership with the patient. I saw this clearly shadowing my physician, James Kolp, D.O. He took the time to ask about patients' lives outside the office, alert for other things going on in their lives that would need additional resources or referrals and any complications that might affect the course of treatment. I watched him hand out handfuls of free medication samples to patients on fixed incomes worried about whether to buy their food or medications that month. That is compassion worthy of emulation.   When I first applied to my internship at Crossroad Health Center, there was a question on the written interview that stumped me for a moment: What do you consider your greatest accomplishment My trouble wasnt a perceived lack of accomplishments. Everything popped into my head simultaneously: performing on the international stage with my barbershop quartet; my research experience at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital; designing a novel solar cooker affordable enough for the low income populations of Ethiopia for my Social Entrepreneurship class; or any of the other glorious moments. Then it occurred to me that my greatest accomplishment has nothing to do with glorious moments and everything to do with grit. My greatest accomplishment is the dedication of getting out of bed each morning, whether smiling or grumpy, and packing my bags for class. My greatest accomplishment is the hours I sat at my desk, voluntarily giving up sleep and socialization in order to complete my homework well. The grit and loyalty I learned through this is what enables me to be successful at crucial tasks, whether it is planning events for students to engage their faith at the Newman Center, leading mentoring meetings at Hughes High School, sticking with my friends when forgiveness is overdue, or being the shoulder to cry on when I cannot fix what is wrong.   Yes, I have moments when the path ahead can seem overwhelming. It will demand a lot of me and theres no sense in denying that. But I have a passion and dedication that does not let me yield or give in. In a way, Im glad that I didnt have that flash of inspiration and clarity that others experience. Being a doctor is an everyday task. It is not just composed of glorious moments, though those are a part of it too. But my experience of uncertainty and my quiet calling were able to teach me in a unique way that moments of doubt dont have to be the last word. Instead of letting them paralyze you, you can choose daily to go forward through uncertainty. Cincinnati Sound Chorus CSC is a 4-part acapella chorus that sings in the barbershop style. CSC performs at  venues in Cincinnati, competes annually in regional competitions, and participated in the World Choir Games. I have attended this chorus during the summers since the age of 9, but finally made a firm commitment to it in my freshman year of college. Although a member for less than 3 years, I was appointed as a member of the music team and I have been one of the section leaders for more than a year. It is my job to lead sectionals and I am held responsible for my fellow section members. Due to my talent in learning music quickly and accurately, I am often called upon to record learning tracks for new music., Future Science Girls Mentoring Program Future Science Girls (FSG) is a mentoring organization at the University of Cincinnati to encourage high school girls to pursue college educations, especially in the sciences. It began as an offshoot of the pre-medical society, but grew into its own organization through the efforts of a dedicated team of students, of which I was a part. I have served as a Project Coordinator since its inception, and currently also serve as Vice President. I plan mentor meetings for the girls and facilitate those meetings at the high school. The experience of starting an organization and the struggle to find our niche and keep the meetings engaging and relevant has been challenging, but rewarding., Barbershop Quartet I have been a part of a vocal quartet with my sisters for several years. I began my first quartet at the age of nine and competed for three years. I picked it up again in college when my younger sister expressed an interest in singing with us. We competed in this arrangement for several years, earning our spot on the international stage in the young women's bracket. We have since aged out of that into the adult women's bracket, and are heading for regional competition this year. The experience has been valuable to me, teaching the importance of dedication, discipline, and the skill of giving and receiving constructive criticism from coaches and hardest of all, from other members of the team., Piano Instruction I have been taking piano lessons from a young age. From that time until the end of high school, I took weekly lessons from the Music Station in piano technique and theory. In college, I took several quarters of private lessons through the University's College Conservatory of Music. Even though my formal period of instruction has ended, I continue to challenge myself through application of the lessons from my formal instruction to the learning of new pieces, both for my own enjoyment and for paid accompanying work. In addition, I have taught piano to younger students. In junior high and high school, I had several private students, and I continue to help my old teacher out as a substitute., CCHMC Teaching Services Volunteering I volunteered for three hours a week during the summer at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center to gain clinical experience and work directly with patients. I worked in an educational role, teaching long-term pediatric patients (K-12) in the Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant wings. Each patient had his or her own individualized educational plan and needs, so I had to be flexible in my instruction methodology, as well as with my lesson times to accommodate the needs of the other members of the medical team and the patient's family. I was able to work directly with patients and develop working relationships with several of them as well., Cantoring The cantor is the vocal musician who leads the congregation in singing at Mass. When my music director was recruiting young cantors in the 7th grade, I willingly volunteered, given my musical background and inclinations. Standing up and singing in front of everyone I knew was a bit nerve-wracking the first few times, but I gradually gained more confidence as the years went on. Now, when I walk into the church, my music director seeks me out to help out on weeks when I'm not scheduled to sing. She knows that I can sight read vocal music well and love to harmonize with the hymns., Choose Ohio First (COF) Health Professions Scholar The Choose Ohio First Health Professions Scholarship Program is a program designed for Ohio residents in the STEMM disciplines. It aims to assist learning through the use of innovative program workshops and individual advising. The specific scholarship I received is $4,500 annually for four years and is designed to enhance the success of future health professionals by promoting an understanding and appreciation of cross-disciplinary work. The workshops most memorable to me were the book discussions on First, Do No Harm (Lisa Belkin) and The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (Rebecca Skloot), as well as a multi-disciplinary health profession speaker panel on collaborative patient treatment., Cincinnatus Excellence Scholarship The Cincinnatus Excellence Scholarship, formerly the Cincinnatus Scholarship and the UC/21 Scholarship, is a full tuition scholarship of about $17,000 annually ($68,000 for four years). It includes all in-state tuition and on-campus room funding; a one-time award of $1,500 for computer purchase, study abroad experience, or undergraduate research; and admission to the University Honors Program for experiential learning opportunities. This award is offered to a maximum of 60 National Merit Finalists coming to UC each year and requires 30 hours of community service annually and a minimum 3.2 GPA., National Merit Scholarship The National Merit Scholarship is a prestigious scholarship awarded to only 8,300 National Merit Finalists nationwide each year. Mine is sponsored by the University of Cincinnati and is $2,500 per year for four years., St. Monica St. George Newman Club The Newman Center at St. Monica St. George parish serves as a community for Catholic students on campus. I became involved starting in my freshman year and have continued my involvement since. I have taken on more and more leadership roles as I have been involved and now I am a leader for Emmaus, the student-led faith sharing group, and a Student Coordinator for the Christian Living team. I have been involved in things as varied as planning educational events for students, facilitating small groups for meetings, cooking for our weekly community dinner, and leading service trips to rural Appalachia., Crossroad Volunteer Internship Program The Volunteer Internship Program at Crossroads is a new program aimed to give pre-medical students clinical experience while helping to make the clinic run more smoothly. We are a highly self-run group within the clinic with our own organizational and executive positions, even keeping a blog about our work. Through it, I have had the opportunity to perform various tasks, including shadowing providers, tracking patient referrals, and standardizing exam rooms. My tasks continue to grow. This upcoming year, I will be filling the position of Care Coordinator, working with physicians to make sure all their needs are met and that our care coordination is of the top quality., WISE Program Undergraduate Research The Women in Science and Engineering program provides research experiences to female undergraduates. I worked full-time in the Pediatric Orthopedics Lab under the mentorship of Donita Bylski-Austrow PhD. I worked with one of the masters students in the lab on a project to test the effects of a new surgical staple design on certain spinal movements. Although I did not have any background in engineering when I entered the program, I bridged my knowledge deficits and was able to work effectively across disciplines on the project. I learned a lot from the weekly program workshops and from my experience in giving professional presentations, but most important was the confidence I gained."

    "text": "I am ten years old and helpless as my mother begins a stage of going in and out of illness. She often expresses fearfully, If something happens to me, take care of your sisters. By the time she is past this, I am an adolescent. Towards the end of high school, my mother receives three surgeries over a year and a half. I find myself hoping to do for others what doctors had done for my mother.  Growing up in a home where my mother was often ill, the responsibility of taking care of my sisters became mine. While this could have been a hindrance, it actually helped me develop the attribute most integral to being a physician-empathy. It also constructed my desire to advocate for people both inside and outside my home. In high school, I pushed for the foundation of a Gay Straight Alliance. It was the first time my empathy translated into action, but this pattern has guided me throughout college as well. \tDuring my second year at Berkeley, I heard about Global Brigades; a group that sends volunteers to Honduras for medical relief and public health projects. I traveled to Honduras in January without grandiose expectations. We set up makeshift clinics in poorly lit classrooms every morning for a week. Six hundred patients passed through in four days but I remember a few very vividly. An elderly woman, diagnosed with breast cancer, had undergone a mastectomy but received no follow up care. When she heard her cancer had not returned, the joy on her face was indescribable. Sadly, not everyone we saw had such positive experiences. A fourteen year old boy had been in a car accident four years earlier and could not afford treatment. His knees were the size of melons and out of place on his lanky body. When he arrived we referred him to a public hospital, knowing he would not receive care in the future. While I was intellectually aware of the disparities in health care, this was one instance that helped me understand these differences emotionally as well. The frustration I felt helped me connect what I saw in Honduras to the times I have watched doctors turn away patients here in the U.S. This encouraged me to educate others about global health issues. Before students go on the brigade, they are required to take a class discussing political situations in Latin America and health care in Honduras. I will be co-teaching this class next semester and hope to promote the discussion that physicians have a responsibility to propose viable solutions to help solve current health care problems.  \tAlong with Global Brigades, my many experiences teaching while at Cal have furthered my desire to pursue medicine. In Peer Health Exchange, I work with high school freshmen; a group that is not always courteous. Most of the time students are rowdy and hard to calm down. At first, teaching required me not to just know the material, but to build patience. Soon I understood what it took to work with this age group and how to impart relevant information to them.  After working with PHE, I realized that I appreciated teaching and decided to be an undergraduate student instructor at Berkeley for a biology course I had taken previously. I spent a semester holding weekly reviews, providing resources when someone needed extra help. These experiences taught me that even when working in similar settings, your approach depends entirely on the people you are working with. Being a health educator and an undergraduate student instructor also left me with a sense of how important it is for an individual to pass on what they have learned to others and encourage application of that knowledge. Alongside these activities, my education itself has prepared me for medical school. I began college as a pre-med, majoring in Chemical Biology. I soon learned about Integrative Biology which is a very broad major, bringing in anthropology and psychology. This led me to an interest in anthropology which I will minor in. Anthropology has been one of the most enlightening aspects of my education, teaching me to approach situations critically while also considering all of the possible solutions to a problem. It has offered me the understanding to approach medicine and the individual with more than just science. I now realize a competent doctor must consider the behavioral and cultural factors that affect a persons health as well. My time at Berkeley has provided me with far more than the minimum science background. Cal has taught me to approach situations more analytically and this is something I will to carry into my medical education and beyond. \tWhen I was younger, becoming a doctor was a vague ambition driven by a desire to help people. Today, my drive to pursue medicine has been revitalized by the many small lessons I have learned through these experiences and it has been strengthened by the transition in perspective these experiences provided. I once believed medicine to be a career that consisted only of healing but I now understand that being a physician consists of a lifestyle of healing, as well as education and advocacy. Whether it is promoting preventative care by educating patients or working with them so they can receive the care that is right for them, I will use both empathy and holistic analysis in playing an exceptional role as a physician. Global Brigades Board Member As a board member, I am involved in publicity, fundraising and recruiting new members for Global Brigades. Along with other board members, I interview students for upcoming brigades and work to ensure that the brigade has the funds it needs. During the upcoming school year, I will also co-facilitate the class that students must take before they go on the brigade to Honduras., Global Brigades Volunteer As a volunteer in Global Brigades, I was required to take a semester long class that discussed the political and economic conditions in Honduras. I helped organize fundraising events for my brigade. In January 2013, I went to Honduras for two weeks. During the first week I was part of a public health brigade, which consisted of putting concrete floors, an eco-stove, a latrine, shower and water storage unit into a home. We then spent time educating the community on common health and hygiene issues. The second week was the medical brigade. During this time, I shadowed doctors in the clinic, worked in the pharmacy station, and did intake tasks like taking blood pressure and patient histories., Undergraduate Student Instructor As an Undergraduate Student Instructor, I held a weekly three hour review session for students in Hormones and Behavior. I took this class in Spring 2012 and decided to be a Undergraduate Student Instructor for Spring 2013. During the review sessions, I went over the material the professor had covered in lecture and answered any questions that students had., Shadowing I worked Dr. Sheikh at the UCSF Fresno medical center. He works in the gastroenterology department. I shadowed him both as he interacted with patients in the clinic and while he performed gastrointestinal procedures., Peer Health Exchange Health Educator In Peer Health Exchange, I taught mental health workshops to high school students. The workshop curriculum focused on explaining the most common mental illnesses among teenagers, their symptoms, and what teenagers could do if they recognized that someone had a mental illness. The workshops presented teens with mental health resources in the Bay Area. The curriculum also focused on explaining the stigma associated with mental illness and how students could take away from these negative connotations."

    "text": "I am re-applying to medical school because it is a critical point in the realization of a long-term goal I am dedicated to pursuing: becoming a medical doctor. I previously addressed the prompt of why I want to go to medical school by explaining how and why I came to commit myself to becoming a service-minded, people-oriented physician. The initial reasons--which I listed under my last answer--have not changed, but instead have only been reinforced by events that have occurred over this past year.  Even after four years as a biology major and now graduate I am still passionate for the field, especially that concerning the human body and its anatomy and physiology, which has stemmed into my interest in medicine. My continued exposure to various clinical and medical environments only increases my ambition to understand further by entering the field as a career. Now that I know more about medical school and its curricula, I believe that my hunger to learn and question will be sated by the ability to pursue medical research, and that studying medicine will challenge my current ideas and concepts of the world as I so eagerly hope. My steadfast conviction is that a profession in medicine will give me the opportunity to ultimately find purpose in service to others, allowing me to use all of these aspects of myself in a positive and constructive fashion.  I seek to work in a profession that serves people, because I find meaning in knowing that what I do is bettering the lives of others. I have realized that there are many other occupations beyond medicine that are service-minded, but I remain drawn to becoming a doctor. I continually see the need for capable individuals to become physicians--specifically, those willing to center themselves on the care of their patients. I know that I am such a person. While I have seen the dreadful effect that a lack of thorough, quality medical attention can have on patients firsthand, I have also seen the rejuvenating effect of the opposite. I have previously professed my intention of wanting to fulfill the need for patient-focused medical care as a future physician and described what it is to be the service-minded, people-oriented doctor I hope to become. I recently had the pleasure of shadowing such a physician, and instead of repeating what I detailed in my previous essay I hope to illustrate what such an individual looks like by describing what I observed.   This family doctor was wholeheartedly concerned with the health and overall wellbeing of his patients, whom he showed both respect and friendship. The kind interactions that transpired between him and his patients reflected the importance of the patient-physician relationship. He never hurried, but gave them all the time that was needed to understand expressed concerns and together discuss how he could best assist in treating the issues at hand, both health care related or not. He was their advocate when consulting with insurance companies. Many of the patients who visited him could not afford to pay--but he still saw them. He would frequently make hospital rounds and house calls if needed, to see to his patients that could not make it to the office. This physician treated every patient with the same careful consideration and attention, regardless of their age, physical appearance, temperament, and socioeconomic status. In turn, his patients esteemed and trusted him, and several told me that they had the utmost faith in his ability. Observing him gave me a tangible model that I aspire to emulate, further strengthening my resolve and commitment to becoming such a service-minded, people-oriented physician.  My experience with the application process over the past year has broadened my perspective on medical school greatly. I now see medical school as a stepping-stone, a beginning to my career as a physician that I am excited to start. The desire that I have to serve abroad in Spanish-speaking countries or otherwise, or even cross-culturally in the United States, is in many cases already a possibility for medical students. As a medical student I can also begin doing service projects in local communities, and in some instances I may be able to provide health care to those who are in need to enhance my own learning. In a few instances, public health research may be an option for me, something I have become increasingly interested in since I conducted my research project. As I have interviewed and interacted with other amiable applicants, I have become enthusiastic about studying and learning alongside other future physicians who share a similar vision for health care. While touring various medical schools I have also witnessed the camaraderie and community among the medical students, and I yearn to be a part of those who will be leading medicine into the future.  I have been afforded the opportunity to re-evaluate my decision to become a doctor over the past year, due to the uncertainty of my acceptance because of a late application. While the disappointment of numerous rejections was difficult, I have discovered that my resolve has not wavered. I have made mistakes and l have learned. Irrevocably, I remain committed to becoming that service-minded, people-oriented physician as I reach for this next step. Thomas Library Technical Services Student Assistant Although I normally work in Reference, I was hired by Technical Services over the summer due to budget restrictions. In Tech Services I worked behind the scenes at the Thomas Library: I cataloged books and other materials in our library's database and processed them to be put out on the shelves. I also helped process DVDs for Audio Visual. Additionally, I assisted with sending out Interlibrary Loan books, making copies, and with organizing files related to this service. Finally, I spent some time doing withdrawals and sorting through books that had been gifted to the library, organizing them by subject matter so they could be selected for library processing or donated to other organizations., SRMC Patient/Visitor Escort and Pharmacy Courier Volunteer As a Hospital Patient/Visitor Escort Volunteer I would direct patients and visitors to and from different areas of SRMC. I spent a lot of my time conversing with patients and hospital staff, in addition to being exposed to the entire spectrum of environments found within a hospital. I also would do errands for the pharmacy or laboratory. Later, as a Pharmacy Courier Volunteer, I was placed in the hospital's pharmacy to help with medication distribution. I regularly made rounds with my medication cart to deliver prescriptions to the different nursing stations, picking up any unused medication to be returned to the pharmacy. On occasion, I also made immediate medication deliveries., Thomas Library Reference Student Assistant As a student assistant for Thomas Library Reference department, I sit at the desk and answer the phone and basic questions of library patrons in addition to helping oversee the resources that are available in this department (computer lab, reference books, etc.). I also help students, faculty, staff, and other university members with finding research material before referring them to one of the Reference Librarians for further assistance. As an additional duty, I was put in charge of cataloging the school newspaper, The Torch, in the library's database along with indexing the Wittenberg alumni magazine. I am currently employed with the Thomas Library Reference Desk through July of 2014., RHC Adult and Pediatric Clinics Volunteer As a volunteer at both the Adult and Pediatric Medical Clinics of the RHC, I spent much of my time helping with creating, updating, and organizing the hardcopy medical files of patients. I also had the opportunity of shadowing physicians at both clinics for a period of time, and thus was able to observe the interaction between physicians and patients of a wide variety of ages in a clinical setting. Additionally, I was able to participate in an evening session where nurses interacted with children patients who had behavioral problems. During this evening session, the children were able to participate in fun and engaging activities that helped build better behavioral habits., Spring Break Community Service Trip to Cary, Missippi During time off for Spring Break I was accepted to go on a week-long community service trip to the Mississippi Delta, an area with a high poverty rate. I helped out at the Cary Christian Center in Cary, Mississippi with Dr. Waggoner and other fellow students from Wittenberg University. At the Center, I spent time doing a variety of volunteer activities, such as gardening, after school programs with children, and medical file organizing. I also was allowed to sit in on a health education class that local nurses conducted with pregnant and expectant women at the Center. Additionally, I was able to tag along and observe a local home visit where a social worker was checking up on a new mother., Academic Honors Societies Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Delta Pi I belong to two academic honorary societies, Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Delta Pi. I was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa Omicron of Ohio chapter in April of 2013 as a junior. My senior year, in May of 2014, I was inducted into the Lambda Iota chapter of Sigma Delta Pi, which is specifically a Spanish honorary society. The faculty representative for Phi Beta Kappa at Wittenberg University is Frederick Tiffany (ftiffany@wittenberg.edu), and the faculty representative for Sigma Delta Pi is Christine McIntyre (cmcintyre@wittenberg.edu)., Honors/Awards/Recognitions from Wittenberg University I have received a variety of awards, honors and recognitions during my time at Wittenberg University. Over all four years I received a competitive full-tuition scholarship that was based on academic merit, an essay, and an interview with faculty. I was recognized as a Presidential Scholar as a junior, which garnered a $1,500 scholarship, and I was also given the Kurt J. Fickert Award in Spanish that year. The department of Biology elected me as showing Outstanding Achievement in Biology as a junior and senior, which was attached to a $100 award each time. Finally, my senior year I received Departmental Honors in Biology and University Honors, and I graduated summa cum laude from Wittenberg., Biology Peer Mentor for Introductory Biology Course I was asked by one of the Biology professors at Wittenberg University, Dr. Matthew Collier who is also my Pre-Health Advisor, to work with the introductory Biology (BIOL-170) students as a peer mentor. As a peer mentor, I sat in during class sessions and took notes with the students, then developed a review session with handouts each week for students to attend and discuss class material with me. The students also had direct access to me through email regarding any questions or problems that they might encounter with the course, from how to prepare for the exams to answering questions about the subject matter itself. As I did this outside my own academic pursuits, this was a paid position., Independent Research for Honors Thesis, Biology Department On my transcript from Wittenberg University this shows up as 2 semester hour credits under Honors Thesis/Project, the culmination of my participation in the Honors Program. I constructed and conducted an independent research project with my faculty advisor Dr. Cathy Pederson in line with her current research with human participants. I used an MRI database and other records on the participants for my project, entitled Sexual orientation in adult females not linked to second to fourth digit length ratios, average whole brain area or average cortical area. I examined potential correlations between sexual orientation and brain and digit morphology, in relation to androgen exposure in utero., Internship with Family Physician Dr. Kevin Macy, D.O. On my transcript from Wittenberg University this shows up as a 1 semester hour credit under Clinical Internship, as part of the same program that I was accepted into with Dr. Vijay Chitkara. This time I was placed with a local family physician, Dr. Kevin Macy, based on the interest I had expressed for family medicine. Dr. Macy is part of a larger Christian-based practice in Springfield, Ohio known as Springfield Center for Family Medicine. I went in once a week to observe him interact with patients and staff and wrote weekly reflection journals. I learned much about what it would be like to be a privately practicing family physician working alongside other practitioners in a large office., Internship with Pediatrician Dr. Vijay Chitkara, M.D. On my transcript from Wittenberg University this shows up as a 1 semester hour credit under Internship. Essentially, it was a clinical internship which I was accepted into through a program that my university conducts every semester. I was placed with a local  pediatrician, Dr. Vijay Chitkara, based on my interest in pediatrics. Dr. Chitkara has a private practice in Springfield, Ohio known as Nova Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. I went in once a week to observe him interact with patients and staff and wrote weekly reflection journals. I learned much about what it would be like to be a privately practicing pediatrician versus a pediatrician practicing in a clinical setting., 12th Ohio Latin Americanist Conference One of my former Spanish professors, Dr. Blanco, asked me to join him and a few other Wittenberg students in creating a panel for this conference, hosted at our university, using the material we had studied during our summer experience abroad. We had traveled that summer to both Argentina and Chile, and our focus was on the state terrorism that had occurred in both countries and its impact on the memory of individuals affected. My focus was the book/testimony by Nora Strejilevich, Una sola muerte numerosa, and I developed a thesis related to how she recounts the events from a gendered perspective. For the panel, I wrote a paper and then presented my findings at the conference all in Spanish.,  Retail, Course Research Article Published in Wittenberg's SPECTRUM SPECTRUM is a publication of writing at Wittenberg, specifically a journal of nonfiction prose encompassing a broad array of subjects. I submitted a revised research article from my Biological Literacy course for potential publication in Spectrum 2013, Volume 27 and was accepted. The title of my piece was Investigation of Various Major Pathways, Specifically Oral, Intravenous, and Blood Routes, through which Human Prion Infectious Agent which Causes Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) Could be Transmitted Using Primarily Sheep and Primate Models, on p. 46-59. I was told that I was one of the first hard-science pieces to have been accepted and published by the student journal., Church Mission Trip to Piedras Negras, Mexico The church that I attend, First Christian Church in Springfield, Ohio, organized a mission trip for the College and Young Adult age group to go and help our missionaries in Piedras Negras, Mexico. We spent about twelve days total on the trip, and ten of those days in Mexico doing a variety of activities for this Mexican community, from helping build a section of a concrete-rebar wall around the compound of a neighborhood to delivering food to family and friends of patients at a local hospital. We also conducted after-school activities for children at one of the local libraries and got to play with the kids afterwards there and in local neighborhoods, in addition to visiting two orphanages., Course Research Article Published in BGSU's Blogoteca No. 4 The paper which I composed and presented for the 12th Ohio Latin Americanist Conference caught the eye of an attending professor from Bowling Green State University, Dr. Valeria Grinberg Pla. She invited our entire panel to publish our papers as part of a dossier (entitled Estilística del Trauma: Memoria, género y archivo en el cine y la literatura de Chile y Argentina) in No. 4 of their online journal, Blogoteca. Our works were revised by us and our professor, Dr. Blanco, and published within the journal. My article is titled Otra mirada a Una Sola Muerte Numerosa: Las memorias de género y de victimización femenina and can be found at <http://blogs.bgsu.edu/blogotecababel/cuarto-no/>.,  Work Study (Library, Biology Department)"

    "text": "As the physician spoke, the patients eyes were fixed on me. The middle-aged, African American woman was very apprehensive about the medical community. However, severe abdominal pain forced her to seek emergency medical attention. Her frightened eyes widened as the physician explained the diagnosis and suggested gallbladder removal. Unexpectedly, the patient reached her hand out to me and asked, What do you think I should do \tAfter my initial shock, I explained that I was an undergraduate student who was unqualified to offer medical advice. I quickly realized, however, that she likely saw me- the only other African American in the room- as an ally who might be able to relate to her situation. Eager to be of service, I attempted to comfort her by acknowledging her fears and assuring her that the hospital would provide exceptional medical care. As I continued to hold her hand, she started to calm down. After reflection, I realized that applying medical knowledge is only one aspect of a physicians job. Communicating with cultural sensitivity and emotional understanding is equally important. Such clinical experiences enhanced my desire to become a physician, which had formed at a very young age. \tDuring my adolescence, I suffered from several medical problems. Whether for gastrointestinal surgeries or severe asthma attacks, I was hospitalized for extended periods of time. My interactions with medical doctors and nurses were always positive, and formed the basis of my initial attraction to the medical field. As a teenager, I wanted to become a pediatric pulmonologist because I understood the challenges that asthma posed in everyday life. I wanted to join a profession that would give me an opportunity to help children avoid these painful experiences. As I frequented asthma and allergy clinics throughout the St. Louis area, my desire to learn more about physicians increased. For example, I participated in a medical study at Cardinal Glennon Childrens Medical Center. Although I felt discomfort during pulmonary tests, I continued as a participant because I knew my data had the potential to help the researchers treat others. With access to such innovative medical care, my ailments were eventually diagnosed and treated.  \tMy personal experiences not only sparked a strong interest in healthcare, but also cemented my commitment to community service. In middle school, a tornado destroyed my familys home in Belleville, IL. While no one was there when the natural disaster struck, the aftermath was difficult to manage on our own. Only small mementos were salvaged from my room. We were forced to relocate because of the immense damage. The transition was made easier because community members offered their time and services to us, and we eventually returned to a normal life. The presence of friendly people offering food, basic resources, and helping hands to clean up our home made the traumatic experience more bearable. This support inspired my family to find ways to aid others.  \tOver the years, community service has fostered my personal growth in areas such as leadership and critical thinking. Because I understand how it feels to be vulnerable, I am empathetic toward people in need and one of my primary goals is to treat people with dignity. After volunteering in several different capacities, I discovered a passion for working with children. During mentoring sessions, I always have fun and learn something new. It is deeply gratifying to have a positive influence on children from underserved communities. Community service has enhanced my understanding of how best to approach the people and circumstances that I may encounter as a physician.  \tIn college, I pursued opportunities that confirmed my interest in and deepened my knowledge of the medical field. While I previously viewed medicine as a simple combination of science and service, shadowing physicians at Barnes-Jewish Hospital entirely transformed this perspective of medical care. Beyond experiencing the realities of hospital culture, I was able to converse with physicians about their worklife balance. In particular, I observed the effects of sleep deprivation and the stress that accompanies the fast-paced work environment. As I observed patient care, I frequently witnessed overcrowding and other issues that influenced patients hospital visits. In one instance, a physician was challenged to offer appropriate care as the incoming patient spoke Arabic and a translator was only available over the phone. In addition to shadowing, my coursework in physiology motivated me to continue my pursuit of a career in medicine. I enjoyed learning about the intricacies of the human body, and found that I could integrate information from several of my classes. Applying my knowledge to actual case studies was exciting. As I started to understand the functioning of organ systems, my desire to learn more and master the foundations of science increased.  \tThe human aspect of medicine was the original source of my motivation to become a physician. Now, the intellectual satisfaction of diagnosis and treatment also appeals to me. I hope to integrate my unique set of experiences with my passion for health, science, and service in order to contribute to the field of medicine. Association of Black Students As a member of the Celebrations Weekend Committee, we created a budget and coordinated entertainment for five hundred people. This annual event encouraged minorities to attend the university. I was a captain for Dance Marathon, a fundraiser for St. Louis Children’s Hospital. During Books and Basketball events, I provided academic and athletic mentorship to elementary students. As a host, my responsibilities were to accommodate and formally evaluate prospective students of the university. I utilized the formal mentoring program to advise and encourage underclassmen. This club allowed me to explore the intellectual and social aspects of Black culture and promote diversity on campus., Educational Interpreter As a member of the education department, my goal was to utilize animal exhibits and artifacts to facilitate a connection between the visitors and animals. When stationed at animal exhibits, I explained scientific topics and encouraged everyone to learn more about conservation efforts. During my shifts at the stingray exhibit, I illustrated the proper way to touch and feed stingrays and sharks. I obtained CPR certification and attended seminars to enhance my job performance. I also created presentations that provided informal educational opportunities for visitors. This job taught me how to resolve customer service issues and communicate with people of all ages., Big Sister (Mentor) Every week, I visited Daisha’s elementary school in University City, MO. We formed a meaningful relationship while playing games and discussing various topics. I supported her hobbies and attended school functions like plays and spelling bees. To improve our relationship, I consulted her teachers and our match specialist. After a year, our mentoring relationship switched from a school-based match to a community-based match. Subsequently, Daisha and I spent at least ten hours a month visiting St. Louis attractions like the Magic House and Six Flags. We also participated in community service events like For Kid’s Sake, a Big Brothers and Big Sisters’ fundraiser., MEDPREP Club I attend monthly meetings, participate in community service projects, and work at concession stands to raise money for the club. During a blood drive, I transported bags, test tubes, and donor records to the sorting area. I raised money and attended a heart walk that benefited the Carbondale Hospital. Also, I implemented activities to educate and entertain children during a community health fair. For the annual banquet, I chaired the decorations committee and contributed to board meetings. As a member of this club, my objective is to engage in dialogue with fellow pre-medical students and interact with the Carbondale, Illinois community., Club/ Intramural Basketball I was a co-captain on my intramural teams and helped the leadership of my club team. I contacted local colleges and helped organize a schedule for the club team. Club basketball allowed me to continue to play a sport that has contributed to my personal growth and development. Basketball taught me how to work with others to accomplish a goal., Harambe Christian Ministry I was a participant during weekly bible study sessions and monthly large group meetings. My task was to contribute to the dialogue about academic and personal struggles. For example, we talked about how to cope with homesickness. By addressing the major stressors that college students experience, I developed personal relationships with underclassmen and became an informal mentor. In addition to my involvement on campus, I represented the chapter and contributed to discussions during a regional conference. The fellowship sessions were a source of emotional and spiritual support for me., Research Assistant Laboratory’s research focused on how potassium channels influence physiology and behavior. My main responsibility was to conduct a weekly surgical procedure on African clawed frogs that included anesthetization, oocyte removal, and suturing. I acquired the skills that are necessary to execute basic experimental procedures like PCR. While consulting the graduate students, I prepared solutions and organized other materials that were utilized in their experiments. I maintained detailed lab notes, assisted with lab upkeep, and researched topics that were relevant to anatomy and neurobiology. This experience allowed me to learn how animal research can expand our knowledge of human disease., Research Assistant Laboratory’s research focused on the accuracy of peoples’ perceptions of personality. My main duty was to implement a research study that investigated self-knowledge. In addition, I entered data and audited previously collected information, watched and evaluated participants’ behavior during group interactions, and contributed ideas about coding schemes. I researched psychology related topics for personal knowledge and conducted literary searches for graduate students. I proposed new research studies and revised the current experimental design. As an upperclassman, I led group discussions during lab meetings and recruited and trained new research assistants., Minority Association of Pre-medical Students Our chapter held general body meetings and participated in community service projects. I interacted with attendees at several medical school admission panels and networking events. During an annual campus event, I hosted local high school students and encouraged them to consider a science related career. I represented the club and distributed water to participants of a prostate cancer walk. I was the captain for Relay For Life and Race for the Cure teams. Membership in the club gave me the opportunity to network with people in the St. Louis medical community and to gain knowledge and resources., Writing Mentor The center is designed to facilitate creativity and encourage self- expression. At the monthly workshops, I advised elementary students about literary techniques and conventions and encouraged them throughout the writing process. As a mentor, I provided feedback and one-on-one attention to each student in my small group. I adapted educational activities to fit the skill level of my mentees. Also, I was a chaperone on a field trip to a writing workshop at the local grocery store. This program is important because it enhances children’s writing skills and enables them to successfully communicate with others., Ralph Bunche Scholars Award The James E. McLeod Honors and Awards Program is held to recognize the achievements of Black students on campus. After maintaining a 3.5 GPA for three consecutive semesters, I received this award., Reading Mentor The program addresses the challenges of educationally disadvantaged youth. We utilize personal and small group tutoring sessions to improve the students’ reading skills and confidence. My role is to implement reading activities and consult the program director about innovative teaching methods. I dedicate extra time to prepare my mentees for special events like their Black History Month presentations and attend plays and other programs that showcase the students’ progress. I volunteer at this program because reading comprehension is fundamental to academic success. Also, I have witnessed some of the students’ positive behavioral changes once they improve academically., Y-Tutoring This weekly program was at the Jackie Joyner- Kersey Center in East St. Louis, IL. Our focus was on improving the students’ math and science abilities. The hands-on activities allowed the children to experience new methods of learning. I created activities that illustrated scientific concepts in a fun and simplistic manner. My participation in social activities allowed me to form relationships with the elementary students. In order to maintain a positive environment, I established and enforced rules. My goal was to demonstrate that learning is important, but the process can be fun. However, the program was discontinued when the center was temporarily closed., Shadowing Twice a month, I shadowed physicians in the Emergency and Trauma Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. As a Level 1 emergency department, this hospital provided services to a variety of patients from the Greater St. Louis area. My main focus was on observing the evaluation and treatment of patients’ basic and life-threatening medical issues. However, I also conversed with patients and consulted various members of the medical staff. After each shift, I reflected on my experiences and wrote brief notes. I completed HIPPA training, attended lectures about the medical field, and learned some medical terminology."

    "text": "Driving four hours to Kentucky to volunteer for the next three days was one of the last things I wanted to do that weekend. With homework and midterms piling up, and an internship on top of that, time was invaluable, and losing a whole weekend's worth of study time would mean a couple late nights next week. Nonetheless, I found myself arriving to The Center of Courageous Kids (CCK) with the other UC students on a Friday evening in February. CCK is a camp for children with life threatening illnesses. The kids and their families get to spend a weekend at camp, free of charge, to have fun, make friends, and forget about their troubles. As a volunteer there, I was assigned to a family as their camp counselor for the weekend. My job was to make sure the kids in my family had as much fun as possible. Ethan was the shy, seven-year-old little boy I was assigned to for the weekend. At first, Ethan didn't seem like he wanted to be there. He didn't want to sing and dance with the other kids and generally kept to himself. I tried as best I could to get Ethan more involved, but he was not interested. The camp staff was having much better luck. I was amazed by how devoted the staff was to all the kids there. They always went the extra mile to make sure these kids had the best possible experience, and always with a smile. Just looking at the camp, no one would be able to tell that these were seriously ill children running around and playing. That, to me, was very telling of the exemplary job the staff was doing. Though they weren't treating them in the medical sense, they were still helping these kids, improving their sense of well being. They were making a real difference for these kids. I went to bed that first night disappointed that I couldn't seem to help Ethan enjoy himself the way the staff was doing for the other kids. The care those kids received was in stark contrast to the care my brother received late last year. My brother has recurrent corneal erosion syndrome, an eye disorder that results in the exposure of sensitive corneal nerves, resulting in episodes of acute pain in the eye. After having a particularly painful episode one morning, my mom and I drove him over to the ophthalmologist's office. My mom went into the appointment with him while I waited outside. They came back out very agitated. My mom told me how she had tried to discuss new treatment options with the doctor because the current treatments my brother was using had not seemed to be very effective in preventing his episodes. However, the doctor seemed to move through the appointment as fast as possible, leaving little time for her to ask questions. Finally, the doctor had brushed her off at the end of the appointment, saying he did not have time to discuss further options and that she could make another appointment. I was floored. This was a problem that was becoming very stressful for my brother and the doctor seemed to show little care for improving his situation. Whenever I am helping someone out, I always remember these two experiences. I never want to make someone feel like I am only helping them, because it's my job to - which is how my mom felt with the ophthalmologist. They should not feel like they are a burden to my time. I want people to know that I truly care about helping them. Like the CCK counselors, I want to make sure that I am giving the best possible help I can give. I want to make sure that people can depend on me. I want to be someone people can trust and count on when help is needed. Even though I might initially be displeased at being called in or for an extra shift at work or asked by a friend to help out with their homework, I always feel satisfied after, knowing that I put in the extra effort needed. I want to make that extra bit of difference. Becoming a doctor would allow to me to be that person to the best of my abilities. More importantly, I would be able to do everything in my power to make my patient's health care experience the best it can be. I would be able to make sure that people didn't have the same experience my brother did with his ophthalmologist. As a doctor, I would have the opportunity to emulate the counselors at CCK; making a difference in the lives of sick people. As well, I would have the opportunity to try to make a difference in both their demeanor and in their physical condition. Although I would not get the same opportunity as the CCK counselors in terms of showing patients an amazing and fun time, I could do everything in my power to ensure that they get everything they can out of their visit or treatment. I can make sure that they feel comfortable in trusting my medical opinion and make them feel safe knowing that I am doing everything I can to help them. I want to be able to be that person for people. That is why I want to go to medical school. Eventually, I was able to get Ethan to come out of his shell. Turns out he loves piggy back rides. For the rest of the camp, he hardly wanted to leave my side (or my back). What started out as a begrudging trip to Kentucky turned into a pretty great weekend. Being able to see positive changes in patients will make the long hours and busy schedules of a career in medicine all the more worthwhile too. Assistant Teaching Assistant- Ecology Lab As an Assistant Teaching Assistant (ATA), my job was to assist the lab teaching assistant (TA) with teaching and helping Ecology students during their lab class. Lab classes met once a week for 2 hours and 50 minutes. During lab, I would keep students on task and answer any questions they had on the assignment they were currently working on. Additionally, I attended weekly TA meetings during my second semester. For each semester that I was an ATA, I lead one lab class, acting as the TA of the class, with the actual TA assuming an assistant role. From this I gained valuable experience in teaching a group of people about complex topics and how to keep a group of people on task., Assistant Teaching Assistant- Human/Comparative Anatomy Lab As an Assistant Teaching Assistant, I helped the class professor direct students during the lab portion of Human/Comparative Anatomy. The lab met once a week for 2 hours and 50 minutes. During the lab, students would dissect different organ systems of a mink specimen. Using my experience from taking the class myself, I would help students with their dissections and answer any questions they may have had while in lab. I would also help keep students on task, asking them questions about their dissection and making sure they understood what they were looking at. I would also help out at extra review labs held before lab practicals. I assisted in setting up the first lab practical of the year., Circle K International Circle K International is a worldwide college organization committed to to turning college students into a global network of leaders with a life long commitment to service. I have been a part of the University of Cincinnati Circle K club for my entire collegiate career. I served as the club's Membership Chair during my sophomore year, Treasurer during my junior year, and President during my senior year at the University of Cincinnati. During my time at Circle K, I expect to have completed around 180 hours of community service. I also expect to have complete 50 hours of time spent promoting the club and performing the duties required by my different officer positions.,  Food Service, SURF Capstone Poster Symposium I presented a poster of my work from my research internship at Cincinnati Children's Hospital (CCHMC) at the 2013 Capstone Poster Symposium run by the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program at CCHMC. My poster was the culmination of the work I did during my time in the Biomedical Research Mentoring Program in both the spring and summer of 2013. In performing and preparing for the presentation, I gained valuable experience in public speaking and in disseminating complex topics to a broad audience. These skills will be valuable in describing complex medical conditions to future patients. I was awarded an Honorable Mention by the judges at the symposium for my presentation., Shadowing Dr. Bradley Lisko I shadowed Dr. Bradley Lisko, MD for a few days in June 2014. I observed Dr. Lisko as he examined patients at his practice. While observing Dr. Lisko, I was able to notice his well formed relationships with his patients. His patients had complete faith in his treatment recommendations, and several told me that he was the best doctor they had ever had. From my time there, I was really able to learn the value of doctor-patient relationships and how they improve the whole health care process for the patient as well as help a doctor to care about what is in the best interest of the patient. It also showed me how getting to know a patient well can help in the diagnosing their health problems., Shadowing Dr. Helen Vafaie I shadowed Dr. Helen Vafaie, DO for a day. Dr. Vafaie is a psychiatrist with Visiting Nurses Association (VNA) of Ohio. She visits psychiatric patients that are referred to VNA at their homes. While with Dr. Vafaie, we visited 3 different patients, each with different psychiatric conditions. From this shadowing opportunity, I was able to learn a little bit about home health care and the psychiatric field. Dr. Vafaie was able to teach me a lot about the kind of patients a non-profit like VNA helps and how to act in patients' homes when making a home health visit. This shadowing opportunity definitely served to help me improve patient interaction skills and will be very useful moving forward., Shadowing Dr. Nina Kaushal, MD I shadowed Dr. Nina Kaushal, MD over a three day period. During my time with Dr. Kaushal, she was transitioning from primarily being a hospitalist to private practice. Thus, I got to observe her in both settings. One of the most valuable aspects of shadowing  Dr. Kaushal was her advice on how to interact with patients and how to professionally collaborate with other doctors. She spent a lot of time teaching me how to treat patients ethically. Dr. Kaushal also taught me how to perform several different small diagnostic tests using instruments such as stethoscopes and otoscopes. My time with Dr. Kaushal helped to form my interest in primary care and internal medicine., Tutor at Math Learning Center, University of Cincinnati I was a tutor for a semester at the University of Cincinnati Math Learning Center, a walk in tutoring center for students struggling with their math classes. I tutored four hours per week. As a tutor, I assisted University of Cincinnati students with comprehension and skills development in calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and elementary statistics. I would help students study for exams, work through homework problems and understand content. Through this experience, I learned valuable teaching skills as well as how to better articulate complex concepts to those who lack an expert knowledge on the topic. These communication skills have proved invaluable in group work settings in the classroom., Student Research, The Ohio State University I was able to enroll at The Ohio State University while in high school and perform a research internship in their Human Sciences Department during Spring Quarter 2011. The project I worked on used linkage analysis to try and locate the position of a mutation in a strain of S. pombe that prevented it from detecting cellular zinc levels. I was tasked with isolating RNA from S. pombe samples and performing Northern blotting on the isolated RNA. I presented a poster on the results of my work to students in my post-secondary program and their research mentors. I continued working unpaid in the same lab over the summer. My work resulted in being an author on a paper about the research project., Lerner Research Institute, Dept. of Immunology I was an unpaid research student in the Dept. of Immunology at the Lerner Research Institute. I worked on average 45 hours a week over a seven week period. The lab I was in focused on role of regulatory T cells in various inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease. I was primarily responsible for isolating intestinal epithelial and lamina propria cells from the small and large intestines of mice samples. I then used flow cytometry to analyze the composition and characteristics of the cell samples I collected. Additionally, I learned PCR genotyping and spent time trouble shooting the lab's genotyping protocol. I also observed many standard immunology lab techniques., Alpha Lambda Delta National Honor Society I was inducted into Alpha Lambda Delta (ALD) National Honor Society in March of 2012. As a member of ALD, I have attended many club socials, service events, and scholarship information meetings. From September 2013-May 2015, I have and will continue to serve as the club's Director of Scholarships. My responsibilities include running two scholarship meetings per semester and evaluating all scholarship applications we receive for national and chapter level scholarships. Planning scholarship meetings involves finding a guest speaker, ordering and picking up food, and preparing presentations on available scholarships. This valuable leadership experienced has helped develop my management skills., Treat Team Member at Rita's Italian Ice I worked as a Treat Team Member at Rita's Italian Ice. My primary responsibilities included greeting and serving customers and closing the store down during night shifts. Occasionally, I would be responsible for selling ice at out-of-store fundraisers and events. I also have experience in training new employees in product making and customer interactions. I would work 18-22 hours a week over the summer and varying schedules during the school year. During my time at Rita's, I was able to learn how to politely interact with a variety of different people through customer interactions and gained valuable experience working as part of a team. Training employees gave me valuable teaching skills.,  Student Research Trainee, Publication from Student Research at The Ohio State Univ. The research I did under Dr. Amanda Bird resulted in me being named as an author on the paper Zinc finger protein Loz1 is required for zinc-responsive regulation of gene expression in fission yeast (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1300853110). The research I performed directly contributed to the findings of the paper. Being an author represented a huge accomplishment for me. I enjoyed being able to contribute to the biological field. Being a part of an accomplishment like this helped to cement my interest in research and served as a catalyst for my pursuit of other research opportunities. The Total Hours reflects the hours I spent in the lab on work that contributed to the findings of the paper., Publication from Biomedical Research Mentoring Program The work I did at Cincinnati Children's Hospital through the Biomedical Research Mentoring Program contributed to the paper, A molecular atlas of Xenopus respiratory system development, resulting in me being named an author of the paper. My primary contribution was sectioning and photographing Xenopus embryos after in situ hybridization in order to examine different gene expression patterns. I was very excited to learn that my work had contributed to the findings presented in the paper. The Total Hours reflect the time I spent working in the lab, as noted in my Biomedical Research Mentoring Program activity section., Biomedical Research Mentoring Program Through the Biomedical Research Mentoring Program of the University Honors Program at the Univ. of Cincinnati, I was able to get a research internship in the Developmental Biology Dept. of Cincinnati Children's Hospital (CCHMC).

    "text": "One day when I was in elementary school, my dad surprised my brothers and me with a book of trivia to peruse at the dinner table. As my mom sighed and wondered why we didnt have normal dinnertime conversation, my family went through the book of trivia page by page. My three brothers and I would compete to guess correct answers for both obscure and obvious questions, ranging from geography to popular culture. This dinnertime ritual was one of the many ways my parents created an environment that encouraged learning and curiosity. Another way was through reading, which was something that my parents taught me to love by example. Throughout school I read constantly, finishing entire series of books. Although my reputation as a bookworm used to bother me, I now embrace my love of learning. My curiosity is the driving force of why I want to pursue a career in medicine. Throughout most of my childhood I never considered a career in medicine. Instead, I wanted to be a teacher like my mom. After the novelty of wanting to be a teacher wore off, my grandmother brought up the idea of being a doctor. My Aunt Laura, who I am named after, was an accomplished physician before she suddenly passed away in a car accident at the age of 33. The idea that we would share a name and a profession greatly appealed to my grandma. Although I had never considered medicine before, I had always enjoyed science. I appreciated that the field of medicine is constantly evolving and doctors are always learning new guidelines, techniques, and procedures. Knowing that I would be committed to lifelong learning, I began to think seriously about this option. I began to explore careers in medicine following my grandmothers suggestion, but it was not until I shadowed my own pediatrician that I truly made up my mind. Dr. Wozniaks brisk Polish accent used to intimidate me when I was a shy child, but as a college student I realized how brilliant she is. Watching her check her young patients development, reassure worried parents, and reason out problems appealed to both the compassionate and curious sides of me. I loved working with the kids, especially the very young ones. I remember watching a small girls face light up as I showed her how to listen to her own heart. The curiosity she exhibited reminded me of why I was exploring medicine in the first place. After this shadowing experience, I decided that medicine was the right choice for me. When I reflect on the aspects that I want to embrace as a physician, I think of two things: education and compassion. In my current position, I work as a scribe in an office of retina specialists. Although all of the physicians I work with are incredibly smart, some of the doctors are better educators than others. Each day I see looks of realization and appreciation wash over our patients faces when the doctor clearly explains what is happening to their vision and what the next step should be. Conversely, I notice their looks of confusion when the doctor does not adequately explain the situation. From these experiences, I have realized that I believe in being a physician who educates my patients. When something is not right in the body, it is scary and confusing. As a physician, I want to relieve as much of this fear and confusion as possible. I envision patients leaving my office with a clear understanding of their condition and course of action. My love of learning has led me to not only want to be a physician, but an educator.  The second quality I want to embody is compassion. Although I never met my Aunt Laura, I have been told countless times that she was a compassionate and empathetic person. My grandmother has a framed journal entry on her wall from my aunts final year of residency. In it, my aunt describes witnessing a man with AIDS passing away on Christmas Eve. She imagined that he thought the hospital choir caroling in the hallway was a group of angels from heaven, serenading him as he passed. I aspire to have this level of compassion. I have volunteered throughout college, but the experience that helped me realize the effect an act of compassion can have is volunteering in a hospice facility. I visited one man in the hospice facility many times in the months before he passed away. Each time I saw him he told me the exact same stories about his travels, his patented invention, and his family. By the third time I visited him I had these stories memorized, but I could not bear to change the subject. Despite his poor condition, I could tell that he was happy that someone cared about his life stories. These experiences have shown me that even small acts of kindness can have a meaningful impact, and I hope to continue spreading this compassion as a physician. I aim to make people happier and healthier, whether that is by tracking a patients health for years or meeting a patient once to do a surgery. There are many careers that involve helping people, but the combination of caring for others and learning continually is what draws me to medicine. I look forward to the opportunity to challenge myself to be even more motivated, compassionate, and curious. Scribe/Technician As a scribe and technician, I dilate and refract eyes, take medical histories, scribe for physicians during eye exams, prepare patients for injections, and much more. I have contact with patients all of the time, but also work closely with the doctors and learn a great deal about ophthalmology and the retina. I also learn about other aspects of being a physician such as insurance, billing, and how an office runs., Study Group Facilitator As a study group facilitator, I helped a small group of students learn general chemistry each week. This position required me to prepare creative activities and practice worksheets to create a discussion-based learning atmosphere. I became more comfortable speaking in front of a group and managing a class. This position also pushed me to become more articulate in explaining concepts. Through managing a class, I became more organized., Fundraising Committee Coordinator Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan (DMUM) is a student organization that raises money for pediatric rehabilitation through local hospitals. Throughout the year, students form bonds with kids who have disabilities. The year ends with students standing for 30 hours in a marathon. From 2010-2012, I was a dancer (member). I participated in many family events throughout each year as well as the marathon. In 2012-2013, I was a dancer captain, meaning I led a team of dancers and ensured that they fundraised enough money. In 2013-2014, I was a coordinator on the dancer fundraising committee. I planned initiatives to help other dancers raise money and reach their fundraising goals., Obstetritian/Gynecologist Shadowing I shadowed an OB/GYN because I am interested in learning more about the field. I gained an understanding of general gynecology and became more interested in the specialty., Pediatrician Shadowing I spent a few weeks shadowing my pediatrician, Dr. Maria Wozniak. Through this experience, I gained an understanding of primary care medicine. I observed Dr. Wozniak as she did physical exams, did minor procedures, and talked with patients. I spoke with patients frequently. This shadowing experience solidified my decision to pursue medicine., MCAT General Chemistry Teacher I teach general chemistry for the MCAT part-time. I plan engaging lessons and teach test-taking techniques for the MCAT through in-class practice passages. I hold office hours, help with promotional events for The Princeton Review, and answer questions through email at all times. Through this position, I have improved my public speaking skills and become comfortable explaining content and managing a class., Note-Taker In this position, I attended classes for students who had disabilities that prevented them from hearing or seeing well in lecture. I took notes during class and sent these notes to the students. This position required me to take clear and accurate notes and be very reliable in attending classes for other students., Social and Publicity Chair Medical Educational Service Opportunities (MESO) is an organization that provides medically-related volunteer, workshop, and trip opportunities. Each year, I participated in volunteering opportunities and attended workshops about different aspects of medicine. In 2011-2012 I was on the social and publicity committee. In 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 I was the Social and Publicity Chair on the executive board. I led a committee that planned social events and promoted the organization. We were in charge of recruiting members to MESO as well as recruiting trip-goers. In March of 2013, I was the leader of the spring break trip to Panama, where we set up clinics and provided healthcare for residents., Research Assistant My study investigated how the behaviors of parents of children with cystic fibrosis impact treatment adherence. My role in this research was coordinating all communication with each participating family, traveling to each family's home to videotape treatments, and coding these taped treatments for specific behaviors. I learned a great deal about applying behavioral psychology to clinical settings. Through this project, I became more organized, detail-oriented and comfortable talking to patients in a clinical setting., Hospice Volunteer My volunteer experience with Arbor Hospice allowed me to have one-on-one interactions with patients in a hospice facility. In addition, I worked at the hospitality desk greeting visitors and did office work. Through this volunteer experience, I became more comfortable speaking with people who were dealing with very difficult circumstances. I also gained experience speaking with patients in a clinical setting and observing how a hospice facility works.,  Ophthalmic Technician and Scribe, Romance Languages and Literatures Student Achievement Award The Romance Languages and Literatures Student Achievement Award is an award that is given based on academic achievement in the Spanish Department. Professors nominate students who have a GPA higher than 3.8 for the award based on class performance throughout college."

    "text": "There were fifteen minutes remaining until midnight and the conclusion of an eventful shift when the physician assistant approached with a minor request. Do you think you could see this woman in Room 31 without me I saw her last week... She is drug seeking and I just dont want to deal with it again.        Dr. J.S. agreed to see the new patient on his own and subsequently obtained her prescription drug record through a regional reporting system. He placed the neatly folded printout in his back pocket and proceeded to Room 31, closely trailed by my clunky computer-on-wheels. Offering a genuine smile and respectful handshake, the physician asked, What brings you into the emergency room tonight        The patient was a sixty-four year old female with a surgical history of thoracic spinal fusion complaining of back pain. She stated she ran out of pain medications and confirmed, after numerous inquiries, that a pain specialist had never evaluated her. Dr. J.S. asked the woman and her spouse several thoughtful questions, listened intently, and delivered considerate responses. Finally, the moment arrived: he withdrew the sheet of paper and read aloud the dates and details of recent prescriptions from a pain specialist. Dr. J.S. explained the legal implications for both he and the patient should he provide an additional prescription, yet maintained a sincere sense of concern and respect. Although they did not accomplish their original objective, the patient and spouse expressed gratitude for the visit and the staff discharged them without issue. The affability and equanimity with which the physician conducted himself were quite impressive. Originally anticipating a tense consultation, I was relieved to have the opportunity to witness such an instructive moment. This is the kind of physician I strive to become, one who effectively balances the art and science of compassionate care throughout all situations.        Working as an emergency department scribe provided an exceptional glimpse into the dynamics of the patient-provider relationship and medicine in general. While observing physicians and nurses, I felt eager to be in their positions directly tending to patients. For instance, I frequently ran off to obtain water or warm blankets for patients and families when the nurses were occupied and unavailable, tasks that were outside the scope of my standard documentation duties. These occasions brought me joy and energy to endure through the long, busy hours. Furthermore, I noticed that elderly, chronically ill, and terminally ill patients sometimes appeared troubled or lonesome in search of a more profound sense of care than they might receive in an emergency room. This observation led me to seek out service work with a local hospice organization as a companionship volunteer.        Although slightly intimidating at first, my experiences with hospice patients became so much more rewarding and meaningful than expected. One particular individual, John, especially influenced my notions of compassion. At ninety-two years of age, his mind was sharp and wistful but his hands were unable to transcribe his rich memories due to Parkinsons disease. Each week, John reminisced and disclosed his interesting life story while I scribbled into an old notebook. By our fourth visit, John discussed his lifelong battle with depression and prior suicidal ideations, and we spoke openly about death and dying. His candid trust in me was invigorating and I embraced our friendship despite the daunting dialogue. In return for the printed booklet with all of his recollections and reflections, John insisted on offering me his copy of the 1990 Mayo Clinic Family Health Book. His delight in having his memories recorded was palpable and this act of gratefulness was touching. These experiences helped enhance my listening skills and heightened my appreciation for building rapport with others. As the journey into medicine continues, my hope is to develop these skills and foster constructive relationships with patients.       After reflection upon time spent in the emergency department, similarities to the research environment became apparent. My simultaneous independence and collaboration in the lab was comparable to the balanced teamwork of an emergency staff, and both settings cultivated and necessitated critical and creative thinking. Despite spending hours focused on manipulating a 30-micron inner diameter capillary to aspirate an 8-micron neuronal cell, I never lost sight of the larger aim to improve electrophoretic separations. Similarly, physicians attended to the alleviation of acute symptoms but kept long-term treatment in mind. My passion and energy expended in the laboratory shall benefit a clinical path considering that various competencies are transferable.       Regardless of the original inspirations that drew me to medicine as a young girl, several valuable experiences have evoked the diligence and insight to continue pursuit of this goal. These experiences have taught me so much about myself; I am most elated while serving others in a restorative way. Though the organic causes of disease will not always be ameliorated, I look forward to treating and healing the patient as a whole person. Special Olympics Notre Dame Between February and April 2011, I volunteered with Special Olympics by helping to coach a basketball team in the South Bend community. Team members had a range of mental disabilities and varied in age from eight to fifty-five years old. Between September and December 2013, I participated in pick-up basketball on Sunday afternoons on campus. Children and adults from the surrounding area with disabilities came to enjoy themselves and practice basketball in a casual setting. I helped by playing with these athletes both one-on-one and in groups. Perseverance and emotional intuition were useful skills when certain children required motivation and additional attention., Eucharistic Minister During my residence in Pangborn Hall, I participated as a Eucharistic Minister at the masses in our chapel. The Eucharistic Minister is the person who distributes the communion (bread and wine) during a Catholic mass. I had previously undergone training for this position in high school and was interested in continuing in college. Contributing to my residence hall through this religious route was a unique way to become involved and connect with others., Intramural Volleyball Captain of Pangborn Hall During my sophomore year in Pangborn Hall, I assumed the role as captain of our intramural volleyball team after playing with commitment and enthusiasm the year prior. This position involved leading and organizing the Pangborn team, relaying game information, and communicating with RecSports and other team captains. Although our team did not make it to the intramural championships, we had a wonderful time practicing together and competing against our friends in other residence halls., Multicultural Commissioner of Pangborn Hall During my sophomore year, I served as the Multicultural Commissioner of my residence hall, Pangborn. The responsibilities involved planning monthly activities that would foster multiculturalism and education. Some of the events I planned while in the position included a Hispanic heritage celebration, a talk about immigration and education by a Latino Studies professor, a Chinese New Year celebration with a lecture by a Chinese professor, and origami folding with the Japan Club for a local children’s hospital. I even cooked an enormous meal with the help of other dorm residents for Italian night. Serving the Pangborn Hall community through this leadership role was enjoyable and entertaining., 2013 Scribe of the Year Award Each year, ScribeAmerica honors an employee from each of their offices or departments for exceptional performance. My supervisors chose me as the recipient of this award for our emergency department at St. Joseph Regional Medical Center. The award recognized work ethic, dedication, and professionalism. The chief scribes frequently sent me encouraging feedback from physicians and staff about my hard work, positive attitude, and charting ability. I was surprised and delighted to receive acknowledgment for a job I valued so much.,  Emergency Department Scribe,  Full-time Volunteer; Charitable Pharmacy Patient A, Hospice Companionship Volunteer Harbor Light Hospice provides care and support to patients and their families during the final stages of life. As a volunteer, I was part of the hospice core team along with nurses, social workers, chaplains, etc. I chose to serve through direct patient care, providing emotional support and friendship to patients and families. Visits to patients at their homes or facilities typically consist of talking, watching television, or playing games. Harbor Light considers volunteers to be crucial in the caring process by providing companionship rather than any sort of technical or medical assistance. Over several months, I visited three patients at their assisted living or nursing facilities., Procter and Gamble Research and Development Intern I worked specifically in the Personal Healthcare Analytical Department. Over ten weeks, I handled three distinct assignments with the overall goal of predicting and modeling the stability of Vicks active pharmaceutical ingredients. One project tested the chemical and physical stability of new DayQuil and NyQuil products that were ready for release on the market. My second task assessed the chemical stability of several other active ingredients with varying excipients, contributing to upstream product development. My third project involved forecasting phenylephrine stability in liquid formulations. A majority of the chemical analysis was completed via high performance liquid chromatography., Undergraduate Research In the fall of my sophomore year, I joined Dr. Norman Dovichi’s bioanalytical chemistry research group. The group has two main projects that are quite different: the study of metabolic pathways in neuronal cells and proteomics. Throughout my time in the lab, I was able to contribute to both projects under the guidance of two graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher. During my early years with the group, I studied glycosphingolipid metabolism in single cells via capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence. For the summer of 2013, I was awarded a Notre Dame College of Science Undergraduate Research Fellowship to continue this work and begin proteomic investigations., Choreographer for Latin Expressions La Alianza (recently renamed the Latino Student Alliance) is a student-run organization that promotes the interests of Hispanic/Latino Notre Dame students. I first joined the club as a freshman. The annual signature event hosted by La Alianza was “Latin Expressions,” a variety show that demonstrated the talents and passions of students. While planning the spring 2012 show, the club officers asked me to help choreograph the opening act. The time spent creating and teaching the massive dance number (with merengue, cha-cha, tango, bachata, and salsa) was challenging, exciting, and rewarding. This was a wonderful opportunity to contribute to the community in a creative and enjoyable way., Ivy Insiders Branch Manager Revolution Prep is a standardized test preparation company that recruits students from top colleges for their Ivy Insiders program. The program provides support so that students can establish their own tutoring businesses in their home communities. In the Long Island region, I marketed, sold, managed, and taught my own SAT prep course. I also tutored several students privately. Many challenges arose in this job, including the resignation of my co-manager and trouble finding an affordable classroom. However, my regional manager recognized me as Branch Manager of the Week in the third week of June for my extensive advertising efforts. I am thankful for the business and teaching experience., Emergency Department Scribe ScribeAmerica provides medical scribes in various different healthcare facilities and settings. In the emergency department, I worked alongside an emergency physician throughout his or her entire shift and performed all charting in real-time. This involved recording the patient’s history of present illness, review of systems, and physical examination; importing radiology and lab results; detailing the medical decision making and disposition; and documenting any other elements of the patient encounter. Overall, the use of scribes helps to increase physician productivity and improve quality time spent with patients., Co-authored Article in Talanta The full citation is as follows:  Keithley, R.B., Metzinger, M.P., Rosado, A.M., Dovichi, N.J. Manipulating ionic strength to improve single cell electrophoretic separations. 2013. Talanta 111: 206-214.  This article was the result of research completed in the Dovichi group. It was published in Talanta, a journal in pure and applied analytical chemistry. Our goal was to improve the separation efficiency and resolution of single cell separations on our capillary electrophoresis system with two-color laser-induced fluorescence detection. Modifying the ionic strengths of buffer compositions enhanced our separation quality., Co-authored Article in Analytical Chemistry The full citation is as follows:  Keithley, R.B., Weaver, E.M., Rosado, A.M., Metzinger, M.P., Hummon, A.B., Dovichi, N.J.

The research project involved collaboration with Dr. Amanda Hummon's group. Three-dimensional HCT 116 cell culture systems were grown and incubated with fluorescently labeled glycosphingolipids. Some populations were treated with a lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine. Distinct spheroid regions were probed for single cell metabolism via capillary electrophoresis., Latino Honor Society Vice President The mission of the Latino Honor Society of Notre Dame is to promote academic excellence and service, especially in the Latino community, and to encourage the unity of Latino scholars by providing a forum for academic achievement. Students are eligible for honorary status if they maintain a certain GPA and perform more than the minimum amount of community service and cultural enrichment activities. I was inducted with honorary status in the fall of 2013 and named the Vice President for the spring 2014 semester. My responsibilities included organizing and holding meetings, planning events, arranging volunteer activities, preparing the annual budget, and communicating with society members., Development Phone Center Student Caller Work in the development phone center involved calling alumni and friends of the University of Notre Dame in support of fundraising efforts. I appreciated this unique job experience because it improved my communication skills and confidence. Each evening, students called hundreds of alumni and engaged in conversation. For the most part, alumni were willing and pleased to speak with current students about Notre Dame memories, current events, or the status of our football team. Even if people did not feel inclined to donate money, I was able to engage them in thoughtful and cheerful conversation."

    "text": "I did not always want to attend medical school. In fact, the first career I aspired to as a child was a taxi cab driver. Helping people get to where they needed to go while being able to meet new an interesting people every day seemed like an amazing thing to do. Although my career aspirations have changed, this desire to help others on a daily basis, along with influence from the many doctors that have been a part of my life, are some of the primary reasons I wish to become a medical doctor.  Since I was born, I have been hindered by a multitude of medical issues. I was born with amblyopoia and legally blind in my left eye, and this went untreated until I was almost six. Upon visiting an optometrist, she not only instructed me on how to treat my eye but also helped ensure eye screenings at the preschool I attended to help future children. It was satisfying to know that other children could receive help even sooner than I did thanks to my optometrist's efforts, and this was truly my first experience of a doctor going above and beyond simple diagnosis and treatment.When I also learned that I had a fatal tree nut allergy not too long after, I was fortunate enough to have an allergist that took the time to ensure I understood everything about this allergy, and the implications it would have on my life. About a decade later, another doctor helped guide me through my migraines that started occurring in high school, and coached me in ways I could help prevent migraines and helped investigate what their possible cause could be. Throughout my life various doctors all went out of their way to give me the best care possible, and made me feel like more than merely a patient. I wanted to be able to share that experience and help other people in a similar fashion.  Even though medical doctors were a positive influence in my life, I was not convinced immediately that this was the career path I wished to pursue. There really was no epiphany moment for deciding my career path, but rather a sequence of events that led up to it.When I became a lifeguard, I knew that I wanted to do a job that would involve direct contact with people, and not be stuck in a back room the entire day. However, to me being a lifeguard was a very boring job, and having only ever performed two rescues in five years of it. I knew I wanted a job that was more directly involved with communicating and helping people, and not merely guarding them. I was always highly interested in science, specifically life sciences, which inspired my choice of a biochemistry major. It allowed me to focus on coursework related to the medical field (which by this point I had a growing interest in) but still offered various opportunities would I have decided to pursue another career path. Throughout my studies in biochemistry, I found much of the material interesting, but I could not see myself making a career out of working in a laboratory 24/7.  Ultimately, it was once my sister convinced me to shadow a doctor she worked with in the emergency room roughly one year ago that I truly felt devoted to attending medical school. It applied all the aspects of a career that I wanted. It was a field with a strong focus on scientific analysis and study, but focused on people instead of raw laboratory data. I felt the work that was being done in the emergency room was truly helping people there in front of me. It was something that I knew I wanted to be a part of, and wanted to devote myself to achieving. James A. Kritzler Memorial Premedical Scholarship An honorary scholarship awarded annually to one upperclassmen in the chemistry department pursuing a career in medicine. Its recipient is chosen by members of chemistry department faculty., Delta Sigma Phi House Manager As House Manager, I was responsible for house maintenance, cleanliness, restocking house supplies, and any major housing improvement projects for the fraternity house. This included supervision of events such as house cleanup, family day, and housing inspections. Additionally, as a member of the fraternity executive board I was responsible for managing many aspects of the fraternity as a whole in addition to being a member of the alumni corporation board, which managed the finances and property of the fraternity. Additionally, I have served as social chairmen (who organizes socials with other greek life organizations) and standards chair (who helps with university mandated paperwork., St. Rita's Future Hospital Volunteering As I am now a registered volunteer with St. Rita's, I plan to continue my hospital volunteering experiences throughout my senior year in the emergency department or wherever else I am needed. The number of volunteer hours I have provided are a rough estimate for weekend volunteering over my senior year and could be higher or lower by May 2015. I wished to indicate my projected volunteer hours separate from my completed volunteering hours., Independent Study Beyond my required academic labs, I participated in an independent study project analyzing the effectiveness of titrating avidin with fluorescein-biotin as an analytical technique. After researching this topic for most of the year, analyzing and accounting for different variables, I prepared a written report of my results., St. Rita's Hospital Volunteer During these hospital volunteering hours, I followed either a physician or physician's assistant throughout the ER and assisted where necessary, such as helping with observation or data collection from patients, and communicated with the hospital patients where appropriate., Lifeguard I served as a lifeguard responsible for safety of pool patrons, maintaining pool equipment and cleanliness, and operating attractions such as the waterside. I was certified through the American Red Cross in lifeguard rescue skill, first aid, and CPR., Science Fair Judge I served as a science fair judge for the Auglaize bible church K-12 science fair. This involved going from exhibit to exhibit, asking the children to present their projects, and scoring each exhibit and deciding the science fair winners., Chemistry Lab Teaching Assistant I served as a teaching assistant in both general chemistry and organic chemistry labs, aiding in preparing academic labs, helping students with setup and lab procedure, maintaining a safe lab environment, and grading lab reports outside of lab time.  I will additionally be a biochemistry lab T.A. in Fall 2014., Frontier Day Camp Counselor I served as an assistant Counselor, where I assisted senior counselors both in running camp activities and supervising campers. Typically, I would be assigned responsibility for 1 to 2 campers during a given activity or asked to help demonstrate and participate in camp functions. Since many campers were autistic or had other learning disabilities, they often required this special, individual attention to help them gain the most from camp., Geauga Hospital Emergency Room Shadowing I shadowed Dr. Culver throughout a shift in the ER department at Geauga Hospital, watching how the ER operates. I assisted Dr. Culver as needed with basic tasks such as handing tools during surgical procedures or conversing with patients when appropriate., Shadowing in a Primary Care Setting I shadowed Dr. Price in a primary care setting for one shift, observing patient care and talking to patients about their reasons for visiting while being instructed about aspects of primary care by Dr. Price., Research with Sandia National Labs at UNM I worked as a summer temp intern for University of New Mexico in the Advanced Materials Lab (funded by Sandia National Laboratories), performing any tasks needed to assist Dr. Kemp, the post-doc Jerome Lisena, or any of the graduate students in chemical research based primarily on the utilization of molecular oxygen as an oxidizing agent in palladium diphosphene ring structures.

    "text": "A doctor is able to make an immediate difference in a child's life. A doctor is able to not only help heal someone physically, but emotionally and mentally. More than anything, I want to be a pediatrician. My whole life I have loved working with children, finding ways to teach them, and putting their guardian's mind at ease that they are in the best hands possible. I have been a babysitter since before I can remember. Working with children has always made me happy, and nothing is more rewarding than seeing the positive impact that you can have on their lives. This is most apparent in the two girls I have watched every summer since I was 15 years old. Lylah and Olivia have lived with their grandparents since their mother was imprisoned in 2007. Looking at them, you would never expect all of the hardships that those girls have been through. Lylah remembers when her mother's boyfriends would steal the television and silverware. Olivia once asked, What's a mommy  I have loved being there for these girls more than anything else in my life. I have learned to talk through important issues with them and constantly be the cool nanny that they can come to with any problems. And I want to continue to do more than just watch children while their parents are at work. I want to know exactly how to make them better when they are sick, to be a comfort to them, to calm their parents and help them understand what is going on, to physically heal them.   The worst feeling in the world is when you look at a sick child and are not able to help them feel better because you do not know what to do. I want to be there for those parents who are panicked  and show them what to do. As a pediatrician, I will be able to discuss the problem with the parent and show them all the options. I come from a family of teachers, so I have grown up finding different ways to explain concepts and help people understand them. Parents face their nightmare when they do not understand what is happening to their child, and I hope to end that nightmare by explaining exactly what is happening. Besides what the parent feels, I also think I will be great at explaining what is happening to the children themselves. I am currently an undergraduate teaching assistant a the University of Louisville for Biology 244, the introductory lab for biology majors. Of course, freshmen in college are much older than most of my patients would be, the fundamentals are very similar. Both roles would require me to find explanations that work best for each person, and each require me to see what is or is not working in order to change my approach for the best results.  A good doctor is able to do more than just explain what is happening to the patient. Along with that, a great doctor must be able to convince his or her patient to follow through with the medication or life style choices that are best for them. And of course, the doctor must have patience when their patient does not follow their instructions. I have recently had the privilege of being elected Delta Zeta, Beta Gamma Chapter, Ritual Chair. This job has taught me to be patient and understanding more than any other leadership position I have held. Not only must I plan meticulously in order to ensure that the ritual runs smoothly, but I also must work with the girls with parts to make sure they know them and make all the other girls attend ritual in proper attire. This takes planning and compromise when trying to make college girls wake up early on a Saturday morning or convincing them to give up a night on the town in order to be prepared for an important event. It has taught me to present what is best for someone in a way that they will chose to do that rather than an irresponsible event that may be more fun. This skill will be extremely important as a doctor some day.   I want to be a doctor because I feel that I have the skills necessary to help people. I am an extremely hard worker. I have worked hard to raise enough money to fund both of my trips out of the country. Each of my trips to Costa Rica and Ireland showed me the amazing benefits that you can receive when you work hard and give everything all you have. My family has not always had it easy financially so I knew that I needed to work hard not only in jobs, but also in school to be able to receive a scholarship so that I could attend college. When I set my mind to something, I do not give up until I have achieved it. I want to be a pediatrician more than anything else in my life,and I will continue to work hard and do my best to ensure that this dream becomes a reality. Alpha Epsilon Delta Honors Pre-medicine Society Alpha Epsilon Delta is an honors pre-medicine fraternity. To remain an active member, you must attend all meetings, 3 forums, and 3 service activities each semester. Forums involve guest speakers from many different medical fields to discuss various topics., Gold Key Honors Society An honors society. Sign up as groups for various service activities. Attend general body meetings each semester., Bartender and Waitress As the bartender, I worked the entire bar by myself from taking orders, running the food, answering the phone, talking to customers, pouring drinks, cleaning, doing dishes, and prepping for the day. As waitress, I was again alone in the front and responsible for taking orders, taking calls, running food, cleaning, restocking, sweeping, handling all the customers, and either opening or closing, depending on my shift., Nanny During the summer while Olivia and Lylah were out of school, I watched and took care of them while their grandparents were at work. I was responsible for feeding them, driving them to various practices, entertaining, cleaning, and anything else that needed to be done., Dean's List I have been on the Dean's List at the University of Louisville many times for high academic achievement., Dr. Kelly I shadowed Dr. Kelly on his rounds with the newborn babies. I observed his interactions and I help examine the infants., Dr. Shearer I shadowed Dr. Shearer on his procedure day. I observed 22 small surgeries., Undergraduate Teaching Assistant I was there to assist the Graduate Teaching Assistant in any way that they needed and talk to the students to help them understand the concepts and serve as a less intimidating teacher from which they could ask help. I was also responsible for teaching one third of all the lecture material and demonstrating the activities and experiments. Also, a meeting each week with the supervising faculty to discuss material and techniques., Interfaith Center I work as an office staff member. I man the front desk, welcome and direct people, set up for events, and keep the building clean and organized.

    "text": "Walking a new mother to her room at St. Joseph Hospital Family Medicine Center, I was overwhelmed with emotion. The mother of this six-day-old boy, who could barely fit in my hands to be weighed and measured, totally entrusted me with an unconditional love known only to parents.   Moments like these fill me with compassion, rewardingly complement the rigor of my undergraduate science courses, and sustain my passion for entering the medical field.          In hindsight, there was some form of impetus in my childhood to pursue medical school.  Though my story is not uncommon, in that I was raised by a low-income single mother, the physicians of my story were quite uncommon.  My mother was hellbent on ensuring I made every doctors appointment, checkup and physical examination.  Fortunately for us, Dr. Selby at ECHO Community Health Care had a passion for providing access to medicine for those who could not always afford it, and he did so with the utmost humility. Even as a young teenager, I was conscious of the impact he made on my mother, who at the time was financially and emotionally stretched beyond comfort.         In an effort to further understand poverty and in some way reproduce this physicians graceful service, I have intentionally sought opportunities that would expose me to emotionally uncomfortable and discussion-provoking circumstances.  During two mid-semester breaks, I served as a site leader for seventeen other students in a home-repair group that worked primarily in the flood- stricken areas of the Appalachian Mountain region.   I spent the summer before my junior year in New York City teaching and mentoring underprivileged middle school students predominantly from immigrant families. Currently, I am supplementing my service with an element of medicine, volunteering this summer as a Unite for Sight Global Impact Fellow with ophthalmologists and other health professionals providing eye care in Ghana.         The experiences have provided an opportunity not only to feel compassion for the sacrifice and service of another, but also to better understand the mechanisms of social issues, like the effects of wealth disparities on education and social capital.  Acknowledging and appreciating this dichotomy has helped me identify a certain niche for which I might want to offer my skills as a physician in the future. Providing compassionate healthcare transcends prescriptions and surgeries; it requires an acute and comprehensive understanding of social trends and societal problems.          Similar to my service experiences, my decision to transfer and transition to a new college after my freshman year challenged me to learn, grow, and then strive in a new environment. Transferring to the University of Notre Dame from Wabash College was demanding and forced me to practice flexibility while adjusting and exemplifying discipline in my more competitive classes. My GPA sophomore year illustrates this tough transition, but I worked incessantly to overcome the associated setbacks and earned higher grades during my junior year. Surmounting the challenges that accompanied transferring will translate during my transition to medical school.         Although I understand both the demands of a career in medicine and that I am a somewhat traditional applicant to medical school, I assert my preparedness and passion. Given the types of diverse experiences I have undertaken, especially those at the crossroads of medicine and service, I know that I am equipped to more fully appreciate the potential positive impact a physician can have on the lives of the individuals in his or her community. These experiences have helped me to mature in a way that education could not do alone. Complementing my education with service has cultivated my cultural awareness, my understanding of our most serious societal issues, and my knowledge of approaches to worldly challenges.          My interest in medicine surpasses the compassionate service component; each exposure to medicine and its far-reaching applications leaves me with a hunger and a yearning to see and learn more. From assisting in MRIs to approaching pancreatic cancer solutions, my medically related experiences and science courses have intrigued and attracted me to medicine. The vast ability and increasing potential of medicine to have an impact on so many lives has focused my sights on solving physiological, mental, and emotional health problems.          Studying medicines social applications further enhances the feelings of compassion and love I have felt during my experiences with mothers and their babies as well as patients in pain. I can only imagine the joy felt by helping another mother just as Dr. Selby helped mine. Medicines power is immeasurable, and enriching lives is not only a responsibility but also the reward for all physicians. A vocation as a physician is my opportunity to best utilize my gifts and talents in order to improve the lives of others. Radiology and ER Volunteer at St. Elizabeth Health At St. Elizabeth Health, I volunteered in the ER and Radiology department, transporting patients and assisting in x-rays and CT scans. I actively worked with the nurses and doctors as patients entered into the emergency room, transporting them to the rooms with machines necessary to diagnose their chief complaint. I witnessed the importance of delicacy and care as well as swiftness when handling medicine in pressing situations, such as when a man enters the department with a nail through his knee. I learned the importance of contact between both the emergency room and other areas of the hospital and how their communication is essential for good medical care., St. Joseph Hospital Family Medicine Center At St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, my role as clinic assistant involved rooming patients, taking their vitals, and then reporting to both the nurse and doctor about the patient’s reason for visit. Interacting firsthand with the patients gave me the opportunity to listen, to understand their concerns, and to communicate this information with the doctors. I participated in the teamwork necessary for effective and efficient patient-physician relations, and the heightened level of awareness for this relationship will undoubtedly prepare me to carry out similar relations in the future., Unite for Sight Global Impact Fellow Currently, I am volunteering as a Global Impact Fellow with Unite for Sight in Ghana. I am working with ophthalmologists and other health professionals to fight blindness in one of the most affected countries. In this program, we go on outreaches to villages and other communities to screen patients and identify those in need of glasses, medication, and sometimes surgery. Performing hundreds of eye acuity tests with patients who do not speak English has tested my patience and compassion and forced me to develop skills that will aid me in my future relations with patients. Witnessing eye surgeries and asking questions have also intrigued me to ophthalmology., Pancreatic Cancer Research During the second semester of my junior year, I began researching at the Harper Cancer Research Institute in South Bend, Indiana under the guidance of Dr. Awasthi. The research focuses on pancreatic cancer, one of the most deadly and mysterious types of cancer, and the combination of drugs and therapy to diminish the disease’s harmful effects. Since becoming involved in the lab, I have learned many techniques and skills, such as growing cell cultures, making protein lysate and western blotting, to work with the cancer cells and drugs, and I will divulge more fully into the research during the upcoming semester., Life Guard and Family Video During the summer after my freshman year, I worked two jobs to earn money to pay for school costs. I worked as a fourth-year returning lifeguard during the day and as an employee at Family Video at night. My weekly hours ranged from sixty to seventy hours per week. The amount of work for these two jobs was demanding, but I was proud of my efforts to push the envelope of my work ethic. It was challenging, but I practiced discipline and determination to survive the long days. I know this work ethic will help me in medical school and especially for the long hours during residency., Shadowing Dr. Stransky During the summer after my sophomore year, I spent three full days shadowing Dr. Stransky at Tri-State Ophthalmology Consultants in Evansville, Indiana. I followed Dr. Stransky as he met with his patients and inquired about the various instruments he used to diagnose the eyes of his patients. I increased my understanding of the retina as well as the other areas of the eye, and this inspired me to continue my work this summer with Unite for Sight. During this experience, I practiced listening and observation skills, acknowledging that some of the best medical training I will receive is through more experienced physicians., Regis High School REACH Program During the summer before my junior year, I volunteered with Regis High School’s REACH Program in a summer service learning program. I taught and mentored underprivileged middle school students in order to prepare them for challenging high school entrance exams.  These students, predominantly from immigrant families, lacked access to the nice private schools and thus were disadvantaged to gain admittance into good high schools and, ultimately, college. Mentoring the students was rewarding as I helped them use their gifts and skills to utilize their outstanding ambition. Realizing and appreciating their struggles enhanced my social awareness and understanding of socioeconomic challenges., Rowing I maintained a high level of fitness to make it onto the Notre Dame Rowing Club after a two week tryout and then subjected myself to anywhere from six to eight practices per week. During these semesters, I developed better time management and organizational skills, finding a balance between work and play. Rowing with seven others in a boat requires crucial teamwork; without it, the boat will not move. Dedicating long hours with my fellow rowers not only gave me a heightened level of determination and persistence but also an understanding of teamwork, an appreciation for individuals’ unique skills and a better sense of responsibility for others., Environmental Science Research I participated in environmental science research for one semester under a graduate student studying the effects of factors such as deforestation and rainfall on growth of various species of trees. To study these effects, we collected trees in several areas of the Midwest, noting the histories of the areas. We then counted and measured the tree rings with an emphasis on years with more growth. Evolution was frequently a topic of discussion in this research, and it gave me a better appreciation for evolution’s applications, which will surely benefit me as I learn more about evolution’s role in human anatomy and development., Intramural Sports, Disc Golf, and Running I practice a balance between work and play by actively participating in intramural sports, hobbies, and exercise. I played intramural basketball and softball at Wabash College, and I played intramural basketball and full padded football at Notre Dame.  These sports gave me a great opportunity to release from academic stress and enjoy a fun event with my peers. I also enjoy a hobby of disc golf, which I have been playing since the age of nine. An outdoor sport, disc golf has been a chance for me to enjoy the great outdoors when my books are closed. Running is another one of my passions, and I will be running the Chicago Marathon in October of this year., Appalachia Service Seminar I spent two mid-semester breaks repairing and developing homes and neighborhoods in flood stricken areas of the Appalachia Mountains. During both of these seminars, I served as site leader for seventeen other students and guided our nightly reflections and travel to this region in Buchanan, Virginia. I not only learned much about leadership during this role but also developed a heightened sense of social awareness. Seeing such poverty forced me to ask tough questions, and I contemplated my role in society and ways to improve unfortunate situations such as the ones I saw., Healthwin I volunteered at a local elderly home named Healthwin, where I primarily worked with the patients experiencing dementia. This was my first exposure to this area of healthcare, and I appreciated seeing the work of the doctors and nurses who ensure not only good health but also a sustainable lifestyle away from home. Playing stimulating games with these patients tested my patients and simultaneously increased my level of compassion. To interact with someone whose mind is deteriorating requires a sincerely sympathetic attitude and an understanding of what the person is experiencing., Eagle Scout I was an active member of the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. To achieve the rank of Eagle, I designed, presented, and completed a service project for my community. My project consisted of a service for children to be fingerprinted and photographed. In conjunction with the police department in my hometown, the parents were given a form containing all ten fingerprints, picture, and other contact information in the event that their children were lost or missing. In all of my scouting experiences and most especially during my final Eagle Scout project, I developed leadership skills and learned how to be a productive, well informed citizen., Junior Class Council I was chosen to serve on Junior Class Council, a club on campus meant to unify our class. I worked with my peers to make decisions regarding how to blend and unite our fellow students. We then organized the projects, which ranged from a concert at a local theatre to singing Christmas carols at an elderly home. I enjoyed practicing my teamwork skills in this club, and I appreciated meeting new people that I may not have met otherwise. Serving in this club forced me to plan ways to unite our class and in doing so I learned about ways to bring people together, finding similarities despite our many differences.,  Student Assistant-ACE, Phi Gamma Delta Though I acknowledge the common negative stigma with fraternities, I am proud of my decision to rush, pledge, and become initiated as a brother of Phi Gamma Delta. The teamwork skills and genuine humility gained during pledgeship readily steer me to this day, and the skills needed to balance my pledge responsibilities with academics will continue to help me during the many responsibilities of medical school. The brotherhood formed in a fraternity is very similar to environments that I will face in medical school, residency, and in practice as I am forced to work with those who are very different from me though we carry the same goals."

    "text": "For the majority of my life, my plan was to become an elementary school teacher because I have a passion for learning and sharing that love with others. If you had told a younger version of myself that I would now be working on medical school applications, or that I would be in the midst of an internship where I converse fluently with Spanish patients, or that in the fall I would be enrolled in a human cadaver dissection lab, I probably would not have believed you. When I was younger, I liked order and familiarity, so when I decided at age five that I would be a teacher, I stuck with it. I have always been curious, but getting me out of my comfort zone used to take some coaxing. Fortunately, I grew up with a strong support system and constantly had my parents and teachers encouraging me to explore my interests and what the world has to offer.  Moving away to college in a new city was my first big step outside of my comfort zone that allowed me to see the vast possibilities of directions my life could take. After meticulously researching and visiting around 40 college campuses, I decided to attend Xavier University for the broad liberal arts education and the community of inspired and involved students and faculty, hoping I would uncover and spark a passion of my own. I took Biology and Chemistry as a freshman because I had always enjoyed science and wanted to explore these subjects at a higher level. I found myself fascinated during every class, so I declared as a biology major and started exploring a career in the medical field.   I love science because I love understanding why things happen, and this causes me to ask a lot of questions. My professors at Xavier frequently take time outside of the classroom to indulge my curiosity and answer my questions that are deemed to be outside the scope of the class. The summer after studying abroad, I took the second half of physics and organic chemistry at a community college back home to catch up with my program. Although I earned an A in both classes, I retook physics at Xavier because I felt there was still so much more I could learn about the subject. I thoroughly enjoyed the class the second time around and will be teaching the review sessions for it next year. I am constantly amazed by things I learn, to the point I have to call home and tell my parents about them, but yet I know my education is just beginning.  I started exposing myself to the medical field in small ways. The summer after freshman year I volunteered at University of Michigan Mott Childrens hospital in the child life department and Ill never forget sitting in awe in an almost silent room holding a tiny baby on a ventilator while the busy hospital hummed around me. This was my first exposure to a hospital environment and I was hooked. During my weekly shifts here, I enjoyed watching the patient/doctor relationships form and grow.  The following spring, I had the opportunity to build my own relationships similar to those I witnessed. For four months I lived in Managua, Nicaragua and worked in a physical rehabilitation hospital. As the only public physical rehabilitation hospital in a poor country, they were understaffed and underfunded and I provided support wherever they needed it. I was able to slowly build relationships with amputees as we laughed together at my first awful attempts at Spanish. As my relationships and language skills developed I was both overjoyed, taking first steps with amputees who thought theyd never walk again, and heartbroken, hearing stories of people whose family members had to wait too long for simple treatment because they couldnt pay. I watched doctors and nurses struggle to meet patients' needs with the limited money and resources they had and was consistently amazed as they found innovative solutions to the obstacles they came across. I experienced the other side of the system when I myself fell sick, and was rushed through the waiting process in a private hospital because I was an American and I could pay.   During my time in Nicaragua, I became uncomfortable with the way the world is around me. I saw inequality both inside and outside of the hospital, and this made me want to learn more about the challenges in the health system in my own country, and what I could do to help resolve these issues. This is why I sought out my internship at Crossroads Health Center.  One of the biggest changes Ive seen in myself in the past three years is that Ive learned to seek out and embrace new experiences, and the effects they have on me. These experiences have reaffirmed my desire to pursue a career in medicine and simultaneously required me to rethink what my role is to better the world. Because of the classes I have taken, the people I have met, and the opportunities I have had, I am excited and confident about my decision to become a physician. I believe that in this choice, I have not only found a way to pursue life long learning in an area that is fascinating to me, but that I have found a way to use this knowledge and my strengths and skills to directly better peoples lives and to pursue a passion for bridging the inequalities in the health care system all while being able to collaborate and work with other passionate, dedicated individuals.  Barista, Coffee Emporium Barista Coffee Emporium is a local Cincinnati coffee shop with 6 locations, 2 of which are at Xavier University. I work 16 hours a week during the school year at the Xavier locations and 40 hours a week during the summer at the other locations. I quickly moved through my training in one month, allowing me to progress from cashier to barista. My tasks on shift include making drinks, keeping a clean store, greeting and conversing with customers. I am frequently held responsible for opening and closing the store, including closing the cash register and making bank deposits. I am also trusted by my managers to represent Coffee Emporium at catering events such as weddings or farmers' markets., Crossroads Health Center Volunteer Internship Program Crossroads is a low income primary care health clinic in Over The Rhine, Cincinnati. As a Crossroads intern I have one 4 hour shift a week in the clinic and attend meetings about once a month with the other interns. During the clinical shifts I have the opportunity to shadow a physician that I am paired with or her medical assistants for about an hour. For the remainder of my shift I call patients to follow up and see if they made appointments with the specialists they were referred to by their primary care provider or help them do so. For the summer, I am handling all of the Spanish referral calls. I also clean exam rooms and help with various other tasks around the clinic., University of Michigan Health System Volunteer During the summers following my freshman and sophomore college years I returned home to Ann Arbor and volunteered weekly with the University of Michigan Health Systems. I went through a selective application process and training session. My first summer I worked in the Child Life department. My tasks here included playing with children, taking infants on walks around the hospital floor and cleaning the play room. My second summer I worked in a Medsport Physical Therapy clinic. Here I had the opportunity to help a physical therapy aide with tasks to keep the clinic running smoothly, as well as shadow physicians and physical therapists on occasion., Orientation Activities at Xavier University -Getaway Leader: I have been a small group leader on this weekend Freshmen retreat for the past two years and work with other leaders to plan the retreat. (Tim Dunn). - Interlink Mentor: Last year upon returning from my study abroad experience, I served as a resource for international students to help them adjust to life at Xavier. (Anja Abney, International Student Advisor, abneya@xavier.edu) - Manresa: I am currently training to be an orientation leader for incoming freshmen this August. I was selected from a large, competitive applicant pool. I will co-lead a small group through the four day orientation. (Molly Dugan, Assistant Director of Student Involvement, duganm@xavier.edu), Pioneer High School Band Camp Head Counselor I am the head counselor at my high school's band camp, managing 30 staff members and overseeing 200 students. The camp takes place at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Interlochen, MI for one week in late August. In the months leading up to the camp I am responsible for hiring the staff and working with the band director to prepare the camp program. In 2012 as a counselor my duties included being responsible for the 12 students in my cabin, leading French Horn sectionals and teaching during marching drills. In June 2013, the prior Head Counselor left the position for another job and the band director selected me to take over, rehiring me for the 2014 summer after a successful 2013 camp., French Horn I began playing the french horn in 5th grade. I took weekly lessons with Tammy Kosinski from 2006-2011, when I graduated high school. I performed in her studio recitals twice a year, both as a soloist and in various ensembles. In high school I performed in band for four years and participated in marching band for three years (David Leach, leachd@aaps.k12.mi.us). As a band we participated in various competitions, traveling to New York City and Beijing, China. At Xavier University, I participate in the Symphonic Winds Ensemble. We rehearse three times a week, play three or four concerts a semester and just returned from a tour in Europe (May 2014) (Dr. Matthew Westgate, westgatem@xavier.edu).,  Study group leader, Study Abroad - Aldo Chavarria The spring semester of my sophomore year I spent 4 months in Managua, Nicaragua through a Xavier University study abroad program with a focus on service learning. I went with five fellow students and a professor. We each lived with different families in the same neighborhood, took classes together and traveled together on the weekends. I volunteered for 12 hours a week at Aldo Chavarria, which is the only physical rehabilitation hospital in Nicaragua. At the hospital I assisted the therapists with daily tasks and spent time conversing with patients who had no familial support. No one in my host family or in the hospital spoke English, so I relied on Spanish to communicate in most situations., Volunteer Xavier University Tour Guide Through a Xavier University campus club I give tours to prospective freshmen and their families. As a freshman I completed training to become certified and each semester I attend a refresher training session. Most of my tours are given on Admitted Student Days where I will give four or five hour long tours in a row. I enjoy sharing what I love about Xavier with prospective freshmen as they make college decisions."

    "text": "I have begun to develop a passion for medical service due to a few amazing people, and eye-opening experiences. After shadowing doctors ranging from city surgeons to family physicians in my hometown, Georgetown, Ohio, of less than 10,000 people, I have come to realize that pursuing a career in medicine is the best path for me.  \tDuring my breaks from school I usually did full time factory maintenance work at Milacron Plastics Technologies and was a manager at Lake Waynoka Pool. I had two jobs in order to help pay for my education at Centre College. Although my weeks typically involved 70+ hours of work, I also made time for shadowing local physicians and training for cross-country and track. I ran both cross-country and track for Centre, and training involved running up to 70 miles a week. Although my summers were difficult, I was able to perfect my time management skills. The stark contrast between working on the factory floor and in the hospital also highlighted for me my desire to work in a medical setting.   One of my favorite physicians to shadow was a family doctor who has been my neighbor for the last 18 years. Watching Dr. Ache care for the people of our hometown for the 15 hours I shadowed him was an absolute joy. He was able to heal not only with the medical care he provided, but also by the kind words and support he offered. It was evident after watching the visits with only a few patients that Dr. Ache was their biggest supporter. I heard a member of the University of Louisville Medical school admissions committee mention the art of medicine. At first I didnt understand what this meant, but after watching Dr. Ache, I knew. The art was in showing honest compassion for each patient and giving every patient the time they deserved. In my own career it is my hope that I am able to emulate this exemplary display of care. \tVolunteering in the ER at Ephraim McDowell Hospital in Danville Kentucky has also inspired me to become a physician.  While in the ER, I was not able to offer much hands-on patient care, but I was able to talk to the patients. The interactions I had with these patients were unforgettable. One case that stood out to me was a man who had severely cut his hand while trying to open a can of soup with a knife.  At first I was merely helping the nurse prepare his hand for stitches, when I noticed that he was extremely uncomfortable. When I asked if he was ok, his response was that he was very afraid of injections. This was a problem because he was about to experience a barrage of needles to help disinfect and clean his wound. While I couldnt be the hand that sewed the wound, what I did do was simply talk to the man. Our conversation was at first a little forced, he was preoccupied with the impending needles, but soon we were chatting at length about his family and my college life. Before we knew it, the stitches were finished and he was ready to go. He was extremely grateful, and the feeling I got when I was able to ease his discomfort was almost overwhelming. I knew I was in the right place.  \tThis past January I was fortunate enough to do an internship with an anesthesiologist named Dr. Anjum Bux. Working with Dr. Bux over the course of a month showed me what it was really like to live the day to day life of a doctor, and gave me insight into a side of medicine that I had never experienced. Over the course of a month, I saw many surgeries and procedures. This internship exposed me to the exact science and art that is anesthesiology, and also constantly impressed me with the wonders of medicine. One of the most inspiring procedures that I encountered was the neurotransmitter that we inserted into the spines of pain patients. This device intercepts the pain signals sent from the patients pain source and replaces them with only a slight tingle. Another time that I was amazed was when I witnessed my first birth. I could not believe that one moment there were five of us in the room, and then the next there were six. By coming to work with Dr. Bux every day, I witnessed aspects of a physicians life that I was not previously able to discern doing more short-term work. There were days when Dr. Bux was tired from balancing his growing young family, and his unpredictable work schedule. But even the morning after being called in to deliver a baby at 2 am, I could still see the excitement and the joy that his career continued to give him.  \tThese people and experiences have greatly inspired me on my journey towards becoming a physician. Shadowing Dr. Ache exposed me to an example of extraordinary care. Volunteering in the ER at Ephraim McDowell allowed me to experience the joy of providing patient care first-hand. Lastly, interning with Dr. Anjum Bux opened my eyes to the challenges and the even greater rewards that come with being a physician. Although each of these experiences were very different, they have all confirmed my desire to become a physician. Lifeguard at Boles Natatorium As a lifeguard I am responsible for maintaining the safety of swimmers and a safe pool environment., Lifeguard/ Supervisor at Lake Waynoka Pool As a lifeguard, my responsibilities included maintaining the safety of the swimmers, providing a safe environment, and cleaning the pool area. As a supervisor I was in charge of assigning lifeguard duties, testing the pool water quality, and keeping patrons safe., Security Guard at the Norton Center for the Arts As a security guard my job was to assist both the patrons and performers by maintaining a safe environment. My job duties included helping patrons find their seats, guarding backstage entrances, and escorting performers., Vice President of Risk Management As the Vice President of Risk Management, I am responsible for maintaining a safe environment by enforcing our national risk management policy at all fraternity sponsored events. I am also responsible for maintaining a dialogue with both campus security and the student life office regarding the risk management of our chapter. Lastly I encourage safe practices by organizing several risk management workshops in which I bring in local members of the Danville community to give educational talks.  For example, the chief of the fire department visited and talked about fire safety.,  Construction, Shadowing of Dr. Andy Ache I shadowed Dr. Ache during patient appointments at his office in Georgetown, Ohio., Anesthesiology Internship I shadowed Dr. Anjum Bux during many surgeries and pain management procedures. This involved being at the hospital every day at 7 am and leaving whenever Dr. Bux was done for the day. In addition to the shadowing, I also read multiple medical books, wrote a report on my internship, and delivered a presentation to Centre professors about my internship., Volunteer at Ephraim McDowell Regional Medical Center I volunteered at Ephraim McDowell Regional Medical Center for two days a week in the fall of 2013. I worked in the ER, and my duties included stocking carts and rooms, filing papers, offering blankets to patients, cleaning rooms, and shadowing. I also worked in the ICU, and there my duties included stocking rooms and cabinets, running errands, and shadowing., Volunteer at Ronald McDonald House I volunteered at the Ronald McDonald House serving food to families who had children staying at Cincinnati Children's Hospital., Centre College Cross Country I was a member of the Centre College Cross Country team in the fall of my freshman and sophomore years. I qualified for the conference team both years, and my freshman year our team qualified for nationals and had the highest academic average of any division three cross country team., Centre College Track and Field I was a member of the Centre College Track and Field team my freshman and sophomore year. I participated in the 5000 meter, 1500 meter, and the steeplechase. I also qualified for the conference team both years., Member of DECA Community Service Team I was a member of the Georgetown DECA's Community Service team. Two other students and I organized several fundraisers including Powderpuff Football, and a Junior High dance, to raise money for a local charity called the Coach's Cancer Fund. We were able to raise about 2,000 dollars. We then presented our project at the Ohio DECA conference. We placed second and qualified to present our presentation in Orlando, Florida., Maintenance Worker at Milacron Plastics Technologies I worked full time at Milacron in maintenance. My responsibilities included building maintenance, janitorial work, and assisting assembly workers., Volunteer At Brown County General Hospital My senior year of high school, I volunteered every day after school at the Brown County General Hospital in the Cardiopulmonary Department. My duties included filing papers, running errands, and shadowing., Volunteer at Georgetown Church of Christ Food Drive My youth group and I would first pass out bags to each house in Georgetown asking for donations of canned foods. We would then collect these bags a week later and use the food to stock our food pantry at the Georgetown Church of Christ. I participated in the food drive for 3 years."

    "text": "If I am asked what I hope to do with my life, be a doctor is the response I give only if I need a very short answer. Although being a doctor is firmly a part of my goals, it is not a goal in itself, but rather a step to achieve my real goal: to work in maternal healthcare and be a part of the solution to reduce the disparities in maternal healthcare outcomes that persist in our country. If I were elaborating more on life ambitions, I might describe my hope of starting a community-level women's health center in Camden, New Jersey, increasing the amount of quality healthcare available in a city with a maternal mortality rate that is double the national average.   It is easy for me to pinpoint my first moment of interest in maternal healthcare.  During my sophomore year of college, my mother gave me a copy of Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's Half the Sky, and the chapters on maternal mortality and morbidity left me stunned. I had known that giving birth could be dangerous, but I suppose that I had assumed that the risk had gone the same way as the risk of contracting smallpox. The realization that mothers and infants still routinely die or are seriously injured during birth shook off my unconscious complacence.  I was particularly appalled by the revelation that maternal and infant mortality is a disproportionately large issue not just in developing healthcare settings, but here, in the healthcare system that had always done a great job taking care of me. How was it that so many women died during an event I had been used to thinking of as traumatic but not life-threatening   Those few dozen pages pointed me toward a cause that continues to inspire me. The individual stories and overall statistics are often heartbreaking, unfathomable, and angering, yet they are also motivating: this is an area where progress can be made, and is being made, and I am determined to contribute to that progress.   During college, I had the chance to take several public health classes, which provided a framework in which to analyze the problems facing womens healthcare. I also got my first experience interacting with patients when I went to Ecuador with a medical brigade, where we shadowed doctors and took vital signs. Since graduating, I have worked to get more practical experience.  I volunteered for several weeks with a women's health, advocacy and development organization in Costa Rica. Although the group did not specifically deal with maternal healthcare, it was inspiring and informative to see the way the organization combined political advocacy; access to healthcare, social work, and legal resources; and informal community support.  More recently, I have started to get involved hands-on in contributing to the work of improving maternal health outcomes in this country, by volunteering as a doula. I attended training to become a certified doula, and I will use these skills before I start medical school to get experience supporting women through childbirth.  My intentions to pursue medicine may have crystallized with the discovery of my passion about women's health, but my life experiences have been nudging me toward a role as a caretaker for far longer. Growing up as the steady-handed, unfazed-by-blood, and enthusiastic sister to four accident-prone brothers, I have been an impromptu medic for as long as I can remember. Whether it was removing splinters and bandaging minor injuries after a misadventure, helping a college roommate cope with a chronic illness, or sharing tips on re-learning to walk after knee surgery with an athlete on the field hockey team I coached, caring for those around me has always been a role I enjoy. I have naturally fallen into the role of caretaker for my mother during the ups and downs that have occurred in my family in the last several years. While I have learned much about the emotional toll that caregiving can take and how thankless it can feel at times, I have also come to appreciate the satisfaction of watching the slow, halting improvements that mark recovery.  Looking back at the steps that led me to medicine, there are several other possibilities that I have considered as career paths, especially biology research and computer programming. I have invested a large amount of time in both of these pursuits, and while I enjoy them immensely, I have trouble envisioning these interests as life careers. I have come out of presentations about designing graphic user interfaces or studying signaling pathways in crustaceans more informed, but I have frequently come out of presentations about medicine inspired, feeling like I completely understand how people can give up so much to pour themselves into a career. There was no moment when I knew I wanted to be a doctor, but I know now that becoming a doctor is a necessary step to achieve that kind of career for myself. Webmaster; Director of Recruitment Records; Member As a general member of Delta Gamma, I enjoyed being part of a group of women who had diverse concentrations, activities, and interests.  In addition to the social aspect of the sorority, we volunteered at Perkins School for the Blind, which was a valuable lesson in accommodating and aiding people who are visually impaired. My most valuable experience with Delta Gamma, however, was as an officer. This was my first officer position in college, and it gave me the chance to observe how a well-run organization functions from the inside. The pointers and ideas I picked up as a DG officer, especially those relating to navigating diverging views, were invaluable in other leadership positions., Field Hockey Goalkeeper As a goalkeeper on the team, I had to learn to project confidence even in a new environment with older players that I knew were much more experienced and skilled than I was. Off the field, the sport was a way to keep my life balanced and structured during those first few months of college when freshmen are trying to adjust to a new academic format. I had to learn to do work efficiently around the large blocks of time for practices and games. Although a slow-healing knee injury made me decide to leave field hockey for non-athletic activities, the experiences I had during my year on the team played an enormous role in shaping my college career and development., Teaching Fellow As a Teaching Fellow for large course, I taught section meetings, graded problem sets, worked at office hours, and helped grade exams. In addition to helping me gain a deeper understanding of the course’s material, I greatly enjoyed the one-on-one interactions with students. Watching someone develop their understanding of the material was incredibly rewarding, as was watching their code improve throughout the semester., Goalkeeper Coach As the volunteer goalkeeper coach for the high school team, I attended team practices and games, working primarily with the team’s goalkeepers and coordinating defensive strategy. In addition to working with the players on the field, I counseled several team seniors on college applications and helped support players through difficult personal situations., VP Communications As the VP Communications for a fledgling alumni organization, I have been heavily involved in building the organizational infrastructure of HUMA. I built most of the organization's website, including writing a substantial amount of code for a member database. I have also been responsible for organizing the membership records and growing the membership, including finding past alumni from across the Harvard schools. Since I began the research for this project, we have nearly doubled our membership, from about 300 to over 500., Administrative Assistant and Bookkeeper I assisted substantially with the startup of the new law firm, including researching the Philadelphia commercial real estate market, finding a realtor to work with, participating in the architectural design of the new space, reviewing the initial drafts of the lease, and assisting with the website design and furniture purchase for the firm. Now that the firm is established, I manage the law office’s filing, billing and record-keeping and assist with diverse technological issues. Additionally, I identified ways to streamline the firm's bookkeeping system, and based on that analysis I migrated the firm’s records to new software., Volunteer I volunteered for three weeks in San Ramón, Costa Rica with this organization, which fights domestic violence culture, provides psychological counseling and safe spaces for women to connect, and supports health awareness. As a volunteer, I compiled and analyzed psychologist visit data for 2013, participated in running several group discussions, including shadowing at a support group session for survivors of domestic violence, and helped in executing planned activities for the International Day Commemorating Violence Against Women., President My first officer position with the Harvard Islamic Society was as Islam Awareness Week Chair, in the spring of 2011. This position involved coordinating logistics and advertising for five events over the course of four weeks, as part of the group's annual series showcasing aspects of Islamic faith and culture on campus. My second position with the Islamic Society was as President, during the 2012 calendar year. As president of an active religious community on campus, I was involved in community organizing, community service, event coordination, meeting management, and fundraising; our annual budget exceeded $15,000, and we hosted multiple events with over a hundred attendees., First Author Nast, A. R., Extavour, C. G. Ablation of a Single Cell From Eight-cell Embryos of the Amphipod Crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis. J. Vis. Exp., 2014.  This video protocol demonstrates the single-cell ablation procedure that formed the backbone of my college laboratory research. The publication served as a final project when an illness prevented me from writing a senior thesis. After several years of listening to lab group discussions about the publishing process, the JoVE protocol gave me firsthand experience publishing a peer-reviewed manuscript. I also gained some technical expertise, as I scripted, edited and formatted the entire video, and made the procedure animation used in the video., Various high school awards National Science Fair Awards - Intel Science Talent Search National Finalist (1 of 40) - National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium (JSHS), Second Place, Environmental and Earth Science, $6000 Scholarship, April 2006  - American Museum of Natural History Young Naturalist Essay Contest, One of two first-place prizes chosen for grade: 2006, 2007, 2008  Academics and Activities - Presidential Scholar, Female recipient from Pennsylvania, 2008 - Valedictorian - National Honor Society, President, 2007-2008 Academic Year - AP Scholar with Distinction - Nestlé Very Best in Youth Award, 2007 (1 of 27 students in the USA, grades 7 – 12) - National Merit Scholar, 2008, Medical brigade volunteer Our group spent five days assisting Ecuadorian doctors with free medical clinics in rural schools and villages. As one of volunteers more proficient in Spanish, I spent a large amount of time working at the vital signs station. This was my first experience working with non-family individuals in any kind of caretaker-patient interaction. One thing that struck me was how much energy it takes to invest as much personality in the last few patients of the day as in the first few, and how important that personality is in making the patient at ease. In addition to providing extra hands, we had rotating opportunities to shadow the doctors, in my case the gynecologist and the dentist., SAT and College Application Coach The Let's Get Ready! program provides low-income and first-generation college-bound students with SAT tutoring and college application advice. Coaches spend the semester working with small groups on math or verbal, help students write personal statements and fill out applications, and answer students' questions about college. This experience demonstrated to me how much situations out of the students' control impacted their progress. It also brought many rewarding moments, from watching my students' scores on grammar questions increase after teaching them to identify prepositions, to seeing their improvement between their final testing scores and their initial diagnostic results., Undergraduate research This research experience was my first time working in a formal lab setting, and it gave me a solid foundation on research protocol, grant applications and the research publication process. I was fortunate to join a small lab with a phenomenally supportive atmosphere, interesting research topics and enthusiastic researchers, and a P.I. who was invested in helping the undergrads have a productive and enriching experience. My research involved studying germ cell replacement after ablation in the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis. During the project, I learned techniques including in situ hybridization staining, antibody staining, molecular cloning, micro-dissection, and rt-PCR., Vision Screening Volunteer Unite for Sight is a national organization whose college chapters organize vision screenings at local shelters, soup kitchens and community centers, targeting the members of the population who are least likely to get regular vision care. The vision screenings are primarily designed to illustrate to people when they might need a rigorous eye examination, and to provide resources about means of paying for those services.  During my time with Unite for Sight, I helped run multiple vision testing sessions. Most surprising to me was how many people did not realize when their visual acuity was substantially below normal."

    "text": "We each live once.  To live life to its fullest capacity, I believe we must find a purpose that challenges and drives us to a level higher than we previously thought possible.  I choose to make my purpose in life the quest for knowledge, specifically, knowledge of the human body, its functions, its faults, and the science that can turn the latter into the former.  I see more mystery and complexity in the workings of one living body than in the fastest computer, the largest city, or the most tightly woven political pact.  I believe that the field of medicine is one that will never divulge all of its secrets.  I will never know all of the answers.  I will never reach the end of my quest, but perhaps along the way I can make a difference.  Perhaps I can improve the quality of life and relieve the suffering of my patients.   My time at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) convinced me that my path lay in medicine.  There, surrounded by world-class biologists, I saw the non-medical side of life science.  While I hold each of those professors in the highest regard for their dedication to both their disciplines and their students, I ended that summer remembering most a little boy with Cerebral Palsy named Jesse and his family.  They had welcomed me into their home as a caregiver and working with them made me realize that sometimes it is not the patient, but the patient's family who suffer the most.  Due to the severity of his condition Jesse is virtually unaware of his disadvantaged life, but his parents are not.  His mother's head is held high with pride, and her love is unconditional, but her eyes occasionally take on a far-off look when other eight-year-old boys in the neighborhood run by laughing and playing with one-another.  For all the brilliance and effort exerted by the researchers at UMBS, I know that none of their research will provide the answer prayed for by Jesse's family.  Those scientists will never enable Jesse to walk, speak, or care for himself, and they will never ease the burden on his parents' hearts.  It will be doctors of human medicine that are someday able to perform this feat, and I long to be one of them.  As a college freshman I dreamed of becoming a doctor and volunteering my services in Africa and South America, where the need is great and the resources low.  Six years ago my dream seemed too lofty to materialize, but since that time I have worked successfully to bring at least part of that dream into reality.  I write this statement from the Peruvian Amazon, where I am currently investigating Leptospirosis, an infectious disease that affects underprivileged populations worldwide.  With the support of colleagues, I am spending the summer interviewing and collecting blood samples from residents of a rural town with the hopes of gaining an understanding of what behaviors expose populations to this disease, and how best to aid them in future prevention.    The opportunity to pursue part of my dream at this point in my life was the dominant factor in my decision to pursue a Master's in Epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health before attending medical school.  The education I have received here thus far has proved invaluable to my understanding of both the needs and delivery of healthcare in the United States and abroad.  It has matured my outlook and further refined my specific goals for my future in medicine.  Here in Peru I have walked down dirt streets holding the hands of some of the poorest children in the world.  My original dream is stronger than ever, and I have never been as certain as I am now, that the field of direct medical care is where I belong.                Every day brings new opportunities.  The process of accepting and declining those opportunities shapes our lives and defines who we are. My choices have led me to apply to medical school, in pursuit of my truest desires.  I believe in the goodness of mankind, I believe in letting fate lend a helping hand, and I believe in myself.  Someday, I will be a doctor of human medicine.

    "text": "Drums and feet pounded in Lubwe, a town in rural Zambia.  It was the first annual HIV and AIDS Awareness day, and I was excited that so much of the community had come.  There were singing groups, dancers, skits from the local schools (some in English, most in Bemba), and a crowd of villagers and children gathered for entertainment and education.  This was the end of a service immersion trip in the summer of 2007, and my student group would soon be returning to the US.  I had spent the last month working with schools, a library project, and helping prepare this awareness day.  During the trip I also spent time in Lubwe Mission Hospital observing the realities of healthcare in the developing world.  I learned how to test for malaria, about the struggle to overcome myths about HIV, and how the hospital had to maneuver in the international funding network to survive.   I saw that improving health care was the single biggest way to improve quality of life.  On returning to the US, I had made up my mind that I wanted to pursue a career in medicine.   \tI have felt drawn to becoming a physician since high school.   However, a broad curiosity has made my decision to commit to medical school gradual.   From childhood, I've been playing piano, reading, and drawing.  I remain interested in the arts.  Curiosity and the desire to make the most of my education have led me to succeed in many subjects.  Most fascinating to me, though, is discovering more of how the world works through science.  This continuing desire to pursue knowledge both in and outside the classroom attracts me to the lifelong learning that is the responsibility of physicians.   \tSpecific activities as an undergraduate have reinforced my decision for medical school.  I was involved in research early on, working as an assistant first at Wright Patterson Air Force Base and later in the University Chemistry Department.  It has been exciting to progressively take on more research responsibility: collecting data, publishing a journal article with my advisor in 2007, and now taking on a project of my own.  I want to incorporate research into my continuing education, and I can see myself becoming involved in medical research after graduation.  I am inspired by the idea of applying medical school education and my chemistry background to a disease such as malaria.   However, I also realize that a career purely in research feels limiting.  I want to be able to help people more directly, and to have the challenge and variety of solving new problems daily.   \tMy activities with the service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega (APO) especially have led me to choose medicine over other science-related careers.  I am grateful to my parents for emphasizing service to others early in my life, and APO has helped me realize I want this value to remain central in my career.  APO also led me to broader experiences outside the university.  Each spring break we make a service trip to Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota.  It is a cooperative effort, involving members of our big tiospaye (Lakota for extended family) from Standing Rock, UD, and a half-dozen states.  Each time I return I learn more.  I have come to realize that the poverty on Standing Rock is closely tied with health issues.  Modern diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and mental health issues are rampant in communities like Little Eagle where there is minimal access to health care.  The possibility of being involved in development of better, cost-effective treatments and preventative care for these common maladies is very attractive to me.  I have also learned a little about traditional Lakota medicine, especially from Linda Different-Cloud Jones, a professor at Sitting Bull College.  The integration of herbal remedies and western medicine without compromising either traditional beliefs or rigorous standards is a fascinating challenge.  \tThis variety of interests--science, service, health care in impoverished areas--is what led me to take the trip to Zambia.  I had volunteered and shadowed physicians in hospitals before, but Lubwe Mission Hospital was a very different experience.  Malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, and a number of tropical parasites afflict the population.  I was inspired by seeing how many people a free clinic can help, but these clinics are far spread and often operating with a minimum or resources.  I was frustrated by being able to observe but not having the resources or the training to help beyond a few basic tasks.  Living and cooperating with the people of Lubwe I also learned how much poor health care challenges individuals and the community as a whole.  Malaria and HIV are real barriers to everything from getting an education and planning a stable family to completing drinking wells and modern infrastructure. Although the diseases are different in Lubwe, the themes felt familiar from experiences in Standing Rock:  inadequate access to health care, distrust between modern medicine and traditional remedies, need for medication that is effective and affordable, and need for information that is both accessible and accurate.  These are challenges that a medical education will equip me to tackle, and this is why I want to be a physician. Alpha Epsilon Delta Alpha Epsilon Delta is a national pre-health fraternity.  I pledged fall of 2007, and was inducted January 2008.   With this group I have taken advantage of opportunities for service projects, talking with visiting physicians, and hearing presentations on modern health care issues., Alpha Phi Omega Alpha Phi Omega is an international co-ed service fraternity.  It is founded on the principles of leadership, friendship, and service, and is affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America.  I pledged APO freshman year, and have been an active member since.  I have participated in a variety of service projects, such as neighborhood cleanup, fund raising for charity, and helping at a science fair.  My chapter of APO requires 15 hours of service each semester, and I have exceeded this each semester often with more than 30 hours.  Alpha Phi Omega also introduced me to a service commitment with Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota, which I have described as a separate activity.  I have increasingly taken leadership roles in Alpha Phi Omega.  Sophomore year, as the Helping Other People Event Chair, I organized a dodgeball tournament which collected canned goods for a local homeless shelter.  Junior year I was appointed as Breakout Chair, and led the spring break service immersion to Standing Rock.  For my final year, I have been elected as Fundraising Chair.  I look forward to staying active in my senior year and keeping the friends I have made after graduation., Wright Patterson Air Force Base Research Assistant As a junior in high school I applied to the Wright Scholar Research Assistant Program.  I was hired in the Air Vehicles Directorate of Wright Patterson.  and in the summers of 2004 and 2005 I worked for Chet Brewster.  This was primarily office work, but I also learned the basics of LabVIEW and AutoCAD software and attended educational seminars as part of the Wright Scholars Program.  For the summer of 2006 I searched for a job more related to my chemistry major and switched to employment in the Propulsion Directorate under Thomas Reitz.  Responsibilities included reorganizing lab equipment, helping to set up a new fuel cell for testing, and using Gaussian 03 molecular modeling software., Standing Rock Breakout Trips During freshman year I participated in the annual nine day spring break service trip from the University of Dayton to Standing Rock Reservation, South Dakota.  The student component was led by Alpha Phi Omega, and the trip was organized primarily by Dr. Mary Anne Angel and the APO spring breakout chair, Mel Lyle.  In the town of Little Eagle I was moved by the poverty I saw and also inspired by some truly great individuals.  I have returned to Little Eagle twice more on the spring break trip, leading the 2008 trip.  Service has included activities with children, providing community meals, and construction work on a new community center.  I also wrote for a grant, enabling myself and two others to return May 2008 and work on setting up gardens.  For me, this connection has grown beyond service projects.  Tiospaye is the Lakota word for extended family, and I think that is appropriate for the collection of students, UD faculty, and many others who are committed to Little Eagle.  I feel I have learned tremendously from this community, and I know I will remain connected years to come., Publication in Journal of Molecular Structure Full title of article:  C-N Bond Rotation and E-Z Isomerism in Some N-benzyl-N-methylcarbamoyl  Chlorides:  A DFT Study.  This project was a computational chemistry investigation using Gaussian 03 software, which calculates theoretical properties of a molecule using the electronic wavefunctions.  A series of carbamoyl chlorides with varying substituents were analyzed for most stable isomer and energy barriers for bond rotation.  This class of compounds has rarely been investigated before, and may be useful in developing new cancer treatment drugs.  Dr. Benin designed the project and wrote the majority of the paper.  I obtained and organized the majority of the data for the paper while working for Dr. Benin during my sophomore year.  I also gave a poster presentation of this research during the University of Dayton Stander Symposium in April 2007., Chemistry Department Reseach I started research with Dr. Benin sophomore year as a volunteer, working about two hours a week.  After returning from Zambia in the summer of 2007 I was hired  for the rest of the summer, working about 30 hours a week.  I continued research throughout  my junior year on a more limited basis.  I am hired again for about 30 hours a week in the summer of 2008.  My first research project with Dr. Benin, an investigation of carbamoyl chlorides, resulted in a publication in the Journal of Molecular Structure (described separately).  While completing this project in 2007 I also started my current project, an investigation of a potential antibiotic from the tropical tree Moringa oleifera.  I became interested in this tree during my immersion trip to Zambia, where it was being grown for a nutritional supplement for Lubwe Mission Hospital.  After examining  existing literature, I decided on one compound, pterygospermin that I was interested in investigating.  With Dr. Benin's help, I designed a two-part research aprroach:  theoretical investigation using Gaussian 03 software, and extractions from tree roots followed by NMR analysis.  This research project will be presented as my Honors Thesis and my Chemistry Department Thesis., Chemistry Lab Teacher I taught one section of Chemistry 123 Lab, normally the first lab taken by science and engineering majors.  Responsibilities included explaining procedures, overseeing experiments including student safety, grading assignments, and determining the final grade.  In general, labs lasted three hours, with an additional hour-long TA preparation meeting and about three hours spent grading each week., Zambia Summer Immersion In the summer of 2007, I spent about six weeks in Zambia, mostly in the rural town of Lubwe.  This trip was sponsored by UD's Center for Social Concern, and was organized by the participants (eight students and one staff member).    We stayed at the guest house of the local Sisters of Mercy, and focused on specific projects that had been suggested by the community.  This included organizing a library, visiting schools with donations of supplies, and helping with the first annual HIV/AIDS awareness day.  I was able to spend about five hours a week at Lubwe Mission Hospital observing or volunteering in the wards.  I also spent time in the hospital pharmacy and laboratory.  Seeing the treatment of malaria, HIV, and a variety of tropical diseases in the developing world was an eye-opening experience, and has added to my view of medicine as service.  This trip also involved time commitment beforehand, as we attended an immersion class and raised donations, and afterwards as we continued to meet to prepare for the next student group., Carl I. Michaelis Scholarship Michaelis Scholarships are  awarded annually to qualifying junior and senior chemistry and biochemistry majors on a competitive basis., Miami Valley Hospital Volunteer Most of sophomore year I volunteered one day a week in the Miami Valley Hospital Outpatient Clinic.  My primary responsibility was patient transport to other parts of the hospital., Piano Piano has been important to me since beginning lessons in third grade.   I have continued to the present, taking my keyboard to UD and making room in my schedule for lessons.  I occasionally perform, but piano for me is primarily a way to relax and enjoy music., American Chemical Society The American Chemical Society Student Affiliate Group is a pre-professional organization that consists of undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry majors. It provides the opportunity to socialize with other students and learn more about various programs at the University.  With this group I helped give science presentations to middle school students and attended talks by researchers at UD., National Merit Scholar Finalist The National Merit Scholarship is awarded to high school students with outstanding scores on the PSAT/NMSQT test.  Finalist status requires meeting additional academic standards., John W. Berry Sr. Scholars Program This is the highest academic scholarship at the University of Dayton, and is awarded to about 30 incoming students each year.  The program intends to foster fellowship among the scholars and provide additional opportunities for learning.  I participated in a leadership session the summer before entering UD, and have completed a sequence of six seminar courses with other scholars.  I have found the courses challenging while enjoying class discussion with a group that is engaged in the material.  These courses lead to the  Engineering Design Seminar, taught by Dr. David Herrelko.  In this course, I was part of a team that tackled a real world problem:  a City of Dayton official had asked for help determining ways for the city to improve services and cut costs by cooperating with other jurisdictions.  My four person group focused on possibilities for cooperation between the city and county departments that enforce building codes.  In December 2007, we delivered our final document and a summary presentation to city officials., The Bro. John. J. Lucier, S.M., Award of Excellence This recognition is awarded each year by the University of Dayton Chemistry Department to a single Junior majoring in Chemistry.  It recognizes academic excellence."

    "text": "Children, as patients, are almost never found in the Surgical ICU at Ohio State's university hospital where I volunteer, which is why it was so unusual for an 8-year-old girl to be admitted following heart surgery. She had an initial surgery performed at Columbus Children's Hospital, but the severity of her heart condition required she be transferred to OSU for a follow-up surgery. While seeing such a young patient in the SICU may have been atypical, the gamut of emotions her family was experiencing was not. Their unease and concern were evident in the way they paced and fidgeted in their seats, and it was difficult for me knowing all I could offer them was a tissue or a cup of coffee every time they would ask me how their daughter, granddaughter, or niece was doing. When the surgery was finally completed, and I informed the family they could briefly visit her, their relief was palpable. As I escorted her mother and grandmother to her room they spoke to me about how difficult it was waiting through the two surgeries in a period of just two days, as well as trying to stay informed during the transfer between both hospitals. Listening to them describe the mental and emotional distress the entire process put them through helped me understand how hard it can be on the family, not just the patient. These moments, which occur with almost every family that comes to the SICU for the first time, help me understand the impact health issues have on people and drive me to want to play a more meaningful role in providing care to others.   Situations such as this have shown me that in addition to the medical knowledge, physicians need to possess personal qualities, such as a strong ability to actively listen to others and a sense of empathy for others in order to provide optimal care.  I have learned that the ability to put yourself in someone else's place and understand how they are affected by the situation, as well as patiently listening to what they have to say, is invaluable when trying to provide aid.  Experiences such as volunteering in the SICU and Physicians Free Clinic, as well as personal encounters with family health issues, have strengthened these qualities in me, and continue to do so.   The ability to put yourself in someone else's place and understand how they are affected by the situation is invaluable when trying to provide aid. As a volunteer in the SICU, I deal primarily with the patients' families. I see firsthand the anguish that often accompanies dealing with the difficult circumstances of not knowing what to expect or how to deal with the uncertainty of a sick family member. Repeatedly seeing the duress under which families find themselves in times of stress has helped me become better attuned to interacting with them. In addition, having observed the doctors in the SICU talk to the families about their loved ones has been very insightful. Certainly they are appreciative of the doctor's medical expertise, but the families are put at ease when the doctor approaches them in a way that shows sensitivity to their plight. In general, my time in the SICU has helped me develop a better understanding of how to deal with people even when they are in the midst of a personal crisis. The ability to see the situation from the family's point of view enables me to effectively communicate with them, and this ability is also a valuable attribute when providing care to others.   This experience has also taught me that there are numerous ways to gather information about an individual's condition, but the most personal method is by talking to the patient. By talking with and, more importantly, listening to the patient, a doctor can accomplish at least two objectives: 1) gather information about a patient's condition based on their personal experience, and 2) help set a patient at ease by letting them voice their concerns and feelings about what they are experiencing. Obviously, most people are not trained medical professionals, and therefore do not listen to others with the intention of making a medical evaluation. In fact even in non-medical situations, lending an ear provides comfort to those who need to voice their troubles. My time volunteering in the SICU is primarily devoted to acting as a liaison between the family or friends of patients and the medical staff. There are a variety of responsibilities associated with this position, but the majority of my time is spent listening to individuals who are having difficulty dealing with the mental and emotional stress of the situation. While I cannot tell them anything about a patient's prognosis or even a patient's current medical condition, they almost always seem to benefit from having someone listen to them while they voice their anxiety. Listening is probably the most important part of working in the SICU, whether it is listening to individuals visiting patients or the medical staff, and it is something that is just as valuable for physicians.    I would expect to grow in this area just as I expect to grow in my knowledge regarding the scientific basis of disease and its treatments. Working with patients is a privilege. As such, patients deserve nothing less than careful attention to and mastery of both the science and people elements of medicine. Medina General Hospital 60 hours of volunteer service was required for graduation from my high school.  I had a strong interest in pursuing a medical career.   Consequently, I chose to select a volunteer experience that would provide better insight into the medical environment.  During this time I transferred charts, assist families in locating patients and relayed orders to and from the pharmacy.  This experience provided me with insights into some of the workings of a smaller community hospital., Programmer Analyst As a programmer analyst at LimitedBrands, my responsibilities include application planning, development, and support occurring in both individual and team environments. This includes working with non-technical users to derive requirements for potential systems, as well as working with technical individuals to plan and create those systems. Project and time management are very important aspects in terms of being a successful programmer, and my time working on highly visible, time-sensitive projects has helped me better develop my abilities in these areas. While programming certainly provides a number of unique technical challenges that are not found in many other disciplines, the rapid changes that occur in programming languages and techniques force me to constantly learn and adjust. This same ability continuously assimilate new information is valuable in medicine as new data and treatments are constantly made available to physicians., Columbus Reads As a tutor in the Columbus Reads program, I was matched up with 2 6-year-old children at Lincoln Park Elementary School. The tutoring entailed helping the children a better understnding of the material they were covering in calls that week., LUCAP (1999) During spring break of my junior year, I spent some of my time participating in a tutoring program for 1-4 grade students. The students were selected by their teachers as requiring additional assistance with material they covered in class. The program itself was organized though Loyola Univeristy of New Orleans and serviced a local inner city school., LUCAP (2000) During spring break of my senior year, I spent some of my time participating in a tutoring program for 1-4 grade students. The students were selected by their teachers as requiring additional assistance with material they covered in class. The program itself was organized though Loyola Univeristy of New Orleans and serviced a local inner city school., Columbus Children's Hospice I've been registered as a volunteer in the hospice program at Columbus Children's for a little over 6 months, but to date there have not been any matches in terms of families looking for assistance. Consequently, my time in the program has been limited to single events that the hospice team participates in for the benefit of the children and their families., Surgical ICU My responsibility as a volunteer in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) is primarily to serve a conduit for communication between the medical staff and the family members and friends of patients in the SICU. Obviously patients in the SICU are in relatively critical condition, and this consequently creates a potentially stressful situation for everyone involved for everyone involved. In addition to pushing me to further improve my ability to empathize and communicate with individuals/groups concerning sensitive health-related topics, it allowed me to learn about how people other than the patients themselves are affected by difficult situations resulting from illness and disease. Finally, volunteering in the SICU as provided me the opportunity to further observe doctors in situations in which they deal with patients and other medical staff., Student Aide My time working in the Systems Analysis department at Miami was a job I had taken primarily to earn money to help cover living expenses. It essentially consisted of performing various clerical duties as required., Columbus Physicians Free Clinic This is an organization that provides health care for underprivileged and uninsured individuals. As a voluneer, I have performed a variety of duties including taking patient history, patient vitals, and patient registration. It has been an enlightening experience, and has allowed me to observe doctor/patient interaction. In addition, I have also seen first-hand how many different groups of people are unable to afford medical care in the Columbus area., Akron Clinic/Akron General Hospital Walsh Jesuit High School required graduating seniors to select a specific career path of potential interest and shadow an individual(s) in that discipline for a block of three weeks. I selected radiology and spent my time at the Akron Clinic and Akron General Hospital. Over the course of the three weeks, I witnessed multiple procedures including angiography, CT scans, MRIs, myelograms, and x-rays. In addition, I sat in on the interpretations of the results of the CTs, MRIs, and x-rays. It was an interesting experience that allowed me to see into a more diagnostic side of medicine."

    "text": "My father used to tell me Learn from your past, and apply it to your future!  Everything in life does not always go as one might plan, but things do happen for a reason.  When things go astray, it is what the individual does in response that helps define them as a person.  I have had several such experiences that I think have influenced the direction of my life.         I applied to several different colleges my senior year of high school.  My first choice and life long dream was to attend the University of Notre Dame.  I received a letter in the mail one afternoon notifying me I was denied admission.  I was very disappointed and consequently, not as excited for the start of my college career.  Fortunately, I was accepted to Miami University, with a partial academic scholarship.  I eventually decided to embrace my opportunity at Miami, and everything worked out for the best.  I was determined to be successful, even though life did not go as I had planned.             Entering college, I had been a successful student.  I did not talk in class, ask teachers for assistance, or consult classmates on problems.  I thought all I needed was in the books or library, and it was my job as a student to figure it out.  I did not see the significance of interacting with professors or working with other students.  This strategy worked well until my sophomore year.  I figured my approach to studying was correct with my previous successes.  However, I found out the hard way that classes do not have to be independent studies.  In order to be successful, I learned to utilize all my resources, which includes a teacher's expertise on a subject and other students' methods for studying.  By utilizing other people's knowledge as a resource, I was able to study more freely and develop multiple avenues through which to accumulate information and knowledge.  I was successful in this adjustment and able to raise my grades closer to a level more representative of my abilities.           This past summer I was confident I would be attending medical school this fall.  I assumed that I had sufficient credentials to be accepted.  Once again, life did not go as planned.  Not being offered admission caused me to step back and reflect on my goals and aspirations.  This gave me time to decide if this was right for me.  Mostly everything I had done in my life was to prepare me for the next step in this commitment to becoming a physician.  With this extra time, I have further prepared myself for this journey.  I look forward to continuing my education in health care, and am motivated to learn from my past to achieve better results in the future.              Life's path usually does not travel a straight line through each goal as an individual desires.  Life has thrown some turns at me, but I have improved myself and benefited from each one.  Things have happened for a reason, and I am more determined than ever to keep my eyes on a career in medicine, no matter what the path.  I will reach my goals by learning from my past, and applying it to my future! Book Store Clerk After I completed my undergrad work in December, I stayed in Oxford with the job I had at the bookstore.  I stocked shelves with books, ran a register, and helped students locate their books.  This job paid well and helped me pay off some of my college education., Event Staff During the past two summers I worked part time at night for the Cincinnati Reds' security during baseball games.  My job duties were to keep the peace at the games and keep a family friendly atmosphere.  This job provided nightly hours where I could produce some income, while still leaving days available to volunteer through health care related venues., Shadow/Volunteer Every chance I have gotten, I have shadowed a physician or volunteered my time at a hospital.  I have been fortunate to be associated with doctors who willingly help me expand my experiences.  I have been introduced to many different types of physicians, including (but not limited to) ENTs, orthopaedic surgeons, and general practitioners. I have observed many surgeries, such as a colon resection, gall bladder removal, and a total knee replacement.  I have also followed a few physicians while doing rounds between surgeries.  I have had, and will continue to have, a great time with these experiences and I always look forward to what will come on my next visit.  These experiences have helped me understand the daily strain and intensity of a doctor's life.  I now know better the reality of being a doctor and am truly motivated to pursue a medical career., Check Processor/Data Entry Fifth Third Bank hired me to process checks for big businesses with accounts at our bank.  I also helped the company by doing data entry tasks during their busy times.  This job was a good working experience and helped me learn to manage my money better., Customer Service Representative I am a customer service representative at a Fifth Third Bank Mart in Cincinnati.  I perform daily tasks as customer transcations, balancing my drawer and helping maintain a smoothly run bank.  There is a lot of responsible and trust involved with this job.  I have learned how to deal with different personalities and also how to better handle my own financial situation., Vice President I joined this organization my freshman year and enjoyed my experiences enough to become its vice president.  Through this fraternity, I participated in relay-for-life (fundraiser for cancer patients), an annual Easter egg hunt for local children, and an adopt-a-highway program to clean up the streets of Oxford, OH.  I was appointed fundraising chair during my junior year, and we were very successful in collecting funds for our annual activities.  I was then elected vice president and was responsible for all the committees and aiding the president at local, regional and national meetings., Student Worker I worked shifts in the dish room washing dishes and at the student entrance accepting payments for meals.  This job helped teach me to manage my time better and allowed me to meet many new people freshman year., Student Research Assistant In order to more thoroughly understand the day to day life of a physician, I got a part time job working in an orthopaedic office.  My duties included (but were not limited to) maintaining the orthopaedic trauma database for University Hospital, contacting patients to inform them of clinics to attend in the office, and observing physicians and their assistants.  This employment opportunity allowed to me to more fully see the day to day office environment of a doctor.  This experience, coupled with observing surgeries with other physicians, has strengthened my resolve to enter medical school., Intramurual Sports Captain Intramural sports were a big part of my college career.  I loved the interaction and competition that they provided, which is why I set up and led most of my teams throughout college.  I captained our broomball, softball, and flag football teams.  We were not always the most successful, but we had fun as a team.  I learned a lot of leadership, administrative, communicative, and organizational skills through these teams., Undergraduate Research Aide Our lab examined sympathetic neurons located in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), which innervates peripheral tissues in the head and extracerebral blood vessels. These post-ganglionic neurons receive innervations almost exclusively from pre-ganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. It is not clear what neurotrophins regulate pre-ganglionic neurons in spinal cord. Recently, NT-4, produced in the post-ganglionic neurons, has been suggested as a source of pre-ganglionic regulation. In this study, I used a marker for the NT-4 receptor (trkB) to examine the pre-ganglionic innervations to the aged SCG and trkB receptor expression in aged sympathetic neurons. The localization of trkB receptors was determined by immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody for trkB receptor.  Sections of extracted spinal cord and SCG were stained with the antibody, rinsed, and then a fluorescent marker was added.  Positive cell bodies in the aged (compared to young) spinal cord and axons in the SCG were examined for qualitative and quantitative changes. We observed trkB in the SCG and in the spinal cord and slight reduction in trkB receptor in the aged samples. These results found with a limited sample size were rewarding and exciting. This research opportunity increased my knowledge of neuroscience and lab techniques., Temporary Worker Provident Bank hired me through a temporary service agency to work for the summer months of 2003 in the real estate owned department.  After completing the first semester of my junior year, I was asked to come back and work for the three weeks that I was in Cincinnati for Christmas break.  I helped the employees in this department with many tasks to aide their real estate sales, closings and legal paperwork.  I was able to learn quite a bit about real estate, loans, and mortgages through my work with Provident Bank., Dean's List Students with a GPA of 3.5 or better for one semester are placed on the dean's list and get an award.  I was on this list five times during my college career., National Scholar This organization awards those students with exceptional grades and leadership every year.  I was fortunate enough to be selected every year of my college career., Pharmacy Technician While working in the pharmacy, I filled prescriptions, entered scripts into the database, and helped out with customer service. Working this job through high school and off and on while in college, I learned much about the world of prescription drugs and insurance.  Working with patients to get them exactly what they needed was the best part of this working experience."

    "text": "In September of 2005 my friend Mark learned that he had an astrocytoma, a type of brain cancer, the prognosis for which statistics indicate an average survival of ten years from diagnosis.  Understandably, learning more about his condition quickly became a priority for Mark and his wife Meridith, who found an overwhelming amount of information on the internet.  With the guidance of an online support group, Meredith was directed to a nutritionist to learn how changes in Mark's diet might prolong his survival and even stop the growth of the tumor completely. This news was encouraging especially because only part of Mark's cancer was operable.  With the results of a recent brain scan indicating that there has been no growth of his tumor in three years, Mark and his wife are hopeful that he will greatly surpass the survival estimate.  Learning about Mark's condition and the holistic approach that he and his wife are taking has contributed to a growing interest of mine to pursue a career in medicine. I first became interested in medicine as an undergraduate out of wanting to pursue a career that combined my interests in both the physical and social sciences.  As an undergraduate at the University of Cincinnati I pursued coursework in the fields of economics and philosophy in addition to that of my concentration in biology.  Since my graduation from the University of Cincinnati I have continued to pursue these interests by completing a masters program in biology at Wright State University, becoming a registered emergency medical technician (EMT), and participating in two study abroad programs addressing the health and social issues of developing countries, one in Ecuador and another in Cameroon. These experiences have furthered my desire to pursue a career in medicine and to continue to explore my interests in biology, nutrition, and the social sciences.  Presently, I am finishing a masters program in nutrition at the University of Cincinnati and preparing to begin a research project investigating the effects of enteral fish oil in a population of mechanically ventilated patients.  In addition to working on my thesis this summer, I hope to participate in another study abroad program as well.  Studying abroad has provided me with a valuable global perspective of healthcare.  Learning about infectious diseases in Ecuador introduced me to the global fight against tuberculosis, and visiting a number of nongovernmental organizations in Cameroon taught me more about the challenges facing health educators in Africa to distribute information and counter misconceptions about HIV.  Through studying abroad I have learned that there is much more to the practice of medicine than the diagnosis and treatment of disease.  Nowhere has this been clearer to me than at Reach Out, a free clinic in Dayton Ohio, where I volunteered as an EMT.  In addition to reinforcing my desire to pursue a career in medicine, my interactions with patients and physicians demonstrated for me the reality that there is a significant portion of the population that is without access to healthcare. The consequences of social inequalities are evident at Reach Out every night as the clinic's doors open to a pack of people willing to wait up to four hours to see a physician.  That many wait with the knowledge that the clinic is unable to accommodate everyone in the waiting room is a testament to the legitimacy of their healthcare needs.  Witnessing the number of patients treated at Reach Out on a given night made me realize the void that the clinic fills in the Dayton area and the likely state of the situation across the country.  My experiences at Reach Out have made me realize the importance of gaining a better understanding of the challenges facing our healthcare system and the value of completing a masters degree program in public health, which I will begin this fall at the University of Cincinnati. In addition to providing an opportunity to establish a more complete understanding of an evidence-based approach toward public health and a fuller understanding of the factors influencing healthcare policy decision making, I believe that earning a master's degree in public health will leave me better prepared to pursue my interests in international health and more capable of assuming a leadership role in the field of medicine.  Having thus far prepared myself for the scientific demands of a career in medicine through my undergraduate and graduate coursework, I believe that earning an MPH degree will further aid me in my progress towards becoming a well rounded physician.  My desire to be a physician stems from my belief that it is a profession in which I can excel, contribute and find personal fulfillment.  In my time at both Wright State and the University of Cincinnati I have developed a deep appreciation for learning and a strong motivation to be a positive influence in the lives of others. I regard a career in medicine as one that presents both the unique opportunity to combine these interests as well as a consistent challenge to better both myself and the profession. Since making the decision to pursue a career in medicine, my volunteer and work experiences have affirmed my conviction and strengthened my resolve towards achieving this goal. Tropical Disease Workshop in Ecuador An interest in global healthcare prompted me to pursue this opportunity to study abroad as part of a program through Ohio University.  As a participant of the 14th Tropical Disease Workshop I spent two weeks in August of 2006 traveling throughout Ecuador to different villages and hospitals.  The theme of the workshop was Communication and Infectious Disease Management at the Community Level and Vector-Borne Diseases.  Along with fourteen other students I learned about tropical diseases, the social and economic factors that influence their prevalence, and the community health initiatives aimed at controlling them.  We had the opportunity to compare and contrast public and private healthcare facilities and to experience both traditional and modern forms of medicine being practiced in Ecuador.  Through knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys that we gave at each of the communities we visited, we were able to gain a better understanding of the unique challenges facing each., Assistant Teaching-Assistant As a microbiology lab assistant teaching assistant my responsibilities included demonstrating aseptic technique, explaining various aspects of the material, and assisting in the up keep of the lab.  The class met twice a week for three hours at a time., Press Operator As a press operator at Blackhawk Automotive Plastics during the summers of 2001 and 2003 I learned the value of a day's work and developed a sense of determination that has come to characterize my work ethic., Emergency Room Volunteer As a volunteer in the emergency room at Deaconess Hospital I assisted the hospital staff in tasks such as making beds, transporting patients, and stocking supplies.  In addition to these duties I also had the opportunity to shadow doctors and observe them interacting with patients.  My experiences at Deaconess Hospital taught me a lot about the medical profession and the many demands of being a physician.  I found interacting with the hospital staff and their patients to be a rewarding and self-fulfilling experience.  Learning about each patient motivated me to want to learn more about the science behind the medicine, while the personal satisfaction that came from helping in any way I could reaffirmed my desire to be a physician., Medical/Surgical Intensive Care Unit Volunteer As a volunteer in the Medical Surgical Intensive Care Unit at Good Samaritan Hospital my responsibilities included maintaining the waiting room and coordinating the visitation of patients' family and friends with the hospital staff.  During this time I was able to learn a lot from talking with patients' family about their experiences.  Through observing interactions between physicians and their patients' family I gained a deeper appreciation for the dynamic nature of the profession and the many roles that physicians must fulfill as healthcare providers., Miamitown Pet Hospital As an employee of the Miamitown Pet Hospital my job responsibilities included washing and waxing the floors twice a month, painting, and other maintenance tasks.  In addition to these duties I was able to observe surgical procedures and aid in caring for the animals.  Though I first became employed at the Miamitown Pet Hospital as a college student, my experiences there began long before this time.  My father is one of the veterinarians at the hospital and the time spent accompanying him on farm calls and assisting him in emergency surgeries is largely responsible for my interest in the physical sciences., Reach Out Clinic At the Reach Out Clinic in Dayton, Ohio I volunteer as an emergency medical technician (EMT) once or twice a month for four hours at a time.  My main responsibility is to triage patients, which consists of a brief medical assessment and a recording of vital signs, but I also assist in other duties as needed.  When not triaging I have the opportunity to shadow some of the physicians that are volunteering their time.  Volunteering at Reach Out has been a very valuable experience that has allowed me to gain experience interacting with patients., Sixth/Seventh Grade Football Coach Four days a week I help coach a grade school football team at St. Ignatius Elementary.  This will be my second year coaching at St. Ignatius, the season runs from August to November., Infinite Nutrition From January 2008 through June 2008 I worked production for Michael Folan at Infinite Nutrition.  Infinite Nutrition is a company that makes custom sports drinks., Science Tutor I began tutoring students in freshman chemistry during the fall quarter of 2003 and later tutored students in organic chemistry, biology and physics following my completion of these courses.  When I graduated from high school in 2001 a career in medicine was not the obvious choice.  I had so many interests that I found it difficult to focus on one in particular.  Pressure early on to simply set a course and follow it led me to enroll in math and science courses that I had no interest in taking.  My performance in these classes reflected my lack of conviction but did not speak for my abilities as a student.  My desire to be a physician has motivated me to become proficient as both a student and a teacher.  Along with improving my academic performance, the belief that a life long devotion to learning should benefit both self and society has motivated me to seek active involvement in the education of others through working as a science tutor, serving as an academic advisor to my fraternity, and teaching as a microbiology lab assistant teaching assistant.  Though many professions rely on this ability, I regard the medical profession to be particularly dependent on being able to assume the dual role of teacher and student., Chapter Scholar of the Year In recognition for my work as Scholarship Chairman for The Sigma Chi Fraternity I was named Chapter Scholar of Year (2004-2005)., Technologist Associate My experiences as a technologist associate in the microbiology department at LabOne has made me more aware of the extensive network of individuals involved in meeting the healthcare needs of the community.  My responsibilities included receiving specimens, setting up lab tests, relaying results to physicians and hospital staff, problem resolution, and answering questions regarding testing and collection procedures.  I learned a lot about clinical lab science and health care in general. These experiences and others have given me a profound respect for healthcare professionals and the desire to make my own contribution., The Sigma Chi Fraternity My involvement in the Sigma Chi Fraternity has been an integral part of my personal growth and development over the past four years.  During this time I held two year-long elected offices, scholarship (2004-2005) and risk management (2005-2006), participated in intramural athletics, and contributed to community service and philanthropy endeavors.   As the scholarship chairman I oversaw the chapter's academic performance and provided academic advice for struggling students.  At the time I took over the office our chapter's G.P.A. was 2.4 and our house had been placed on academic suspension by the university. Having implemented a study table program for brothers whose G.P.A was under a 2.2 and a reward system for brothers with the most improved G.P.A. I helped bring our chapter off of academic probation and raise our house G.P.A to 2.9.  As risk manager it was my responsibility to ensure that activities and events held at our chapter were registered with the university and provided a safe environment.  These experiences have allowed me to develop leadership abilities and interpersonal skills that I believe to be essential to succeeding as a medical professional., Cameroon Immersion: Youth, Development, & the MDGs Through the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Global Youth Partnership for Africa (GYPA) I had the opportunity to travel throughout Cameroon with 15 other American students and 15 Cameroon students for two weeks in June of 2007.  The context of our travels was to learn about Cameroon and the steps being taken towards achieving the Millennium Developmental Goals (MDGs) set by the United Nations.  These eight goals call for the eradication of poverty, universal primary education, gender equality, the reduction of child mortality, improved maternal health, decreased prevalence of HIV, malaria and other diseases, environmental stability, and the development of a global partnership for development.  My experiences in Cameroon have broadened my world view and allowed me to gain a more complete perspective on the issues facing developing countries.  By meeting with a number of different NGO's working in the country we were able to learn about each one's particular focus and the different strategies being used to accomplish their tasks., University of Cincinnati College of Medicine Student Helper Working in the Pathology Department at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine has given me a fuller understanding of the structure of medical education and the demands of being a medical student.  As a student helper my responsibilities included scanning lecture slides, preparing power point presentations, miscellaneous office work, and assisting in daily activities such as an annual phlebotomy workshop.  The exposure has been useful in deciding how to further prepare for medical school.  By taking challenging and diverse coursework I have become a more capable and well rounded student.  These experiences and others have convinced me that I have the aptitude and the determination to succeed in medical school."

    "text": "Over the past year I have been working as an AmeriCorps*VISTA volunteer for the Cincinnati Center for Peace Education.  The Center provides students, administrators, and parents with the training, resources, strategies, and experiences needed to value differences and manage conflicts constructively.  Even though this past year has been most rewarding in that I have obtained new skills in mediation and conflict management, I have gained something else.  I can now offer real-life experience in a non-medical, socially-focused field and use skills that I have learned in a future medical career.  Beyond doubt, I can now say that I wish to spend my life caring and teaching others about their health as a physician.  Throughout my year of AmeriCorps service, I kept finding myself thinking and yearning for a future career in medicine.  My lunch hours and evenings were mostly spent keeping up with the fields of science and medicine through reading online news articles.  But, most of all, I kept recalling my past experiences being a research lab technician in the Foresite study at University of Cincinnati Neurosurgery Department and volunteering in the bone marrow transplant unit at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.  As a research lab technician in the Neurosurgery Department I was lucky enough to have the thrill of being on-call one day weekly from 5pm through 8am and one weekend monthly from 5pm Friday until 8am Monday.  Granted the thrill wore off after the second or third 3am page, but I still loved being called to take pupil dilatory response readings for three hours because of the experience.  When paged, I was given the opportunity to catch a glimpse of how the neurosurgical and surgical intensive care units functioned.  Because all of my readings were obtained from comatose patients with severe head trauma, I was privileged to see a little bit of how nurses and doctors work to help patients who are unable to verbally communicate to their caregivers.  My most memorable and shocking experience during my position as a research lab technician was when I witnessed a patient flat-line.  I was called one evening to start a new patient in the Foresite study and it seemed like all the other cases for which I was paged.  However, as soon as I stepped into the patient's room and was about to introduce myself to the patient's family, the monitors all began to alarm.  Nurses and doctors immediately bolted past me and began performing their own pre-designated tasks.  My first instinct was to step forward to help somehow, but then my reason kicked in and I backed my way out of the room.  While standing at the nurse's station, I could not help but to watch the rhythmic motions of each person who joined together to work as one machine.  Later upon reflecting on this experience, I sensed the feelings of wanting to help and being willing to step forward as affirmation to my calling and desire to become a physician.  My experiences on the bone marrow transplant unit at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center also further cemented my desire to become a physician.  As a volunteer in the bone marrow transplant unit I was given the task to go into rooms of children who were unable to play in the activity center for various reasons.  One day the Child Life Specialist asked me if I would be willing to spend time with a teenage male, Mike, who had not been very cooperative with the nursing staff.  Being up for the challenge, I decided to enter the young man's room.  While introducing myself, I could tell he was very apprehensive to welcome a new person into his room.  But as I continued to talk, I convinced Mike to play a couple rounds of video games.  We had a wonderful time over the next two hours but when I left he asked me very tough question.  Very seriously he said, Hey, I'm going to see you next week, right In our volunteer training they were very specific about these situations because as volunteers we knew nothing about their medical history and therefore we could not promise them anything (including seeing us again).  So I responded jokingly, Not if I see you first, and walked out of the room.  This became our routine over the next month.  One week, however, while I was in Mike's room, his doctor came with some news concerning his condition.  By the look on the physician's face I could tell this was not good news and therefore I began to leave to ensure Mike's privacy.  Before I got very far, Mike told me to stay because he did not want to hear this news alone.  The doctor very carefully then explained that over the last week Mike's condition had declined and recent tests showed that he had contracted a fungus.  After the physician left and despite the bad news, Mike and I played more video games and cards until it was time to leave once again.  And like all the previous weeks, Mike tearfully asked, Hey, I'm going to see you next week, right and I responded, Not if I see you first.  As I walked down the hall I could not but help feel the same emotions I had had as I had watched the patient flat-line.  I wished that I could have helped more somehow.  I yearned to learn skills that would enable me to spend my life caring and teaching others about their health as a physician. Research Lab Technician As a research lab technician at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center Neurosurgery Department, I was on-call one day weekly from 5pm to 8am and one weekend monthly from 5pm Friday to 8am Monday.  Through this experience I was able to work with the Forsite and IVH study under the direction of Suzaane Kempisty-Cliver (RN).  I was also given the invaluable opportunity to interact with patients in a clinical trial setting along with doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff in the surgical and neurological intensive care units., AmeriCorps*VISTA volunteer at the Center for Peace Education Being that I was able to complete my undergraduate curriculum in three years, I wanted to dedicate the year that most individuals use to complete their undergraduate education to serving the Cincinnati community.  For the past 25 years Center for Peace Education has taught students, teachers, and parents essential life skills on how to resolve conflict constructively, interact with peers effectively, and appreciate the unique perspective of others, in order to create dynamic future community leaders and a positive nurturing community.  My duties as an AmeriCorps*VISTA included running a sustainable after-school Peace Club and summer Peace Camp programs where I coordinated community volunteers and trained staff to help schools and communities.  Over my year of service I personally organized over 750 hours logged by community volunteers and gained skills in mediation and conflict management., Student Currently I am enrolled to take a Biochemistry course from Xavier University during the upcoming fall semester.  This opportunity will not only get me back into the routine of studying and student life, but will also provide me with material that I will most definitely revisit in medical school.  In the event that class conflicts with my employment I will enroll in an evening Biochemistry course offered by the University of Cincinnati., Eagle Scout Award Given to only 1% of those who join scouting, this is Boy Scout's highest award.  For my Eagle project, I aided Kid's Cafe, a Cincinnati soup kitchen for children.  I refurbished a neighboring alley into a playground and supplied volunteers for a month following the Cincinnati riots of April, 2001., Research Lab Technichan I am currently in the application process to become a research technician at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.  If I am not hired I will find employment in a medically-related position in the greater Cincinnati area.  This will give me the opportunity to gain more experience in medical professions and enhance skills that will be beneficial in medical school., Member of Xavier University's Pre-Med Society I attended meetings and talks given by medical professionals and also did service through this organization.  For one group service project I planned a trip to Children's Hospital where members volunteered in an activity center for several hours., AAA Self-Secured Storage Manager I have worked at AAA Self-Secured Storage since the eighth grade and eventually reached the position of Evening/Weekend Manager.  As a manager I am in charge of making the monthly employee schedules, tabulating quarterly bonuses, and overseeing the maintenance and upkeep of the storage facility.  In addition to these duties I am on call nights and weekends to deal any emergencies and disgruntled tenants.  This experience has increased my abilities to work with others and deal with difficult situations., Member of Xavier University String Orchestra I played cello for three years with the Xavier University String Orchestra having played the cello since 4th grade. I have also traveled to England and Ireland where I preformed in eleven concerts as a member of the Cincinnati Junior Strings., Alpha Epsilon Delta Historian I was elected to the board as Historian following my induction in 2005.  As a member of this group, I participated in a minimum of 15 hrs of community service per semester and attended monthly meetings and events.  As a board member I was also involved with scheduling speakers for our monthly meetings and the selection process for prospective members., Member of Xavier University Student Alumni Association I was first nominated and then appointed to this organization.  Xavier University's Student Alumni organization assists with many alumni events and helps bridge the gap between current students and the alumni.  As a member of this organization I helped plan the Near Naked Mile, Homecoming, Cross-Town Help Out, and The Pancake Breakfast which are all run through Xavier's Alumni Office., Beside Volunteer In high school, I volunteered during the summer and was in both an activity center and the Emergency Department at Children's Hospital Medical Center.  During my first two years of college, I volunteered in the intensive care unit and the step-down unit interacting with children not able to play in the activity center.  During my last year of college and the subsequent summer, I volunteered in the bone marrow transplant unit interacting with children isolated in their rooms for numerous reasons.  This was my first real chance to experience the medical profession and really sparked my drive to become a physician., Member of a Koinonia Group Koinonia is a small faith-sharing community that meets to share, discuss, and pray over the significant issues in our lives.  Individual Xavier University Koinonia groups are led by students and meet weekly for a couple of hours.

    "text": "My decision to pursue a career in medicine was a fairly recent one, despite the fact that I've been exposed to the field my entire life. Growing up, I held the attitude that I needed to find my own way and shouldn't follow in the footsteps of my parents; however, subsequent life experiences have convinced me that medicine can provide a fulfilling career for which I can have a true passion.   My first professional aspirations developed in high school when I started a small computer business during my junior year. Within eighteen months, I had 220 clients and annual revenue of $30,000. As a result, Wake Forest University awarded me the Presidential Scholarship in Entrepreneurship.   Given this early accomplishment, I started college intending to earn a degree in Computer Science. I made good grades my freshman year, but after many late nights of sifting through computer code, I began to realize that this was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Although I had the ability to succeed in this field, I was simply not passionate about it. This realization motivated me to explore other career possibilities: I became heavily involved in politics during the 2002 elections, looked into several business opportunities, and developed a strong interest in economics, which later became my major.  Later that year I also began working part-time for my father, an ophthalmologist. I was trained as an ophthalmic technician to perform visual field tests, optic nerve scans, and basic acuity tests on glaucoma patients. These experiences were enlightening for me in that they gave me the ability to interact with patients and observe the decision-making process of a physician first-hand. They provided me with a new perspective on the actual practice of medicine compared to preconceived notions that I had. I discovered that although medicine is rooted in science, the application of this knowledge is truly an art. Two patients with identical diagnoses were sometimes treated quite differently. Tailoring treatment to the individual is of paramount importance. (How well might this patient tolerate a surgical procedure If a medication is prescribed, what sort of compliance level can we expect etc.)  There was also one minor incident that I found particularly meaningful. After finishing a visual field, I dropped the patient's chart on my dad's desk, where I noticed a 'Thank You' card. I picked it up out of curiosity, and I will never forget the simple note inside: Dear Dr. Burch, I cannot thank you enough for what you have done for me. My husband died last year, and my eyes had gotten so bad that my daughter had been looking into a retirement home for me. But since the [cataract] surgery, my vision is better than I could have ever imagined. I can continue to live independently and can even do crossword puzzles in the newspaper again! Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I don't mean to imply that my decision was a result of this single moment, but this incident caused me to consider what 'greater meaning' I want my professional life to have. Medicine provides the opportunity to change someone's life on a very fundamental level, and this sense of fulfillment is something that I don't see in a lot of other professions, nor have I experienced it in other fields. At times, I did enjoy running my own business, but I want my professional life to have a greater purpose than simply providing a product that people want.  My community service involvements, particularly Habitat for Humanity, have deepened my appreciation for this sense of fulfillment. The best part of working with Habitat is that I was able to observe the end results of our efforts first-hand. One great memory I have is from a project that I worked on in the spring of 2003. The home was nearing completion and I was installing a gutter when the family who would eventually be living in the house stopped by to help: a single mother and her two young children. The expression on her face as she walked around her new home was priceless. More than simply helping someone in need, this home was literally going to change the life of a family.  Another aspect of medicine I find exciting is the constant intellectual challenge it presents: the human body is so complex that there will always be more questions than answers. I gained a fuller understanding of this complexity at the University of Cincinnati in the summer of 2004. For three months I volunteered as a research assistant, studying just a few specific proteins in corneal epithelial cells; their structure and the mechanisms that they trigger are so intricate that one could spend thirty years studying them and still not fully understand them.  Since graduating from college three years ago, I have continued to seek out opportunities to gain exposure to the medical profession, including full-time employment in a family medicine residency program. I have also earned a Masters degree in physiology which incorporated several first-year medical school courses. All these experiences have strengthened both my desire and commitment to pursue a career in medicine. It is a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, an opportunity to serve, and an art I wish to master. President, Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity As fraternity president I supervised all Chapter operations, served as chair of the executive committee, and held a seat on the alumni association board. Our fraternity is quite unique in that we are only of the only voluntarily dry chapters in the country: no alcohol is permitted at any of our events or in our lounge areas. This allows us to focus on many of the positive aspects of fraternity life that are so commonly overlooked -- community service, academics, leadership development, etc. My involvement in Lambda Chi Alpha was one of the best and most formative experiences of my undergraduate years., Cancer Research Fundraiser As part of our emphasis on community service, my fraternity sponsors a major fundraiser each spring to benefit the Brian Piccolo Cancer Fund at Wake Forest. I was heavily involved in planning and organizing this annual event., Lambda Chi Alpha National Food Drive Each year Lambda Chi Alpha sponsors a nationwide food drive that typically brings in over 300,000 pounds. As president of the Wake Forest chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha, I both participated in the event and assisted with some of the planning., Habitat for Humanity I have participated in several Habitat projects in the Winston-Salem NC area and one in Cincinnati OH. I also volunteered at the 'Habitat Restore,' which sells donated hardware supplies and furniture at a discount to low-income families (similar to Goodwill)., Presidential Scholarship for Distinguished Achievement I received this 4-year scholarship from Wake Forest for approximately half-tuition. The scholarship recognized my achievements in entrepreneurship. As a high school junior I started a small business, A1 Access USA that provided dial-up Internet services throughout the United States and Canada. The business served about 220 clients at its peak., Hospital Volunteer (CCU) I volunteered in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center one shift per week. I served primarily as a liaison between the physicians/nurses and the families of CCU patients, assisting them in any way possible., Physician Shadowing I will be shadowing several physicians in the Cincinnati area over the next year, including an orthopedic surgeon, dermatologist, and interventional radiologist. My goal is gain exposure to a wide variety of specialties and identify those that I should consider as a possible career path., Research Assistant I worked with Dr. Kazuto Terai in the research lab of Dr. Winston Kao at the University of Cincinnati. Dr. Kao's research focuses on the study of corneal wound healing mechanisms through transgenic mice models. I learned a variety of laboratory techniques (use of restriction enzymes, Western Blot, gel electrophoresis, etc.) I also assisted Dr. Terai in writing/editing some of his research papers., Web Designer and Programmer, Knowledge2Work Knowledge2Work is a program at Wake Forest that provides technology services to local businesses and non-profits. I have created websites for many organizations and companies including Aramark and Jim Snyder for Lt. Governor. I also served as the finance officer for this organization in 2004. This role included creating a budget, monitoring expenditures, and meeting with university administrators to lobby for future support of the program., Hospital Volunteer (Emergency Room) Over the next year I will be volunteering at University Hospital in the Emergency Department. Since I am just starting this activity at the time of AMCAS submission, I don't have further details to provide. I would be glad to discuss this experience at the time of interview., Homeless Shelter Volunteer Samaritan Inn is a Christian homeless shelter where I typically worked one 12-hour shift per semester, assisting mainly with meal preparation and security. One of this organization's particular strengths (and a major reason I chose to volunteer there) is that it encourages and assists in finding employment rather than just providing food and shelter., Order of Omega The Order of Omega is a honor society at Wake Forest recognizing students who demonstrate excellence in academics, leadership, and community service. Approximately 30 Wake Forest students are chosen each year. I was nominated by my fraternity's faculty advisor and granted membership based on my academic and extracurricular record., Small Business Owner This is the small business I started in high school that provided dial-up Internet services to clients throughout the United States and Canada. At one point it served over 220 clients with annual revenues of about $30,000. As a result, Wake Forest University awarded me the Presidential Scholarship for Distinguished Achievement in Entrepreneurship. I sold the business in July 2006., Technical Coordinator, Family Medicine Residency Program This was my full-time job between college and graduate school. I worked for the residency program in Family Medicine at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. My responsibilities included scheduling of the Grand Rounds conferences, tracking of block schedules, monitoring of duty hours to ensure that the residents were in compliance with ACGME guidelines, and developing an electronic system for the attending physicians to evaluate residents.  I was also responsible for the department website (www.wfubmc.edu/fam_med), and I worked with Dr. Mark Andrews, the Residency Program Director, in developing ways to use technology to facilitate the residents' educational experience. This position gave me an excellent inside look at what life as a resident is like, and I also gained a greater appreciation for the role of primary care physicians. A recommendation letter from Dr. Andrews is included in my application., Ophthalmic Technician This was my part-time job during summer/winter breaks from college, and I will continue to work in this capacity over the next year (Aug 2009 - July 2010). I assist in preliminary examination of patients, especialy those with glaucoma. I perform a visual field test, a GDx scan of the retina, and a basic acuity test on about 10 patients per week. I am also able to observe a wide variety of more complex cases and small surgeries."

    "text": "The bitter wind of a winter morning stung my face as I sprinted over the final hurdle around the empty track.  The feeling of finishing first in a race is incomparable, but the race is really won long before it ever takes place.  It was on these cold winter mornings when the fire to pursue my dream of placing in the Conference and my will to win were all that kept me training.  When asked why I run hurdles, I respond that sprinting would be too easy otherwise.  I approach the decisions and difficulties of life with this same principle, knowing that it is only through dedication and hard work that I will succeed.  Experiences show us where we have been, but more importantly, they prepare us for what we will become.  My experiences have prepared me well to be a dedicated physician.  At Miami University I was a successful Division I athlete, musician, leader of two fellowship groups and worship team, and graduated Cum Laude with Honors in Microbiology.  Despite success in different arenas, my focus has remained on medicine because I found a dynamic field that satisfies my passion to serve people along with my love for academics and research.  The medical field is fast paced with many challenges, but what drives me toward the field is the satisfaction that at the end of the day I have made a difference in another person's life.  I became immersed in medicine at a young age with my father pursuing a doctorate in physical therapy and my mother working as a pharmacist.  My interest in medicine began when I volunteered at a physical therapy center in fourth grade.  At age 11, while cleaning whirlpools, I met a man with fractured legs from a car accident.  During his treatment, he explained how his bones were set using an external fixation device.  Fascinated, I began to think how I could become involved in a field that greatly improved the quality of life for people.  I further pursued my passion to assist others as I served at a therapy center and a nursing home through high school.  With my dream of becoming a physician ignited, experience in the medical field has confirmed my career path.  Over the past five years, I observed and assisted physician mentors in various fields, and I spent over 1500 hours in direct contact with patients as a Certified Nursing Assistant.  As a nursing assistant I find it both challenging and rewarding to assist patients who lack autonomy in their daily tasks.  I am developing a perceptive mind, humility to perform adverse tasks, a propensity to anticipate needs, and empathy to listen to patients and their families.  Although physically and mentally demanding, the reward is the trust and appreciation of my patients.  Injuries, tough coaches, and thousands of hours of training were among the difficulties I experienced in track, yet these obstacles helped shape my character.  In medicine, challenges have only strengthened my resolve to become a physician.  I have recently encountered the most difficult aspect of medicine: a patient's death.  Despite observing several code situations as a nursing assistant, nothing prepared me to see my own patient die.  Chester was in respiratory distress and coded only moments after I watched his wife kiss him for the last time.  We began CPR, but after 45 minutes he was pronounced dead, and I stopped chest compressions.  Experiencing this event and witnessing the grief of his family granted me a new appreciation for life and removed any doubt in my ability to handle the challenges along with the joys that accompany a career in medicine.  As in track, pursuing a career in medicine requires discipline.  It requires the will to succeed, but more importantly the love to train.  As I gain experience and mature as a student, my interests in medicine continue to expand.  By the summer of 2008, I will have a Master of Public Health degree in Epidemiology from The Ohio State University.  Out of ten thousand graduate students, I am one of 400 awarded a University Fellowship to conduct my studies during the 2007-08 academic year.  My current interest in infectious disease stems from my microbiology background, and combined with research performed on tuberculosis control last winter, I posses a solid foundation for research in immunology and infectious disease.  Because of my interests and academic success, the assistant director of Columbus Public Health recently invited me to begin work on tuberculosis research projects at their department this fall.  The administrative, statistical, and research experience gained from attaining an MPH will prepare me to not only treat individuals, but to work as a leader in the community by examining and responding to health threats and promoting health within the population.  Experiences define who I am and illuminate where I will go.  Serving patients shapes my desire to pursue medicine, while studies in Epidemiology provide a glimpse of the personal impact I can have on improving lives.  Becoming a great physician is my dream, and analogous to running, will require cold mornings of dedication and intense training, with the rewards far down the road.  I approach medicine with even greater ambition and determination, knowing this is how I will spend my life contributing to society.  Eric N. Bowman Men's Varsity Track and Field Team & Leadership All four years at Miami University I ran for the Varsity Men's Track and Field Team.  We spent an average of 12 hours training per week in the fall and spring, with all-day meets on Saturdays in the winter and spring.  I competed in the Mid-American Conference Championships all four years in the hurdles, taking 7th place in the conference my senior year.  I made the Mid-American Conference honor roll 3 years, and my senior year I received the MAC Presidential Award and was named to the Academic ALL MAC Team in 2006.  My coaches appointed me to the Miami University's Athletic Leadership Council as the men's track and field team representative for both my junior and senior years.  I worked with representatives of all varsity sports to assess policies and improve communication between athletes and the athletic administration.  Senior year my team voted me as team captain.  I learned to overcome injuries, developed strict self-discipline and leadership, and honed my time management skills through participating in track at the NCAA, Division I level., Sports Camp Counselor & Referee for Youth Sports At ages 15 and 16 I refereed youth soccer games during the fall and basketball games during the winter for SAY and the local YMCA.  I enjoyed helping 6 year olds learn how to play the sports, as well as helping the older youth play fair.  As a week long sports camp counselor at age 19, I worked with elementary school children for 25 hours.  Each day we presented a different sport and I helped the children with the drills in addition to coaching their games.  I had fun developing relationships with the children and encouraging them in athletics., Rehabilitation Center and Nursing Home Volunteering Beginning at 11 years old, I worked two summers at a physical and occupational therapy center, Samaritan North Rehabilitation Center, in Dayton, OH.  I volunteered 120 hours each summer I served there.  My first hands on experience in medicine involved cleaning weight machines, whirlpools, therapy tables and equipment, stocking supplies, and filing patient charts.  I felt comfortable in this environment and enjoyed my interactions with patients and medical staff.  Beginning at age 14, I served three consecutive summers at Walnut Creek Nursing Home in Moraine, OH.  I assisted the activities director 25 hours each summer.  We played games and sang songs with the residents, assembled puzzles, and even produced a short musical featuring the residents.  I also helped feed several of the residents.  Overall it was an enjoyable experience, but it was also my first encounter with Alzheimer's patients and their situation saddened me.  It was during those years that I learned how to love patients, expecting nothing in return except intrinsic satisfaction., Research in Immunology -- Heat Shock Protiens and Caspases During my junior and senior years I performed an extensive amount of library research in Immunology at Miami University.  My specific area of research was on the natural molecular mechanisms that cause anti-cancer treatments to be ineffective.  Heat shock proteins which normally protect cells from stress actually contribute to preventing chemotherapeutic drugs from eliminating tumor cells.  In my research, I identified the mechanisms by which this occurred and explored means of correcting this situation, with interference RNA for example.  I created a thirty-page analysis of a primary journal article with over thirty sources, and I created an hour-long PowerPoint presentation to present before my peers.  This opportunity acquainted me with various laboratory techniques, in depth scientific writing, and the art of presenting research., Nursing Assistant at Kettering Medical Center, Dayton, OH For five years I have been a Certified Nursing Assistant on an inpatient rehabilitation unit and an acute pulmonary/medical unit at Kettering Medical Center in Kettering, OH.  I initially completed a six-week training course, and I now work 40 hours per week during the summer and on breaks, totaling over 1500 hours of direct patient contact.  Through this position I receive a panoramic view of the healthcare system and increase my medical knowledge tremendously.  Working with teams of doctors, nurses, therapists, technicians, and families provides a comprehensive view of the important aspects of modern medicine: collaboration among specialists.  Dealing with stressful situations stretches my abilities and increases my capacity to extemporize during urgent circumstances.  Code situations, performing CPR, and dealing with patients dying strengthens me as an individual and provides a deeper desire to pursue a career in medicine.  It is humbling to perform daily activities for my patients: bathing and dressing them, cleaning up accidents and incontinence, or feeding them, but I gladly place their needs before my own comfort.  One valuable lesson I have learned as a nursing assistant, is to listen to my patients and their families in order to provide the best possible care., Volunteering in a Clinic at a Youth Sports Camp For one week last summer I volunteered and observed in a medical clinic at a youth sports camp in Lampe, Missouri.  I assisted the doctors in treating the campers with everything from colds to perforated eardrums and esophageal ulcers.  It was an enjoyable and educational experience to help treat campers at a large youth sports camp., Assistance of a Primary Care & Sports Medicine Physician For the past four years, I have regularly volunteered and observed in a primary care and sports medicine physician's office.  Dr. Barrow introduced me to the skill of interviewing patients and we discus diseases, injuries, and therapies in depth as I assist him.  He also allowed me to assist in unique opportunities such as bone resetting and early detection of a myocardial infarct.  When I shadow him, I experience the day-to-day life a physician including the enjoyable moments along with the challenges.  I understand the amount of logistics involved, but also experience the joy and importance of communication and relationships with patients.  Since Dr. Barrow is a team physician for a local high school and university, he works with many young athletes.  He is very involved in the community and is an excellent mentor., Miami University Collegiate Chorale I auditioned for and joined the Miami University Collegiate Chorale during my sophomore year at Miami.  We sang a wide variety of classical, gospel, and contemporary choral works, and worked with an instrumental group to perform a variety of pieces from India, Cuba, and Native American culture.  This experience opened my eyes to many different cultures and provided a welcomed experience in the arts., Leadership Positions for Two Campus Ministries I developed stronger leadership skills while involved all four years with Campus Crusade and Athlete's in Action at Miami.  Appointed to the leadership team for Campus Crusade for Christ (an organization of 900 students), and independently to the leadership team for Athlete's in Action, I worked with a small group of students to plan and asses goals and activities for each student organization.  With Athlete's in Action, I began and then led a small group for the men's track team for three years, and provided leadership during this past year at Ohio State for the organization.  I also led a musical band for the weekly Campus Crusade meetings by playing guitar and singing.  My goal was to be a positive influence on my teammates/classmates through service and leading by example.  Through this experience I learned to respect diverse ideas, to value trust between collaborators, and learned the importance of a leader to be teachable and humble., Observation of Physicians I had the opportunity to observe an orthopedic surgeon as well as a cardiologist for 25 hours each.  By following Dr. Klosterman, an orthopedic surgeon, both in the office and several times in the operating room, I experienced a comprehensive view of the orthopedic specialty.  I watched several ACL reconstructions, rotator cuff repairs, and a variety of other procedures.  I also observed a total knee replacement, which completely fascinated me.  Dr. Klosterman is also a team doctor for the University of Dayton athletics and shared the nuances of working with college athletes.  I also followed Dr. Rogers, a cardiologist, for several days.  In addition to learning the basics of cardiology, I witnessed stress tests, echocardiograms, and proper analysis of EKGs.  One hospital we attended in an underserved area inspired me to consider working with underserved populations.  Dr. Rogers taught clearly and possessed exemplary patient interaction.  These opportunities allowed me to develop a strong appreciation for different specializations in medicine., Parkinson Therapy Research -- Deep Brain Stimulation I performed research on Deep Brain Stimulation for treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease in association with Dr. Taha and nurses at Kettering Hospital.  Dr. Taha was one of the first surgeons in the nation to begin using these treatments, and provided patients we could monitor for outcomes.  I specifically focused on the long-term effectiveness of the procedure as well as the rehabilitation process and outcomes associated with the treatment.  By reviewing literature and patient functionality assessments, we were able to describe the effectiveness of the procedure, as well as the level of success a rehabilitation program could have in conjunction with the treatment., University Fellowship Award I was nominated and granted the University Fellowship Award for studies in Epidemiology for the 2007-08 academic year.  After nomination by The Ohio State College of Public Health, the Graduate School Committee selected me in the university-wide competition involving more than one-thousand nominees.  The Graduate School congratulated me on an outstanding academic record, and offered a twelve-month tenure with full payment of tuition and fees, including a monthly stipend.  This award opened opportunities already in my pursuit of an MPH degree, including opportunities for research in tuberculosis control at Columbus Public Health this fall., Habitat for Humanity of Columbus It is a pleasure to work along side other volunteers from Habitat for Humanity to create homes for individuals who would otherwise be unable to afford one.  Working on the construction support crew, I follow directions to ensure that all the construction sites in the Columbus area have the materials and tools necessary to complete their tasks for the day.  Lifting, moving, and organizing materials, in addition to assisting crews when needed are common aspects of the job.  I love to help others in need, and this provides a personal way to help a family and serve the community., Suite Host for the Dayton Dragons Professional Baseball Team This is currently my seventh year as a member of the customer service staff for the Dayton Dragons Professional Baseball Team.  I assist in providing the most comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere possible for guests of the Dayton Dragons in their team luxury suite.  I consistently have interaction with elected officials, high ranking military, celebrities, CEOs, and other VIPs.  Greeting, serving, and happily accommodating guests are my top priorities.  In 2004 the Dayton Dragons honored me as a Most Valuable Employee., Family Resource Center Volunteer Two hours each Friday during the first semester of my senior year, I volunteered at the Family Resource Center in Oxford, OH.  This non-profit organization, run mostly by volunteers and donations, allowed me the opportunity to help the community in many ways.  Whether it was helping stock the food pantry, organize donated clothing or toys, or cleaning up the facilities, the work was personally satisfying.  I became close with the staff as well as several of the families we served.  The work was rewarding and I only wish I could have donated more time and effort."

    "text": "Having attended one of the largest universities in the country, I have come to realize two significant features of big schools. The first is that feelings of anonymity and loss of personal identity are difficult to avoid. I remember hearing multiple warnings such as, Don't let yourself become just a number, but I could never imagine how that would really feel. The second realization fortunately helps alleviate the concerns of the first. Being at a school with a large population and tremendous resources allows one to do almost anything one desires.   Early on in my college career I knew that I would challenge myself to become a physician. I also decided I would take advantage of every opportunity and make my path as broad and uniquely mine as possible. I chose pre-medicine physics as my major because I knew it would be challenging and because I wanted to dedicate part of my life to a field that has so many unanswered questions. My years spent studying optics and light-matter interactions in Dr. Van Woerkom's lab gave me great satisfaction. During my last year, I knew I was truly immersed in my discipline when I found myself in a small discussion with four of the most important contributors to the field of Above-Threshold Ionization. Chances are my knowledge and experiences in physics will only help my medical education in limited or indirect ways. Nevertheless, I chose a physics job opportunity over one at a hospital my freshman year, and at no point have I ever regretted that choice.   Occasionally I have wondered why I rarely met pre-medicine students. I believe the reason is my preparation for medical school has been as unique as it has been beneficial. I have had many enjoyable and enriching experiences such as studying Spanish in Mexico, playing rugby and water polo, and attending political events with my friends in groups such as the Committee for Justice in Palestine. While searching for productive pre-med activities, I found a few very important organizations. I chose to volunteer with Big Brothers Big Sisters, and was matched with a first-generation Mexican-American high school boy. He was dealing with some rough situations at the time, and I have done my best to help him think positively about his life.  In return, he has taught me much about Mexican culture in Columbus, Ohio. I was able to devote time to many community services through our physics honor society and Club Hispano. I helped lead these organizations as a senior, and because of that my last year was more memorable and meaningful to me than any other. I have had very worthwhile clinical experiences working on medical mission trips in Central America. Now, I spend Monday evenings translating at the local Physicians Free Clinic. This allows me to sit in with many different physicians and make connections with a few patients each evening.    Since the last round of applications, I have taken time away from school.  My main reason for doing this was to work as a volunteer in Lima, Peru.  I was there for three months at two medical posts.  I had no idea what to expect to be doing; that question was answered on my first day at one of the posts.  Still accompanied by members of the Peruvian host organization, I had my hands on a man with two serious traumas.  That was not to be the most exciting day of my placement.  In addition to the daily traumas and dog bites, I learned how to suture and even took a patient to the hospital in an incredibly crude ambulance.  At the same time I improved my Spanish speaking and became good friends with the doctors and nurses at the posts.  I came home in April and am working off the expenses for that trip, as an EMT and at another job as a Spanish interpreter.    All things considered, rarely running into other pre-med students could be a good sign -- a sign that I have found an alternate route. Problem solving often presents various solutions, and exploring every solution has been and will always be my first step. There are probably not as many career path options in medical school as I had in college, but I understand that the medical field moves quickly and in order to keep up, one must stay close to colleagues and peers. I look forward to tackling the challenge of becoming a physician. I will know I have succeeded when I have expert knowledge and when I know my patients on a personal level. OSU Physics Department Research Assistant As a research assistant, I had many different tasks.  Some of them included creating software for use in our experiments, others were performing the actual experiments themselves.  I learned more here about experimental techniques than in any lab class.  It was also a great opportunity to work with graduate students and many professors in physics and chemistry., Club Hispano As Vice-President, I helped our club plan and participate in many community services.  We were closely involved with Big Brothers Big Sisters, as well as the American Red Cross.  I also started and maintained our group website., EMT Employed as EMT-Basic for a private ambulance company in Columbus.  Our work consists of transports between facilities, with occasional emergencies.  I work with other basics as well as paramedics providing Advanced Life Support., Denman Undergraduate Research Forum I presented a poster on my research dealing with producing ultra-short laser pulses.  My work was presented to several people including three judges, who were faculty members of related departments.  They gave very helpful feedback on my presentation., Smith Undergraduate Research Scholarship I received this award, given to a couple undergraduates once a year for outstanding research., Center for Talented Youth I served as a teaching assistant for the Fast-Paced High School Physics course.  My duties included assisting with class lectures, activities, and grading.  The students were mostly high school underclassmen.  This was my first teaching experience with multiple students, and I learned a lot about the teaching process and received valuable feedback from everyone in the program., Nuevo Progresso Mission Trip I spent 4 days in Nuevo Progresso, Mexico, with a team of physicians and nurses.  I served as a translator for each of the 3 open clinics we provided., OSU Medical Center volunteer I spent several quarters at the university medical center working in various departments.  The volunteer program was decent, allowing a limited amount of patient interaction and contact with nurses and physicians., Hands to Honduras I was able to help on this mission trip by checking patients in and distributing vitamins and toothbrushes.  We held 6 open clinics in 8 days, travelling from the north coast of the country to the capital, Tegucigalpa., OSU College of Arts & Sciences Research Scholarship I was awarded this scholarship for my senior thesis proposal on photo-ionization measurements of magnesium.  (The project was subsequently changed by myself and my advisor), Big Brothers Big Sisters I was involved as a mentor to a young Mexican man.  We hung out together a couple times a month and spoke on the phone frequently.  I've learned a lot about the issues their family faces, being from another culture.  They spoke only Spanish at home, yet they would practice their English with me when I visited., Denman Undergraduate Research Forum In my second entry in the forum, I presented a poster describing my research on improving techniques for measuring photo-ionization yields., Sigma Pi Sigma - Physics Honorary Our organization participated in numerous outreach activities around the Greater Columbus area.  These were typically physics demo shows for kids.  I served as Treasurer for the organization., Volunteer Peru Placed in two medical posts and one therapeutic school for children with neurological disorders.  I volunteered in patient care at the medical posts and became familiar with the medical practices, health issues, staff, and patients at these locations.  My duties varied from taking vital signs and cleaning wounds to administering injections and learning to suture.  At the school I assisted once a week with the physical therapy and social activities with the children.  Throughout the program I stayed with a Peruvian family and have improved my Spanish speaking substantially., Physicians Free Clinic volunteer The Physicians Free Clinic is a volunteer organization that offers free medical services to anyone.  I am involved as a translator, which allows me to sit in with physicians as well as practice my Spanish."

    "text": "Medicine is overrated. Why don't you find a rich man to marry and have kids already Women don't need careers. Education is a waste of money. What is there to respect about doctors They charge $100 to tell you to take a nap. Given that these are the opinions of much of my family, I don't know what I find so enthralling about the field of medicine. I don't come from a medically pedigreed family. My parents are an accountant, a computer engineer, a press worker, and a temp worker. I can't tell you why I belong in medicine, but I can tell you without a doubt that I am meant to be a physician. I hesitate to use a clich, but medicine is my calling.  I've worked since I was fifteen years old in many fruitless jobs such as housekeeping at Holiday Inn, retail at JC Penney, and serving pizzas at Pizza Hut. In addition to paying my bills and school fees, these jobs have molded my strong work ethic. My first work experience in the medical field was as a veterinary assistant during my senior year of high school. I have maintained that position for almost seven years and through three clinics now and I continue to work in the veterinary field because of the myriad opportunities it offers. Due to less stringent confidentiality regulations and a more relaxed atmosphere, I am able to undertake more responsibility and perform more complex tasks as a veterinary assistant than I would be able to do in a comparable position in human medicine. I am very proud of my current position at Best Friends Animal Clinic. Dr. Suzanne Paroff recruited me when she began her own practice, and as one of only three employees my responsibilities are varied and exciting. I most enjoy client education and running lab work. Perhaps the most fulfilling job I've had, though, was at the Kent State University Health Center where I worked as a laboratory assistant, nursing assistant in the Women's Clinic, and medical records technician. It was extremely satisfying and rewarding to assist and provide care to fellow students.\t My love for medicine was fully realized this year when I matriculated at the University of Cincinnati as a graduate student in Cellular and Molecular Physiology. Two of the required courses were offered through the College of Medicine alongside the first year medical students. I have never before felt so strongly that I was where I belonged and doing what I was meant to do. My only strong frustration (besides memorizing biochemical pathways) was that I was not enrolled in the rest of the first year courses.  Though I highly enjoyed graduate school, it was a very difficult year. My grandmother was diagnosed with colon cancer and given a very poor prognosis just before Christmas. My father filed for divorce from his third wife and remarried three months later. This created a significant hardship because I have three half-siblings from his third marriage that my sister and I have been instrumental in bringing up. My responsibilities to them created difficulties throughout my undergraduate career as well. The immediate result of his most recent divorce was that I had to make the four and a half hour commute between Cleveland and Cincinnati each week so that I could continue to care for the kids on the weekend when they were out of school and attend school myself during the week. Additionally, I had to serve pizzas on the weekends so I could pay for gasoline to make the commute. Luckily I am great at multi-tasking, so it was easy for me to study at work between tables and when business was slow. I became discouraged at one point during the fall quarter after earning a low score in biochemistry. A classmate confided that I had scored higher than her and that she was impressed that I was doing so well while contending with so many problems outside of school. Another colleague seconded the opinion and applauded my resilience of character. Their remarks made a strong impression on me because they allowed me to step back and realize that while my grades might not be perfect, they don't tell my whole story. They say nothing about my ability to persevere and succeed at my goals. When I consider all of the tasks and responsibilities I undertake in addition to school, I am proud of my accomplishments. A great description of what it takes to succeed in medicine was printed in Discover magazine in January, 2006 (Vital Signs, Vol 27, No. 1). H. Lee Kagan said that it's about a curiosity that, when coupled with persistence, will do more to unravel a diagnostic conundrum than even the most expensive stethoscope. Add to that resilience, determination, compassion, and an intense passion for medicine to understand why I will be an amazing, proficient, and respected physician. Alpha Lambda Delta National Freshman Honors Society Alpha Lambda Delta is a National Honor Society. Membership is offered to freshmen who achieve a high academic standard. The organization promotes community service and academic excellence. Projects our chapter worked on during the 2002-2003 year included fund raising for the local Big Brothers Big Sisters organization, volunteering for the Earth Day Coalition of Cleveland,  making holiday cards and decorations for a local nursing home, organizing a winter clothing drive for Head Start, and planning a canned food drive for local charities. I had the honor of taking a leading role in the organization and served as Vice President for the fall semester of 2002 and President for the spring of 2003. Additional responsibilities included conducting meetings, organizing volunteer opportunities, assisting our advisor with new membership invitations, and coordinating an initiation ceremony. As an officer, I had the opportunity to attend the Alpha Lambda Delta 2002 Leadership/Activity Workshop in Indianapolis, Indiana . Topics included chapter programming, member recruitment, fundraising, and community service project ideas. I was honored to enjoy a second year in the organization as a Junior Advisor. I assisted the new leaders to complete necessary paperwork and establish local contacts., Student Nursing Assistant/ Lab Technician As a student nursing assistant, I worked in various departments in the school health center. I pulled and filed charts, made copies, and sent faxes in the medical records department.  While working in the women's clinic, I was responsible for taking vitals, preparing tests to be sent to an outside lab, and running pregnancy tests and urinalyses.  I also worked in the laboratory, which was my favorite department. It was here that I learned phlebotomy on humans (I had previous experience with cats and dogs), prepared samples for transport to an outside laboratory. I also gained experience with in-house tests including Mono, Strep, and Cholestech, and routinely performed throat swabs and finger sticks., Pet- and House-sitting As a veterinary assistant, I took note that many animals seem to be brought to the vet shortly after being boarded in a kennel while their owners are out of town. Often the stress of the situation is sufficient to suppress the animal's immune system. This, along with the exposure to unfamiliar animals while in a kennel often leads to an illness for the owners to take care of once they return.  I began pet sitting because it seemed a simple solution to this problem. By checking in on the pets a few times a day, feeding them, and often staying the night with them, owners are able to enjoy their trip knowing that their children are well taken care of in their normal surroundings.  I have been pet sitting since my freshman year of college. My clients are referred to me through the animal hospital and by word of mouth. I sit many pets regularly, and have grown close to them and their families. I like to think that I'm able to provide some comfort to those anxious about leaving their pets behind., Animal Caretaker - Psychology Research Lab As an animal caretaker in the psychology research lab, I was one of four student workers in charge of caring for approximately 1500 rats. Job responsibilities included feeding, watering, changing litter, cleaning cages and racks, keeping an eye on the overall health of each individual rat, and overseeing the breeding process. I was also happy to complete any odd-jobs that the graduate researchers asked of me to assist completion of their projects, such as drilling air holes in new housing units., Veterinary Assistant I began working at Stow Kent Animal Hospital during my senior year in high school. I was trained in all positions in the hospital including veterinary assistant, receptionist, phone technician, and surgical assistant. By working in a variety of departments I have had the opportunity to assist doctors with client education, restrain animals, take patient histories, administer injections, utilize Avimark, and prepare patients for surgery. I am comfortable performing venipuncture on cats and dogs and have experience inserting endotracheal tubes.  By working in a veterinary setting I have had many opportunities to regularly perform procedures that would not be available to me in the human health setting in an entry-level position. I now teach many of these procedures to new employees. This job has been a fantastic step into the medical community., Student Research Assistant I spent a semester assisting Bryan Anderson with preliminary data collection for his Master's thesis. My role in the project was to encourage parents to fill out questionaires during their visits to Children's Hospital Physician Associates (CHPA) clinics in the surrounding area. The information gathered by these surveys would then determine at which locations Bryan would institute the Triple P - Positive Parenting Program, which is the basis of his graduate work.  I really enjoyed this experience because the Kent State University Psychology Department was working in tandem with Akron Children's Hospital, which provided me a unique opportunity to interact with children while their parents were involved with our survey.  In addition to my training as a research assistant, I was trained to be a Reading Rover. At each CHPA site, a selection of books was provided for Reading Rovers to read with children. This served the dual purposes of encouraging parents to concentrate on their questionaires and allowing us to interact with children, which made our job fun!, Dean's List Students earning a GPA of 3.4 or higher are awarded with inclusion on the Dean's List. I earned this distinction for the following semesters: Fall 2000, Spring 2001, Fall 2001, Spring 2002, Summer 2002, Fall 2003, Spring 2004, and Summer 2004., Mini Med School - Case Western Reserve University The Case Western Reserve University Mini Med School is a community oriented continuing education opportunity. Twice a year the medical school opens its doors to the outside and invites lecturers from the faculty to address the laymen audience. The goal is to educate the community about current medical issues.  I attended this conference during the spring of 2002. I was impressed by the comprehensiveness of the lectures, and the topics presented strongly appealed to me. Two lectures were particularly memorable. Dr. Martin I. Resnick, Chairman of Urology, and Dr. Michael G. Oefelein co-presented a lecture entitled Urology: Male Cancer which covered prostate cancer and bladder cancer. The lesson I took home was in the presentation, symptoms, and treatment of the diseases.  Another lecture was provided by Dr. John H. Nilson and Dr. J. Ricardo Loret De Mola entitled Reproductive Biology: Infertility. Factors of infertility were taught, including polycystic ovarian syndrome and an endocrinological discussion that later helped me with an informational search while preparing an undergraduate research project. Schedule permitting, I plan to attend the Fall 2005 session., ISLP Delegation on Medicine to South Africa The International Scholar Laureate Program Delegation on Medicine to South Africa was the most phenomenal experience of my college career. During the last two weeks in May, 2005, eighty students selected from throughout the United States attended the delegation to South Africa where we studied the South African health care system, specifically addressing the AIDS crisis. Incredibly, in many of the areas we visited the HIV prevalence was nearly forty percent. Even more astounding was the cultural reaction to the disease, which included a great deal of denial. We attended lectures by professors and doctors at medical schools including the University of Witwatersrand and the Nelson Mandela Medical School, which covered such topics as epidemiology, forensic pathology, and the impact of AIDS on individuals and communities. Perhaps most inspiring were the visits to orphanages, hospitals, and primary care offices where we interacted closely with those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS., Mortar Board The Laurels Chapter of Mortar Board at Kent State University is a senior national honor society. Members are selected based on their academic record, distinguished leadership, and dedicated service. Mortar Board is extremely active in the community. Activities this year included leaf raking for the elderly, Thanksgiving baskets, Angel Tree, Christmas nursing home visits, tutoring at the King Kennedy Center, and Relay for Life. Additionally we did fund raising in the form of car washes and a bowl-a-thon., Acceptance to the National Dean's List The National Dean's List is a nationwide publication that recognizes gifted students. All selected students must be nominated by a dean or faculty member from their institution. Requirements include having a B+ or higher GPA or being in the top 10th percentile of the class. Only one percent of university students in the nation are nominated each year. I was honored to receive this distinction for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 award years., UMEB - Independent Undergraduate Research Experience The Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB) program was initiated at Kent State University in 2004 to provide an opportunity to undergraduate students wishing to gain experience in laboratory research. The program was designed with a co-disciplinary model in mind, requiring the student to integrate environmental biology with a field of their choosing.  Funded by the National Science Foundation, students designed and conducted an independent research project with the aid of two faculty advisors. Dr. Jennifer Marcinkiewicz, a physiologist, and Dr. Todd Royer, an environmental biologist, co-mentored me. We examined the effects of benzo(a)pyrene on ovarian development and function in the juvenile fathead minnow. Though ultimately too many errors contaminated the project to achieve meaningful results, I benefited enormously from the practical experience I gained, including fish husbandry, tissue processing and histology, and data collection and presentation. This work is the foundation of the honors thesis project that I will undertake this fall., Waitress Waitressing is hard work! I enjoy interacting with customers and learning the many facets of running a successful business., Veterinary assistant When Suzanne Paroff purchased her practice, the Best Friends Animal Clinic, she asked me to join the team. The practice is still very small, so I handle every aspect of it from reception to surgery assistance. I have really enjoyed watching the start-up of a new business. Additionally, in this clinic I am permitted more personal contact time with clients, which I find extremely satisfying."

    "text": "When I was fifteen, I was named Miss Ohio Teen USA 1999. Wearing a tiara for a night was great fun, but using the experience to promote the March of Dimes at their annual WalkAmerica was far more satisfying. I was nervous standing in front of hundreds of participants, explaining the importance of folic acid for unborn babies, however I challenged myself and overcame my fears. This experience and others in high school, such as fundraising for the Deaconess Foundation and assisting with the Senior Olympics, allowed me to grow into a mature and independent young woman and helped me discover I am most fulfilled when serving others.  To gain experience dealing directly with patients as a college student, I volunteered to act as a liaison between the physician and patient at the Greenville Free Medical Clinic (GFMC) during my last two years at Furman University. I was expected to obtain facts, yet I took this opportunity to go beyond what was required. Many patients entered the clinic uncomfortable and nervous about disclosing personal information to a complete stranger. To me it was important to respect every individual and make their experience at the clinic as pleasant as possible. I worked with a variety of individuals: a 50-year old man, a young Hispanic mother, a recovering drug addict. I realized that under different circumstances I could be in their situations, without money or medical coverage, so it was important to me to treat each individual with kindness and fairness. I greeted each patient with a warm smile and friendly words, offering comfort and assurance and, hopefully, making them feel more at ease. I realized that by choosing to be a sensitive, active listener and gaining the trust of patients, I was assisting in their healing process. I know that much can be accomplished through listening, especially when it is combined with the skills of a caring physician. Empathizing with the patients' struggles, I realized the important responsibility of physicians to reach out to medically underserved populations. As a future physician, I will be committed to serving and educating such communities.  This year, while studying to obtain a Master's degree in Biological Science at Drexel University College of Medicine to strengthen my academic credentials for medical school, I also continued my volunteer work serving those in need. At the People's Emergency Center (PEC) in inner city Philadelphia, I was initially apprehensive whether I would be accepted by the homeless women and children the center provides services to, but to my surprise I was very welcomed. Whether I was helping my favorite friend, 6-year old Quamir, learn to read or assisting a 16-year old mother of two, Erica, learn basic computer skills, mutual respect and trust developed as we met on common ground despite the completely different worlds we lived in. These experiences at the PEC and the GFMC have contributed to my determination and passion to enter the medical field and continue serving those most in need.  My concern for compassionate treatment is balanced by my intense interest in scientific research. During my junior and senior years, although not required, I chose to augment my studies in biology with an independent research project. I spent approximately 600 hours over the course of 15 months in the lab, plus extra time reviewing primary literature. Although my research, designed to determine how serine proteases affect the size and shape of neuronal axon development initially proved unsuccessful, and I was disappointed, I was driven to continue. I loved uncovering new knowledge and the possibility of solving one piece of a much larger puzzle in neurodegenerative disease research. Resuming my work, I became the only student researcher on a project designed to determine protease-activated receptor expression in the developing chick spinal cord during programmed cell death. Not only were the results of this research significant, but also valuable to me because someday my contribution may impact people like Chelsa, a friend with Alzheimer's disease or Chris, a young father with a severe spinal cord injury. The publication of this paper is still in progress for submission to the journal Neuron.  My desire to gain clinical experience observing the responsibilities of physicians prompted me to take on a second project, an applied study, in order to gain my first exposure to surgery. The experience was invaluable; I chose to shadow the entire shift of several physicians. Following my full day with a physician, I returned home to research terms and conditions that I was unfamiliar with, using this information to compile a 200-page reference book for my own self-study. These experiences confirmed my desire to become a physician and reinforced my determination to solve each patient's specific problem no matter how much analysis and conferring is required for accurate diagnosis and treatment. As a physician, I hope to comfort my patients and to be involved in continuous intellectual exploration in order to solve medical problems. I understand that hard work, long hours, and determination yield tremendous emotional satisfaction and fulfillment, and I look forward to using my own talents and knowledge for the benefit of othe Historian Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) is the national premedical honor society.  As the Historian, my responsibilities included maintaining an updated summary of all chapter activities and programs for the Biennial Chapter Report.  My duties involved writing, assembling, and submitting the Biennial Chapter Report to the National Convention as well as working with the Vice-President in maintaining the chapter scrapbook and other historical records.  I displayed the chapter charter and awards at appropriate times and in appropriate areas, especially at the Initiation Ceremony.  As both a member and a leader in Alpha Epsilon Delta, I was able to interact with other premedical students at Furman University and participate in events of common interest.  I enjoyed listening to speakers sponsored by AED discussing medically related topics and I enjoyed participating in community service opportunities organized by AED.  My favorite community service activity through AED was volunteering at the Greenville Hospital System Children's Hospital, spending Saturday mornings providing entertainment to the children at the hospital., Philanthropy Chair As a member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority with the position of Philanthropy Chair, my duties involved organizing both national and local philanthropy projects such as the Ronald McDonald House, Greenville YWCA, Relay for Life, and many others.  As the Philanthropy Chair, I coordinated fundraising events for the local Greenville Ronald McDonald House as well as the Alpha Delta Pi Foundation which provides opportunities that benefit Alpha Delta Pi and its members and other individuals in the community.  Also, I both led and coordinated events and visits to all volunteer projects for members of the sorority.  As the Philanthropy Chair, I was able to develop my leadership skills and further understand various philanthropic endeavors on both the community and national levels., Volunteer As a volunteer in The Christ Hospital Emergency Room, I assisted with cleaning and maintaining patient rooms, transporting patients, and delivering laboratory materials.  I spent a considerable amount of time interacting with patients and their families.  Also, because the staff became aware of my strong interest in medicine, I spent much time observing physician-patient interactions and the various medical procedures taking place in the emergency room., Member Beta Chi was first introduced to Furman University during the fall of 2003, during which I obtained membership.  The purpose of this organization is to expand student knowledge, stimulate independent interest in the life sciences, enhance the program of the Biology Department, and establish a forum for the expression of student ideas within the realm of the biological sciences at Furman University.  Membership in this honor society was beneficial because it allowed me to interact with other members with a strong interest in biology outside of the classroom setting.  As a member of Beta Chi, I participated in group community service projects, fundraisers, and lectures by speakers brought to Furman University by Beta Chi.  Additionally, I was nominated for the National Collegiate Natural Sciences Award by Dr. A.J. Pollard, Ph.D. due to my commitment to academic excellence., Student Representative Furman's Finest is an organization of Furman students welcoming prospective Furman students and athletes to the campus.  We spent the day with the prospective student and their family providing information about the campus, student life, academics, and extracurricular activities.  As a Furman's Finest representative, I provided a real-life account of life at Furman University., Mentor Mentoring two elementary age children at Alexander Elementary in Greenville, SC was an enlightening and positive experience.  Visiting with my little brother or little sister at least once a week at their school provided a supportive and stable relationship for these children who came from disadvantaged and unstable families.  My responsibilities included tutoring the student, assisting with homework, reading books, playing games and simply providing attention, companionship, and friendship., Volunteer People's Emergency Center provides homeless women and children with a variety of services in order for them to escape the cycle of homelessness.  The center provides families with case management, emergency shelter, food and clothing, transitional housing, child care and health care services, specialized after school and summer enrichment programs, mental health services, parent education, welfare-to-work services, and housing counseling.  I am specifically involved with the after school and evening educational programs for the children and adults.  I tutor students in reading and math and assist with computer help sessions.  Volunteering at the People's Emergency Center has provided me with an invaluable understanding of homelessness and the numerous issues facing homeless mothers and their children.  Through my visits, I have developed personal relationships with several children and their mothers.  Racial and socioeconomic barriers were broken and I have learned a lot from the children and mothers I encounter.  Furthermore, this experience has reinforced my belief in the need for physicians to serve their community in less traditional ways., Member Phi Eta Sigma is a national honor society where eligible members are inducted in their freshman year of college.  The goal of this organization is to encourage and reward academic excellence among freshman in institutions of higher learning.  Induction is recognition of personal accomplishment and serves as an incentive for continued high scholarship.  Membership provided me the opportunity to meet freshman scholars from all academic disciplines at Furman University., Mentor and Research Assistant The Forensics Mentors Institute of the Fredric Rieders Family Renaissance Foundation, founded by Dr. Fredric Rieders, Ph.D., is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering education in the field of science.  This program brings together graduate students from Drexel University College of Medicine and Arcadia University with high school students from the Philadelphia area to perform scientific research for nine weeks of the summer.  Graduate students gain valuable research, mentoring, and teaching skills, while high school students receive an introduction to scientific research and an opportunity to interact with their graduate student mentors.  Specifically, my group is researching Hydrogen Sulfide and Hydrogen Cyanide Utilizing Crown Ether Complexes by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry.  By utilizing a unique crown ether, known as Kryptofix 222B, will enable the identification and quantitation of cyanide and sulfide anions by gas chromatographic separation with mass spectral detection in blood.  We would like to learn whether this technique will identify and quantitate sulfide and cyanide anions at or below toxicologically significant levels in blood and whether this technique is reliably reproducible to be utilized as an economical and scientifically sound method to replace current methods., International Service Chair The Furman Rotaract Club is a rotary club for Furman University students. This organization provides students with the opportunity to be introduced to community service and become involved in their community.  As a group, we organized local, national, and international service projects and formed relationships with professionals and business people in our community.  As the International Service Chair, my responsibilities involved organizing an international service project for rotary club members and Furman University students.  With this leadership position, I organized an on-campus 30-Hour Famine to raise money to feed and care for children worldwide.  Through my experience with the Furman Rotaract Club and as International Philanthropy Chair, I learned about issues facing my community, nation, and world.  The 30-Hour Famine gave me the opportunity to more fully understand global hunger and poverty that is a leading contributor to preventable deadly diseases across the globe., Team Leader The goal of Relay for Life is to raise money for cancer research and awareness.  I have been involved with and a team leader for the Relay for Life during both my high school and college years.  Brought to Furman University in the spring of 2001, the Relay for Life remains a huge success drawing participants from the Greenville community as well as Furman University faculty and students.  As a team, we set goals and raised money for cancer.  Every spring, this event provided me with new hope in the fight against cancer as hundreds of people united for a common cause., Volunteer The Greenville Humane Society operates a full service animal shelter and clinic.  The goal of this organization is to promote and improve the quality of life in the humane treatment of animals.  As a volunteer at the shelter, my responsibilities included cleaning and maintaining the animal areas, bathing the puppies, and exercising the adult dogs. Also, I communicated with individuals and families looking to adopt a pet, providing them with information about specific animals as well as the adoption process at the Humane Society.  This experience allowed me to assist animals in need and take part in the process of placing them in a loving home., Volunteer/Project coordinator The mission of the YWCA is to unite members by creating opportunities for women's growth, leadership, and power in order to achieve peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all people.  As a volunteer and project coordinator, my responsibilities included organizing and participating in after school projects for the children at the YWCA.  I organized holiday parties for the children and spent time playing games and making crafts with the children in the after school program.  This experience allowed me to interact with children of all different ages and backgrounds and provided me with the opportunity to be a role model, friend, and companion to the children in the after school program., Volunteer The Ronald McDonald House is a home away from home for families with hospitalized children.  It is a place where families can find comfort, support, and companionship during difficult times when their child is receiving treatment at the hospital.  I spent considerable time raising funds to support this home by organizing an annual barbeque and car wash.  Also, I assisted by cleaning the house, cooking meals, and making decorations or gifts for the families and their children.  This experience was beneficial because it allowed me to interact with the families and staff of the Ronald McDonald house and gain a glimpse of the hardships involved with having a hospitalized and often terminally ill child.  I contributed by providing comfort and support to these families by supporting the Ronald McDonald House and participating in the services that the staff and volunteers offer., Intern Under the supervision of Mrs. April Stegman, this internship with the Senior Services Department of Deaconess Hospital provided me the opportunity to learn and become involved with Elderlife, Lifeline, and the Deaconess Hospital Resource Center.  I researched and developed resources to benefit and educate the senior citizen patrons of the hospital.  I developed information about Medicare and Medicaid programs as well as various informative materials on elderly health issues and disease states.  Through this experience, I was able to educate myself about these programs and the myriad of issues facing our senior population.  Also, I was given the opportunity to shadow physicians in the Psychiatric Unit at Deaconess Hospital.  I had daily interaction with individuals visiting the hospital, patients of the hospital, and the hospital staff.  Overall, this experience provided me a greater understanding of various aspects in senior healthcare."

    "text": "After scouring the country, searching far and wide for my life's calling, my travels have finally led me back to where I began, medicine. My neo-pilgrimage across America was necessary for me to pinpoint my perfect profession. During my travels I explored a wide array of vocations and locations: a spinal cord injury clinical research lab at the University of Kentucky, a landscaping business in rural KY, a camp counselor on the Cumberland Plateau, a waiter at a Texas roadhouse, and a volunteer forest ranger in Northern Utah. Despite my wide array of activities it was during my time in Utah when I realized that medicine was my calling. Medicine was my primary interest as a child. Unlike my friends, who dreaded going to see the doctor, I couldn't get there fast enough. It was simply amazing to watch the physician utilize his numerous instruments so craftily. It also intrigued me how they always seemed to know precisely how to cure my ailments. I wanted to be that person; I wanted to be the one whom others sought to fix their problems, the person with all the tools and answers to make everything better. In high school however, I discovered other career interests and my desire for medicine started to fade. Arriving at my undergrad institution in rural Tennessee was a huge breath of fresh air. My interests were allowed to expand beyond those of high school and many doors opened. I was first met with a multitude of outdoor activities, all of which seemed to beckon me. Thus, I indulged. Trail running, mountain biking, climbing, swimming, caving, I participated in everything that I could. My education, inside and outside of the classroom, was greatly influenced by my newly discovered love for the outdoors. In order to learn more about plants and in the consideration of landscape design as a possible career, I spent the summer following my freshman year working for a landscaper. I still maintained my pre-med requirements to keep my options open, but they took a backseat to my environmental pursuits. The next academic year I continued to pursue my pre-med, chemistry, and environmental education interests by taking the necessary classes. Due to the wide scope of school work and the extracurricular activities that took up even more of my already-stretched time, my GPA began to suffer. I had no distinct long-term focus. Everything seemed blurry in regards to what I wanted to do with my life. As a result I blindly applied and was accepted to work for the Student Conservation Association, which placed me in a volunteer position in Utah for the summer. During the first few weeks, I felt certain that I had found my dream job. My days were spent removing fallen trees from the trails, patrolling for fire pits and meeting a wide variety of people. Around the middle of the summer though, the days started to drag, and I grew too tired to enjoy the incessant hiking. I began to realize that even though I really enjoy the outdoors, I physically and mentally could not work in that kind of an environment for the rest of my life. This notion finally became a reality one night during the summer, when I called my advisor and asked, What is it going to take for me to get into medical school With my childhood interests rekindled, I began to focus on making them a reality. By this time, with a below-average GPA, the slow re-prioritization of my life began. With a goal in sight, I learned to work harder within my studies while trimming some of my extracurricular activities. During this process, I also questioned why medicine is the career path that I chose. The childhood answers where still there, yet new reasons began to appear. All of my previous jobs placed me in the public eye. I greatly enjoyed working with the public and I wanted to continue this theme. However, when I worked outside of the medical field I was never fully satisfied with my duties. I wanted more and with medicine I found that I took more pride in my trade. After my summer in Utah, it was suggested that I should participate in another medical internship. The next year, I found myself in Cincinnati working Dr. Robert Baughman in his clinic. Out of the large number of jobs that I have held, this was by far the most enjoyable. I would meet with patients, administer standardized protocols, analyze the data, and schedule appointments. The quick paced atmosphere and the sheer amount of thought that went into the work was exhilarating. At the end of the summer, I was sad to return undergrad but I knew that I had too because I wanted more, I wanted to go to medical school. When my first bid for medical school admission was unsuccessful, it was time to look at my application and understand where I wasn't competitive. To strengthen my application I applied to the University of Cincinnati's Master of Physiology program and was accepted. This program provided an opportunity for me to increase my GPA in classes that were with the medical school students. I also retook the MCAT in the fall of 2006. Now on my third bid for admittance I am much more focused and mature about my choices. By successfully trimming down my large list of possible careers to one field, I can fully concentrate on my long term goals. Pulmonary Research Publication A paper was recently published from the research that I completed at the University of Cincinnati under Dr. Robert Baughman.    Baughman et al. Six-minute walk test and health status assessment in sarcoidosis. Chest 2007 Jul; 132(1):207-13, BACCHUS BACCHUS stands for Boost Alcohol Consciousness Concerning the Health of the University Students.  My job consisted of taking a training course to learn how to drive a 15 passenger van and then driving that van from 9pm to 2am on Friday or Saturday nights to keep inebriated students from driving around campus.  Students would call from various locations on campus and would ask to be taken to a party or home.  It was a great experience in learning how to handle many different personality types in an enclosed space., Pulmonary Research at the University of Cincinnati Dr. Baughman, my employer, is very interested in a rare autoimmune disease called Sarcoidosis. He performs clinical research at the University of Cincinnati on this disease.  I worked with him for the summer scheduling appointments, administering protocol testing, and analyzing data from Sarcoidosis patients. A typical day for me would involve calling in a patient, subjecting them to a series of questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, and a 6 minute walk to try to determine their level of dyspnea or breathlessness. I also organized and analyzed the data with statistical software to determine the trends in the data under the guidance of Dr. Baughman. This experience was very important me since it has helped to reaffirm my interest in medicine. By scheduling and meeting with patients individually I feel like I received real world experience and caught a glimpse into what the life of a physician is like. I was also able to view a few bronchoscopies and clinical visits with patients. During the summer of 2006 I traveled to San Diego to present my research in front of several physicians at the annual American Thoracic Society meeting. At this time I gave a two-minute oral presentation using a relevant poster. The presentation has since expanded into a paper and was recently accepted by the journal Chest., Sewanee Animal Rescue League - no kill animal shelter Every Sunday morning I would go to the local farm to care for the dogs that we sheltered there.  My duties consisted of letting the dogs run in a field, playing with them, scooping poop, feeding and watering the animals and finally herding them back into their respective cages.  We typically had around thirty animals at the facility that we would care for.  I always enjoyed my work knowing that the end goal was to place the animals in permanent homes instead of euthanizing the animals., MS-150 Every year the Mid South Chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society holds a charitable bike event called the Bike to Jack and Back.  We, the Sewanee cycling team, started in Nashville and cycled 75 miles to the Jack Daniels distillery in Lynchburg, TN and then the next morning we rode another 75 miles back to the start.  I helped to organize and lead the training rides for our team throughout the fall.  This activity was an extension of my Sewanee Mountain Bike Team responsibilities., Volunteer Forest Service Ranger For the summer of 2004 I roamed the wilds of the Uinta mountain range in Northeastern Utah looking for illegal fire pits and downed trees that blocked the trails.  I cleaned the fire pits and cleared the trees to keep the wilderness accessible to foot and horse traffic.  I would typically spend five to six days in the backcountry, camping and patrolling by myself or with one other person.  On weeks when I was in the front country I would day trip into more highly used areas and talk to people about proper usage of the wilderness.  I also participated in volunteer road cleanups of garbage and removal of invasive plant species., American Chemical Society / Treasurer I worked as the treasurer for the American Chemical Society's Sewanee Chapter.  My job included obtaining money for the club by stating our purposes to the school and asking for money based upon our usage.  I also maintained our records and watched how our money was spent.  I stepped down after one year's service, because of time constraints placed upon me by my classes and other extracurricular activities, Environmental Resident Program Recently Environmentalism has made a resurgence at Sewanee.  Part of this movement has been captured in the Environmental Resident program.  This volunteer program worked to raise awareness of political and social aspects of environmentalism that included issues on the national scale as well as the local.  Personally, I took out the weekly recycling, helped out with glass recycling and I started an initiative to put high efficiency washing and drying machines in the dorms.  I also helped lobby for waterless urinals on campus.  Both the washing machines and waterless urinals have been implemented on campus and have greatly reduced Sewanee's water and energy consumption., Bridge Program Counselor This camp pooled together twenty high school minority students from across the country who were interested in attending Sewanee for their undergrad careers.  My duties included tutoring them in physics and web page design, constructing useful activities for them outside of class, life-guarding them while they swam, and working to keep the peace between everyone.  This is one of the best experiences that I have ever had with people.  I made a lot of friends whom I still stay in touch with and I learned a lot about myself by paying attention to how I react in with various people during stressful situations., Sewanee Mountain Bike Team Throughout my undergrad career at Sewanee, I mountain biked there.  After my freshman year, I was part of a group of individuals that started an official mountain bike team.  We went to races, biked and trained together.  As one of the founding members I had a wide variety of responsibilities.  These included arranging transport for the bikes and racers, maintaining our equipment, registering race participants, and presiding over the club finances.  I had to learn a lot about how to stay organized so that I could maintain an active cycling group.  The bike team was not just something that I enjoyed while I was participating though.  I continue to be an avid biker and I hope to remain one for the extent of my life.  I have the bike team to thank for helping me to become a better biker and to maintain my interest in the sport., Varsity Track Team While at Sewanee, I ran varsity track.  I hold the two conference champion titles in the 400m, and as of the present date, six school records for various events.  Track helped to shape me mentally by resetting what I thought were limits in my capacity to push myself.  It also gave me great experience in a leadership position since I was selected team captain for two years in a row by my teammates.  Also, by balancing school and athletics, I learned to better manage my time, especially during my final two years of undergrad., Spinal Cord Injury Research at the University of Kentucky While at the University of Kentucky, I worked with Dr. David Gator in the spinal cord injury research lab at the athletic center. I shadowed and sometimes participated in athletic research protocols that compared spinal cord injured populations and able bodied populations.  These patients were subjected to body fat measurements and stress tests in which VO2 max values where obtained.  The data was compiled and compared with the end goal of the study to validate the hypothesis that regular exercise in spinal cord injured patients will decrease the likelihood that those patients will develop diabetes.  By working with this research team I learned that the field of medicine was extremely interesting to me.  I thoroughly enjoyed working side-by-side with the researchers and I especially liked meeting with the patients.  This was my first major exposure to medicine and was an excellent learning opportunity., Cardiothoracic Surgery Teaching Lectures While in Cincinnati, working to complete my Master's of Science degree in Physiology, I began attending teaching lectures in the cardiothoracic surgery department at University Hospital.  The lectures typically run about an hour in length and cover many aspects of cardiothoracic surgery.  Topics have included recent primary research paper reviews, mesothelioma, cardiac artery bypass surgery versus stinting of arteries, 4D scan technologies, patient perfusion and many other topics.  The experience has really given me an excellent view into the university side of medicine and has actually made surgery a top career choice of mine."

    "text": "I always thought that my extensive shadowing hours in the operation and emergency rooms provided a clear idea of a physician's daily life and that I had enough experience to judge this career.   However, my current training through the Intramural Research Training Fellowship at the National Institute of Mental Health gave me a much more concrete experience and a different type of exposure.   What I have been experiencing at the NIH is a mirror to what I want to do for a profession; however, instead of operating on experimental mice that are sacrificed, I want to provide care for patients to improve their life and make them better fit.  My research project is involved in monitoring the changes in the behavior of wild type and knockout mice.  In one part of the project I am inducing a knockout in the brain of mice which causes the deletion of certain genes, while the other part involves the rescue of knockout mice by injecting the brain with a virus containing certain missing genes in order to restore certain molecules.  The research project requires two to three hour surgeries on the brains of mice.  The operation involves anesthetizing the mouse, making an incision in the skin of the head to uncover the skull then drilling in the skull to measured locations. After the targets are identified I proceed in injecting the virus.  In the final step, I clean the sites, suture the opening and provide post operation care.  I wait till the mouse recovers consciousness and then report my operation on surgical cards.  On the following day I check the recovery conditions and read the veterinarian notes before proceeding with further experimentation.  Having shadowed several doctors in the operation rooms of the University of Cincinnati Hospital and at Duke Health Raleigh Hospital I feel that what I am doing at NIMH is sort of similar to what doctors do. An operation involving humans is much more complicated and detailed; however, I feel the overall process is comparable.  Living the routine of surgeries every morning and checking on the cases of previous operations makes me feel that I am a physician.  In this routine I can see myself in the future. Everyday I wake up excited about operating on mice; I even take the utmost care when drilling the head.  Dr. Morozov, the principal investigator I am working with, praises my operations and gives me credit for perfecting the openings in the skull.  One thing that I am not fearful of is complications. Several times during an operation I get extensive bleeding.  Keeping the mouse alive becomes an issue I have to deal with.  At other times, since there are huge vessels passing in shallow areas under the plates of the skull I have to figure out ways to avoid drilling in those areas or avoid hitting the vessels . I always think of a mouse as a human and take good care in doing surgeries and minimizing trauma.  After the mice recover from the effects of the operation I monitor their changes in behavior.  It is more like evaluating a patient for changes after treatment.     There are several other experiences in the past three years that reinforced my decision to pursue a career in medicine. Through my volunteering experience at Duke Health Raleigh Hospital, I observed six operations that left a positive impression. I even had a better opportunity at the University of Cincinnati Hospital where I shadowed several surgeons in the operation room and where I operated the Da Vinci surgical robot for few minutes.  Observing the operations and talking to the doctors as well as getting in contact with underserved populations at the Open Door Clinic provided great motivation and assurance for my career choice. On the other hand, my involvement in community service tested my ability to communicate and aid others. Working with underrepresented children through the Young Scientist Program and the Saturday Science Academy along with tutoring college students have been a clear sign of my devotion to provide care and help for others.                                           My cultural diversity will be of great contribution to the medical school and ultimately the medical field, especially that I am better prepared to deal and communicate with the various cultural groups here in the United States.  Living for seventeen years overseas in Lebanon and attending high school there helped me in getting a feel of cultural diversity. Moreover, Lebanon is a country with several socio-economic environments that house more than twelve different religions. Living in such a culture increased my understanding of diversity and the importance of accommodating different religious and cultural beliefs. Visiting different countries and now living in the United States for three years, I have experienced the similarities and differences among many cultural groups and geographical areas.   My academic and summer program achievements along with my various extracurricular activities and awards provide a great evidence of my ambition, ability, and devotion. Finally, my exposure to the clinical, surgical, and research parts of the medical field solidified my informed career decision -- becoming a physician. Peer Adviser Advising Central at NC State is designed to provide web and Internet based advising to NC State undergraduate students. As a peer adviser, I answer emailed questions and give instant support during the night for students via chatting sessions. At the beginning of each fall and spring semesters I assist Advising Central with their New Student Orientation., Habitat for Humanity and MANNA food bank For the fall break, I joined ten other undergraduates on a one-week trip to Asheville, a rural area in North Carolina. During that week, we helped in sorting grocery products at the MANNA food bank; we also cleaned the banks and parks of the Swannanoa River. On the last day of the trip, we helped at the Habitat for Humanity Warehouse. This trip was organized by the Center for Student Leadership, Ethics, and Public Service at NC State University., Red Cross Certifications I had four months of training in responding to emergencies and administering first aid. Currently I am certified for Adult, Infant, and Child CPR in addition to a certification in Responding to Emergencies and the usage of AEDs. The main reason I acquired such training is because I do not want to be at the site of a medical emergency without knowing what to do. When I have a duty to act I want to be certain that I can do something to try and save the life of an injured person., National Institutes of Health I have been accepted to the Intramural Research Training Award Program at the National Institute of Mental Health to complete a one year research program.  I am working in the Unit of Behavioral Genetics in the laboratory of Molecular Pathophysiology, Mood and Anxiety Disorder Program under the supervision of Dr. Alexi Morozov.  My research project will focus on behavioral roles of molecules involved in neuronal plasticity such as Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)., Organic Chemistry Tutor I started out by helping students in the library with their organic chemistry courses, I enjoyed going around the library tables seeking people struggling with their preparation and offering help. Later, I took a course titled Introduction to College Tutoring that mandated me to be employed at the Undergraduate Tutorial Center at NC State University. I started out having two students for the fall; both were minorities and underrepresented. In the spring, I had three students one of whom was a minority. All tutees were able to improve by at least one letter grade. One of the students that I tutored in the fall requested my help again in the spring semester. To me, that was a sign of how effective I can be when helping others.  After one year of tutoring, I received an Advanced Tutoring Certificate from the College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA).  During the last spring semester at NC State I tutored four students. From this experience, I learned how to build up a professional relationship with my tutees. I was able to balance between being serious and being humorous which proved to be an effective way of communication during tutorial sessions., Same Day Surgery Volunteer I volunteered at the Same Day Surgery department. I was responsible for transporting the patients from the recovery room to their families waiting at the hospital's exit. Moreover, I helped the nurses with their needs when looking after their patients. Within weeks of my volunteering, I had the opportunity to observe six operations - two heart catheterizations, two laparoscopic cholecystectomies, an endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy and a cecum colonoscopy. I also shadowed Dr. Joseph Falson, a cardiologist, for six hours in the Catheterization lab. Until I moved to Cincinnati for my premedical enrichment experience, I had volunteered at Duke Health Raleigh Hospital for one hundred and twenty hours., Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Kappa Honor Societies Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Kappa are two separate national honor societies that recognize academic excellence. While Phi Kappa Phi recognizes and promotes academic excellence in all disciplines, Phi Beta Kappa is a leading advocate for the liberal arts and sciences at the undergraduate level. Membership to both honor societies is by invitation only., University Official Clubs Since the first semester at NC State, I have been an active Biology Club member. I assisted the club during several fundraisers and activities.  I also joined the Young Scientist Program, an organization that seeks to enrich elementary students' experience in science through tutoring and demonstration (in class and out of class).  I was an active member until I was elected to an officer position were I became responsible for the demonstrations at Fred Olds Elementary School.  The position I held required me to acquire many organizational skills that helped me out managing the demonstrations., HHMI Summer Research Internship- NC State University The Howard Hughes Medical Institute Summer Research Internship was an eight-week program. Microbiology was my research field with Dr. Eric Miller being my mentor. The aim of my research project was the genetic manipulation of the bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus using transformation, conjugation and transduction by bacteriophage KVP40. At the end of the eight-week program, I presented a poster at The Third NC State University Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium and was awarded with the Best Research Presentation. One of the judges commented that one of the reasons I received the award was because I simplified and explained my research project to people without a scientific background in a good manner. An article about the award I received was included in the Technician, the university's newspaper, and another feature story was included in the Undergraduate Research Journal of North Carolina State University. By the beginning of the fall, I presented another poster at the Triangle Undergraduate Research Symposium sponsored by Duke University. The research experience I acquired along with the professional atmosphere that I worked in are considered a milestone in my education., Eligibility Screener The Open Door Clinic addresses health care for uninsured and indigent people by providing comprehensive medical, pharmacy, and ancillary care at no charge to patients. My position was to determine whether patients are eligible for clinic services through one-on-one confidential interviews and if eligible, fill out personal forms and get their consent for examination. Sometimes, I would start talking to the patients, for example, about the weather.  In many cases the patient suddenly started elaborating about their illness which gave me confidence in my ability to make the patients comfortable while talking to them. At other times, I had to give the patients the bad news about not being eligible for treatment because they did not meet the requirements for free examination. That was frustrating for both them and me and situations like that have further strengthened my determination to persue a career in the medical field.  Observing underrepresented and minority patients stand inline and wait desperately for long hours to be examined by a doctor has had a huge impact on my desire to become a physician., Summer Premedical Enrichment Program The Summer Premedical Enrichment Program is a six-week residential summer program where premedical students receive intensive exposure to medicine as a career through tours, speakers, seminars, and shadowing. Pre-meds are exposed to the medical school experience and the academic curriculum through a noncredit course in cardiophysiology and an extensive interaction with medical students and faculty. Through this program, I had the opportunity to go into the anatomy lab and have a look at the cadavers. I shadowed several cardiothoracic surgeons for eight hours a week. Moreover, I observed a Wolf Mini Maze done by Dr. Randall Wolf, an esophagectomy, a triple heart bypass and a heart angiogenesis in addition to several other operations. Furthermore, I had hands on the da Vinci Robot which is being used in some surgeries. At the end of the program, I  had a total of sixty hours of shadowing the surgical team in the operating room and the trauma team in the emergency room., University Scholars Program The University Scholars Program is a three semester  living-learning program for academically talented students. The program enriches the undergraduate experience through required Honors coursework and a series of carefully designed out-of-class experiences. As a student in the program, I took Honors courses and fulfilled the program's requirements by attending the Scholars Forum every week, attending some political discussions about the US and the world, and going to cultural and international events., Lab Assistant This experience was a financial aid work-study job. My main task was washing the dishes and autoclaving the media. There was nothing exciting about washing glassware but I had the opportunity to build relationships with professors and graduate students. The lab I worked in had several students from different countries, which enriched my cultural diversity experience. At the beginning of the summer, I was offered a research project with one of the graduate students but due to my commitment to the HHMI Summer Research Internship, I had to decline that opportunity., Cashier This experience was a summer job that I got after I finished my 12th grade. It was a great opportunity to get in contact with people and to improve my communication skills.  Moreover, it was an opportunity to work with employees from different races and backgrounds., Saturday Science Academy Boys Club With six other Biology students and the help of a professor at NC State University, we organized a program for minority children at the Boys Club in Raleigh. Every other Saturday, we prepared some experiments and demonstrated them for the kids. In some experiments, the boys had hands on experience and performed some experiments themselves. That was a great opportunity to enhance my interaction with children."

    "text": "Life-defining moments change us because we realize something incredibly obvious, we learn about people, or we discover how the world works.  A few of my moments have proven to me that I love science, learning new perspectives, and following my intellectual curiosity.\t \tWhile in high school I took a few college classes.  I did not always know the answer but instead of finding it frustrating, I loved it.  Since then, I have always been driven to overcome challenges.  I also discovered that independent study is actually a golden opportunity to learn exactly what you want to learn.  I came to college with the greatest advantage of all; I knew that independent study was actually a philosophy. It harmonized personal curiosity and imagination with the practical knowledge to apply it. \tMy first hint that I loved science was that I did well in those classes.  My second clue was a fetish for science magazines.  When people were chatting about the latest cinemas, I would introduce an astounding accomplishment from Scientific American or an outrageous gadget in Popular Science.  For example, a scientist from Stanford University was able to isolate liquid light. He manipulated physical conditions to give light the fluid properties of a liquid.    Engineers could make paper thin watches that withstood 10 times more pressure than a human and I knew about it.  When science fiction became reality, I definitely noticed.  I also recognized new movies and my knowledge of sports was just like that of any other guy my age--abundant and useless. In the interim, however, I followed my inquisitiveness for the excitement of science. \tI learned many years ago that trying new things has many rewards.  However, nothing compares to finding a natural affinity.  Specifically, I tried painting once.  I never thought I would even be mediocre at it.  Incredibly, I found it to be the greatest distraction. It also miraculously fine tuned my concentration, dexterity, and attention to detail.  Soon I was painting to feed a creative outlet that had been suppressed for too long.  I found myself focusing on projects for long periods of time with a new vision that extended beyond an immediate gratification. \tMy foray into the world of art led me to London and Paris.  Amidst the grand melodious symphonies and buildings whose history described Roman conquests, I saw that greatness is not limited to the arts.  In Oxford, I studied the National Health System of England. I saw how different medicine is in another country--from the education to its infrastructure.  At the National Medical Museum in London, I saw the innovations of British scientists such as Rosalind Franklin, who was instrumental in the X-ray crystallography used to deduce the three dimensional structure of DNA.  I learned that science, like art, has no limitations in its attempt to drive discovery and achievement.  After this trip, my commitment for science was strengthened as I began to see science as not just journal articles and repetitious experiments.  The greatest scientists were visionaries that were as creative as Beethoven and Monet.  Science and medicine emerged as my true calling.  Medicine is actually the cutting edge of the best part of science and it combines everything that I had always been drawn too.  It involves people and using an artist's palate of science, technology, and ingenuity to help someone.  \tA final life changing moment was realizing that subjects of study are not isolated in form or function.  As a high school student about to enter college, Economics was the last thing I expected to study.  Nonetheless, I decided that the experience was worth trying and to my amazement, I was fascinated.  It was completely different from the classes I was accustomed to taking and challenging in a totally novel way.  In the upshot, I loved learning about economics' impact on society and I decided to make it my second major.  It adds to my understanding of the complexities of our world and each day I learn more about how deeply it is seeded in our lives.  The economic and financial aspects of medicine are increasingly more influential and I believe obtaining a better understanding of their roles will someday make me a better doctor.\t \tThe uniqueness of my education truly lies in the perspectives I had coming into college and the ways that I am starting to see how different parts of classroom and life-education actually come together. The examples given here of a few life changing moments may not seem so dramatic, but they are more than casually picking up a magazine, trying out a paint brush, or simply taking a trip.  For me, reading about exciting inventions in a magazine fostered my interest in science which, I now see, is easily integrated into economics, art, or many other fields.  Capitalizing on life-changing moments by applying the lessons learned in one area to another has allowed me to sculpt my education around my passions.  In medical school, I look forward to learning the details of how medicine integrates everything I love, and to transforming that knowledge into a tangible skill. I believe my next life defining experience will be the study of medicine. The Fourth Annual University Honors Program Art Exhibit Art, specifically painting, is great way to exercise concentration, dexterity, attention to detail, and creativity. I had no intention of painting for awards or commendations of any kind. I was painting simply because it was fun. When I set forth to start my painting of a classic sixties diner, I had no idea where it was going to lead me. After three hours of work, I had a grand total of ten square inches covered of a sixty square inch canvas. I initially thought the whole project was going to take only three hours. Thus, began a marathon of painting. For six months I sat down with the thought that surely today I would finish the painting. Finally, the day came when the painting I visualized was on the canvas in front of me. Just finishing the painting was a tremendous achievement to me--but this painting's story was just beginning.  One day, a friend of mine noticed the painting and casually suggested that I enter it in the upcoming annual Honors Program Art Exhibit. Even though I was initially intimidated by the notion that I would also be competing with art majors--not to mention the rest of campus--I decided to see how my work would contend with others. To my amazement, two of my painting were selected--my sixties diner and a velvet painting of a castle that I had finished a year earlier., Secret  Shopper As a Secret Shopper, I was an employee of the University of Dayton Dining Services Department. My job was to critique various menus at the cafeterias on campus. The purpose of my job was to give dining services a better idea of how the student body was reacting to menus and the performances of the various cafeterias. In a sense, you could consider my job half James Bond, half Julia Child.  It was a very fun job and hopefully it allowed the dining services to better serve the campus., Intramural Football Team Captain Football has been one of my favorite sports since Joe Montana and Jerry Rice dominated Superbowls. I never had a chance to play for high school or pee wee leagues, but I knew I was pretty good and I always had fun. So my freshman year of college I decided to start an intramural team with some of my friends. As captain, I was responsible for making sure we had enough players, organizing practices, and most importantly, making sure it was as fun as possible. I learned a lot about teamwork, and gaining new skills. Although we did not win the intramural championships, we did have a lot of fun and it was definitely an unforgettable experience., Member of the University of Dayton Varsity Tennis Team I played varsity tennis throughout high school and for five years before that. I had always played well and had great fun but I never had any intention of playing for college. Playing varsity tennis in high school is one thing, but to play varsity tennis in college was something I definitely wanted to say I did. Sophomore year, I tried out and successfully made the varsity team. Unlike high school, college tennis was far more team oriented. The only way you could advance in a tournament is if the whole team advanced. In high school, all that mattered was how good your personal record was. Playing college tennis was the greatest exercise in teamwork I have ever had. Every practice was about maximizing your ability to contribute to the team. Getting better meant helping your teammate as much as it meant helping yourself. Teamwork is often an essential part of maximizing productivity and this was certainly the case. I can now not only look back and be proud that I was able to play varsity tennis for a division one school, but I was also able to help my entire team get better and achieve great success., Research in Genetics Lab In the summer of 2005 I started research in the University of Dayton Genetics Laboratory under Dr. Mark Nielsen. His research attempts to answer why some phenotypes evolve, such as butterfly wing patterns, while others do not, such as the 9+2 axoneme architecture of sperm tails. Thus far, his research reveals that there are exciting details to be discovered in how protein function relates to phenotypic evolution.  My role in this research deals with evaluating which insect species use the beta 2 tubulin protein as the major player in sperm tail assembly versus those insects who use alpha tubulin. Since some insects are relatively closely related, such as the Anopheles mosquito and the fruit fly, patterns in evolution can be observed as to which species evolved to use alpha tubulin versus beta 2 tubulin. For example, Anopheles has evolved over the course of millions of years to use alpha tubulin, while the fruit fly still uses the relatively antiquated beta tubulin. Discovering the mechanism that created this difference has many consequences to both micro and macro evolution--and the search is what makes research exciting. In the spring, I will present my project at the university's annual Stander Symposium, which recognizes scholarly extracurricular achievement., Study Abroad in London and Paris One of the most memorable experiences of my life was studying abroad in London and Paris. Through the University of Dayton's study abroad program I was able to take Music in Concert and Introduction to Visual Arts. While in London I saw world class musicians in grand symphonies, as well as world class musicians improvising on the street. The city's buildings alone told stories of Roman conquests, Victorian elegance, and post modern creativity. Paris was intertwined with artistic culture from the famed Mona Lisa to their masterfully decorated pastries. I was able to see the French Open Tennis Championships, which is one of the grandest stages in all of tennis. What I experienced while studying abroad was far more than Mozart's masterpieces, Da Vinci's paintings, or International sporting events; I was fortunate enough to obtain a more international perspective. Not only was I able to learn about specific topics such as medicine in another country, I was also able to be a part of an entirely different culture. For example, I learned local traditions, international politics and new lingo. By being immersed in local concerts and street artists, my curriculum was greatly enhanced--I definitely learned far more than what was on the syllabus., Member of University of Dayton Neighborhood Advisory Board The Neighborhood Advisory Board is a student-run council of the student neighborhood that acts as a liaison to the university's residential services department, and I represented my street of houses. The council made many decisions improving the student neighborhood. For example, we organized a campus wide recycling program, and a clean up program to beautify the neighborhood. Our goal was simple: to continue to provide a safe and fun place for the students to live., Member of Alpha Epsilon Delta (Pre-Health Honor Society) The Ohio Eta chapter of Alpha Epsilon Delta is an honor society unlike any other on campus at the University of Dayton. It values service, leadership, and commitment to the various Prehealth studies as well as the community. For example, in addition to volunteer work at various hospitals, we also promoted campus wide safety awareness and worked toward beautification of student neighborhoods and dorms. The organization constantly invited speakers who were cutting edge in their medical research as well as inviting prominent humanitarians, who were cutting edge in their impact on their communities. The organization enhanced the premedical program of the university by helping to create a community of highly motivated and interested students. It provided shadowing opportunities, educational opportunities, and a place for students with similar interests to be an integral part of a highly respectable organization--one that was awarded top organization on campus three years in a row by the student activities board. As a member, I participated in several volunteer activities through Children's Hospital in Dayton, as well as volunteering in the student neighborhoods., Shadowing a Pulmonologist The summer is filled with opportunities to excel extracurricularly. In the summer of 2003, I was interested in obtaining some first hand clinical experience.  By shadowing a physician, I could gain a better understanding of clinical medicine and what it takes to be a good doctor. I also wanted to learn about a field of medicine I was unfamiliar with. For example, I had some idea of what internal medicine, pediatrics, or cardiology was about. However, I was not exposed to Pulmonology and I knew that it provided a tremendous service to the community. Dr. Prasad Devabhaktuni was a well established Pulmonolgist, not only as a clinician, but as a teacher as well. He had a great demeanor and his patience was remarkable. He did not hesitate to explain technical procedures or pathophysiology of complicated diseases. Shadowing Dr. Devabhaktuni was one of the best experiences of any summer. I learned what it took to be an excellent, well respected clinician. I learned it requires great skill and know how, but most importantly, he showed me the power of a great demeanor and attitude. Only seeing a summer's worth of procedures, diagnostic exams, and consultations was an unforgettable experience , but I look forward to learning even more someday., President of South Asian Student Association The University of Dayton has always had a diverse student body and an increasingly popular South Asian studies department. However, there was no opportunity for students studying South Asian culture and history to meet outside the classroom and enhance their curriculum. Reading about traditional Indian dance does not at all carry the same experience as attending a classical Indian dance recital. A friend and I started the University of Dayton chapter of the South Asian Student Association to create a place for students with similar interests and those studying South Asian culture to further their experience. As President, I organized discussion groups, viewings of historical films, fundraising, and dance recitals. Since the organization started with just my friend and myself, it was busy at first, but luckily its popularity grew and we were able to create a committee to dole out some of the duties. As a senior, I hope to double the activities and establish the South Asian Student Association as one of the more enjoyable and educational organizations on campus., Representative of the University of Dayton Honors Council The University of Dayton Honors and Berry Scholars program gives students, who are highly motivated, a chance to go above and beyond the regular undergraduate experience. Some ways they do this are through seminars, offering special sections of courses, providing concerts, and encouraging thesis work.  For the large part, the decision makers of this program are a group of faculty who determine the program for the year's activities. In 2005, the faculty wanted a better input from the students. Thus, they established a council of students representing each major of the College of Arts and Sciences to contribute suggestions in order to make the Honors Program better; my role was to represent the Premedicine Major., Member of University of Dayton Volunteer Rescue Squad There are very few opportunities for an undergraduate student in the premedical track to gain first hand clinical experience in medicine. Volunteering for the University of Dayton Rescue Squad as an EMT-Basic, provided one of the best experiences of my college career. Not only was it perfect to gain experience, but it also was one of the most respected organizations on campus. In fact in 2003, the University of Dayton student volunteer rescue squad was named top EMS organization by the National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation. The certification class was one semester long and involved two four hour lectures a week, in addition to lab experience. The topics taught included basic life support, patient assessment, and advanced airway. As a member of the university's rescue squad I dealt with patients first hand, providing prehospital care and transport. This experience taught me leadership in my community, teamwork, and basic emergency medicine., University of Dayton Ethics Bowl When I took Introductory Philosophy, I did not realize how interesting the class was. The professor was dynamic and he always told a great story. Then I took Ethics and I learned about the dynamic of decision making. While taking Eastern Philosophy, my professor recommended me to the university's ethics bowl team. The ethics bowl team competes with other schools in a debate format concerning various ethical issues ranging from plagiarism to abortion. It was an excellent opportunity to practice the speech and debate skills that I learned in high school, while learning more about philosophy.  My specific role was to contribute on Biomedical issues and this allowed me the opportunity to learn about cutting edge medical issues while gaining input from various other fields of studies., Tutoring Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Economics When you teach or present a topic, you learn it far better than just reading about it. I tutored Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Economics. It was an excellent way to commit the topics I learned in those classes to memory and it was a lot of fun to help other students. Tutoring through the University's Learning Enhancement and Academic Development Department (L.E.A.D.) was an excellent way to provide a needed service and see direct results. I could tell whether or not I was doing a good job, by simply seeing how the classmates I was helping did after working with me. I was providing a service I was good at and seeing outstanding results--a skill I wish to carry with me into the medical field someday., Member of Chess Club Whether it is playing competitive tennis or trying Tae Kwan Do for the first time, I have always enjoyed playing sports. Chess has always interested me and I did not play in high school so I thought college would be a wonderful opportunity to become a better chess player. I joined the Chess Club and every Tuesday we would meet, and whoever wanted to could compete in the ultimate battle of wits. It was very competitive, and an incredible exercise for the mind. Few activities can hone skills, such as thinking several steps ahead, like chess, and I think it made me a better athlete and student."

    "text": "My day had been as routine and dull as every other in the semester.  The morning was filled with the rather monotonous business classes I had become accustomed to and now I was attempting my familiar drive into work.  Without warning, the car ahead of me swerved off the road quickly colliding with a nearby telephone pole.  I immediately pulled over, jumped out of my car and sprinted to the driver's window.  The frantic elderly woman in the passenger's seat was hysterically screaming that her husband had grabbed for his chest before the collision.  All the man could do was groan as his wife repeatedly screamed his name.  Feeling an immense amount of adrenaline surging through my body, I quickly dialed 911 and out of pure instinct instructed the woman to step out of the car so I could help her husband.  After deflating the airbag with my key, a desperate feeling of powerlessness instantly overtook me.  Realizing that I had no previous medical training, I sat there just staring at the man, incapable of any other course of action.  Even now all I can remember is an insurmountable desire to help that man, extinguished by my medical ineptitude.         It's an old cliche, a drastic event, an unforgettable experience leads a person down a path of lengthy introspection and thus as I examined my life, and attempted to figure out who I really was, I quickly found myself confronted by the glaring fact that my decision to pursue a college curriculum in business had not been made because it was what I truly desired.  Instead I found that I chose to study a business curriculum out of a rebellious desire to oppose my father's aspirations for his son.  Although he intended no harm by it, throughout the course of my childhood my dad would routinely emphasize his hope that perhaps one day I would become a physician.  To this day I can still picture him kindly looking me in the eyes and, in his New York accent, telling me how my unique level of compassion combined with my brains were two qualities that would make me a successful doctor.  As I entered college, the decision to pursue a business degree was my unconscious method of proving to my father and to me that I was capable of making a major decision independent of his influence.       As I replayed the accident in my head, continually reminding myself of the daunting image of that elderly man dying as I sat there powerless, I felt myself becoming deeply in touch with a passion that I had actively suppressed for so long; to become a doctor.  As I heard myself tell my father that I had decided to switch majors so that I could enter a career in medicine, I am still not sure who was in a greater state of shock.  Whatever the case, following my delayed and roundabout decision to become a doctor, I found in myself a rejuvenated interest in school as I had emphatically declared my major in my true love of science.        As I progress further into my college education I can sense an innate drive consisting of an incredibly strong desire to help people teamed with the personal fulfillment of finally being intellectually challenged.  I completely believe that the chance to practice medicine will offer a daily sense of fulfillment that is extremely rare.  To be perfectly honest, it is uncertain if I would have found this inner drive had it not been for the accident during the fall semester of 2003.  For whatever reason, my determination to establish my independence almost completely masked my aspiration to become a physician.  That is not to say, however, that I hold any regret whatsoever as to the path I have taken, as I can earnestly state that a career in medicine is what I sincerely want without hesitation.  My recent experiences in academic exploration, community services, and employment have only strengthened this motivation as I have learned that I enjoy both the caring, personal interactions and the intellectual discovery that being a physician would offer me.  For an example, I highlight my volunteer experience with the local hospice.  My core responsibility entails acting as an aide and providing supplemental support to an individual who has been diagnosed with less than six months to live.  My hospice work has left me feeling challenged, intrinsically torn between the severity of the illnesses of the patients and the intellectual curiosity that naturally arises when faced with the specifics of each patient's disease and medical complications.  Collecting as much information as possible, I am challenged with the task of negotiating the best possible angle from which to truly help the patient.  Hospice work has also presented me the opportunity to develop close, personal relationships with the individuals in need, and to aid them during the last critical stages of their life.  Thus, I have also found that the position presents itself with enormous emotional obstacles.  The experience has greatly impacted me and has strengthened my quest to become a doctor.  The hospice has shown me that medicine is indeed a multi-dimensional profession that requires both extensive intellectual capabilities as well as a strong humanitarian desire.  I believe I can honestly state that this balance that exists in medicine is something that I wholeheartedly want to experience. Big Brother After the Communities in School volunteer position ended I decided that becoming a Big Brother would be a rewarding experinece.  Although I have not been a Big Brother for very long, I feel I have already developed a strong bond with my little brother.  Each week I get together with my Little Brother and I try to enable him to experience things that his situation had previously not allowed him to do.  I also am quite intent on improving his scholar ability and as such dedicate some time to activities that will strengthen his performance in school., Tutor and Mentor Communities in Schools is a unique program in that the volunteer starts strictly as a tutor to a lower echelon student in Kalamazoo Public Schools.  As the tutor and student develop a closer relationship, the tutor is presented with the opportunity to expand his or her's responsibility to become a mentor.  I chose to become the student's mentor and as such I tutored the student during the hours of school and was able to provide the child with unique experiences outside of school.  Basically, becoming the child's mentor was similar to being a Big Brother., Aide in an after school reading program For the past two years, through the funding of a grant, my mother has been able to provide an after school reading program to her students.  I helped to run the program and primarily was in charge of helping children develop and build upon their reading skills., Research I am slated to begin research in the fall with an associate chemistry professor.  Her specialty is stereochemistry of compounds ecspecially in ligands and certain catalysis., Teacher/ Day care provider I have worked at a daycare for much of my college career to finance a majority of my expenses incurred during my schooling.  My experience with the daycare has been highly influential as I have gotten the chance to work with children ranging in age from 3 months to 12 years.  For the younger children my main responsibility has been to care for them and act as a true day care employee.  As the children age my responsibility increases as I must also act as a teacher in additon to the regular day care role.  I would like to add that due to the length of time that I have worked at CDC my knowledege of children and how to interact with them has become a skill in which I take great pride in., Phi Kappa Phi (Honors Society) I was inducted as a member into the Western chapter of the honor society of Phi Kappa Phi., Summer Camp Counselor I worked as a day camp couselor for the YMCA.  Each week I was assigned to a new group of approximately 10 children.  My main duties were to supervise the campers in their daily activities and to ensure that they had a positive camp experience.  I was also in charge of a transportation site that was responsible for busing approximately 75-100 to and from the camp., Emergency Room Volunteer My main duties included helping the triage nurse with incoming patients and also providing patients with items that would make their hospital visit more comfortable.  As a volunteer I had a large amount of patient interaction and also was able to witness numerous procedures and illnesses that came through the ER., Tour Guide My main duty was to provide a guided tour for prospective students., Hospice Volunteer My specific responsibilities with the Hospice vary with each individual assignment.  My main activity has been as a volunteer/ aide to an indiviudual who is on hospice care in a senior citizens home. The specific care I give is customized to the individual who I am assigned to.  Some of the people just want a companion.  A person to talk to or to complete activities with as they enter the last stages of their life.  Some of the people require care that is much more physically oriented and much closer to the medical field as a whole.  I also have been assigned to a person in a local live-in hopice facility.  Individuals who are close to the end come here when home care becomes troublesome and quite strenuous.  My duties here also vary a great deal as they must be adaptive to the specific case.  I also have been lightly involved with the fundraising events for the Hospice., Tennis lessons Throughout the summer of 2003 I gave discounted tennis lessons to a local neighborhood.  I taught on a court that was owned by a family friend who lived in the neighborhood and who also provided all the tennis balls and other materials needed.  On any given day I taught anywhere between 5-12 children., Phi Beta Kappa (Honors Fraternity) Towards the end of the Spring semester I was inducted into the honors fraternity of Phi Beta Kappa of Western Michigan University."

    "text": "There's no such thing as a final draft, said my 11th grade English teacher, Ms. Sackelman, as she glanced at the title of my essay, Only ever-revised, ever-refined pieces of writing.  Ironically, when I decided to become a doctor, those words resonated in my mind much more than anything I had heard in science class.  The science textbooks I read were perpetually reprinted in newer editions with more accurate information.  Physicians I shadowed incessantly learned advances in their field.  However, none of these encounters with revision was quite as powerful as the personal change I witnessed in my mother as she underwent a colon operation.  Her physical transformation prompted my discovery and subsequent re-evaluation of medicine as a career choice.  My mother resembled a fading shadow.  Fine wrinkles covered her sallow face and spidery blue veins bled beneath her skin.  Her mouth, which had laughed its way into the surgical ward, remained silent, the blue lips dry and cracked at the corners.  It's just the anesthesia, a nurse whispered reassuringly.  But lying there in that hospital bed, she was just a meager shell of my old mother.  My real mother was not the body lying on a hospital bed; she was the nurse who epitomized the soccer mom ideal, spending most of her day behind the steering wheel and working 12-hour night shifts at the hospital.  In my small family, she was not just a mom, but a dad as well.  I always pictured her as an extraordinary specimen, not made of the same breakable bones and fragile flesh as the rest of us.  But then suddenly, with a word I could barely pronounce, my superhuman mother shattered into tiny, irrecoverable pieces.  Diverticulitis.  My mom who took care of everything else often neglected to take care of herself.  One day she went to the doctor with a stomachache and called home nonchalantly to announce that the doctors needed to do a very simple procedure.    Nearly three hours and half a colon later, my mother emerged from the operating room like a science experiment etherized on the table.  Dr. Miller, my mother's surgeon, initially looked surprised to see only two children, but after realizing a father would not arrive, he began to explain my mother's condition.  Although I was only thirteen, Dr. Miller treated me like an adult, using words like abscess and peritonitis to explain the stitches on her abdomen.  He spent an entire hour answering my questions and reassuring my brother.  During the week my mother stayed at the hospital, Dr. Miller came to see us every day, bringing along cookies from the cafeteria and the charisma that allayed all our fears.  It dawned on me what a special position he held; he was curing my mother and easing our anxiety.  He was the type of person I had wanted to become.  Yet, just as I had to revise the initial image of my mother, this preliminary view of a doctor as hero would also soon be tested.  As I grew older, I learned that not all patient interactions would be as unproblematic or ideal.  I began to volunteer at a local nursing home, hoping to receive the kind of satisfaction Dr. Miller must feel.  While several residents thanked me for spending time with them, many told me to leave them alone.  One woman confessed she was ready to die; her family had not visited her since the day they left her at the home.  In my college career, I began to volunteer at Rivington House, a long-term care facility for patients with AIDS.  Almost every month, there would be conspicuous absences from Saturday night Bingo or Sunday lunch as more and more of the people to whom I had grown attached succumbed to AIDS.  Even working with children did not come as easily as expected.  While tutoring at a public school, I encountered students who had little interest in education and frequently belittled my emphasis on learning.    These experiences led me to wonder how doctors act in trying situations.  How will I treat a patient that no longer has the will to live or one who challenges my beliefs  Is the cost of forming relationships with terminally ill patients so high that I will become a detached observer  These are not questions that I can adequately answer.  Until I lose a patient under my care or have someone attempt to undermine my abilities as a physician, I cannot fathom how it must feel.  Although I cannot predict how I will cope with arising difficulties or promise that I will maintain a stoic attitude, I can only look to my past and hope that my former perseverance through failure and hardship along with an awareness of the difficulties that surely lie ahead will help me become the type of doctor who puts her patients before herself.    In writing, I learned the paradox of the words final draft.  Recently, I discovered those words have little merit in medicine either.  I am realizing that it is more important to constantly ameliorate myself to meet the demands of this challenging career.  Whereas once I wanted to be a hero like Dr. Miller, these days I aspire to the condition of that ever-revised, ever-refined piece of writing. General Chemistry I and II Recitation Instructor After working as a clinic instructor for one year, Professor Halpin invited me to become a Recitation Instructor.  Recitation instructors have more responsibility than clinic instructors--they grade quizzes, homework and tests, and hold office hours.  Out of all the recitation instructors, I was the only one who was not majoring in science.     On the first day of class, some students were apprehensive about having a TA who was a relatively young non-science major.  Throughout the semester I was able to allay their initial fears about me by showing them that not only do I understand the material well, I can also present it to them in a way that renders it comprehensible to the majority of the classroom.    Working as a recitation instructor helped me quite as much as it helped my students.  I began to realize my own capabilities.  I had imagined that I would be too shy of a person to stand in front of a classroom that included post-bacs and lead them in a discussion that would aid their learning.  Yet, my experience has shown me that I have leadership potential, and I simply need to trust myself., Summer Pre-medical Enrichment Program As a participant in SPEP, I have been exposed to a wide array of issues in medicine.  The program includes lectures in physiology, seminars concerning medical ethics and technological advances as well as ample physician shadowing.  I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to shadow two doctors--Dr. Randall Wolf, a cardio-thoracic surgeon, and Dr. David Witte, a pediatric pathologist.  Dr. Wolf, the director of the Center of Surgical Innovation, allowed me to actually test drive the Da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic operating machine which can be manipulated by a surgeon in another place for surgeries such as valve repair.  He also allowed me to stand in on one of his procedures, the Wolf Mini-maze, which corrects atrial fibrillation.  Dr. Wolf and his cutting edge technology are a paradigm of the amazing leaps in medicine today.  Until I began shadowing Dr. Witte, I knew little about pathology.  However, I realized its importance in diagnosing disease soon after Dr. Mei Lang, a resident, showed me the techniques used to analyze biopsies and make sample slides.  In addition, I was able to witness an autopsy of a newborn.  The case was tragic, and I did not know if I could go through with it.  Yet, once the autopsy began, I realized how many answers could be answered because of that autopsy, Dean's List At NYU, in order to be placed on the Dean's List, one must have completed 12 credit hours and have a GPA above 3.6.  With the exception of the second semester of my Sophomore year, I have consistently been on the Dean's List.  Spring 2003 was a difficult semester because I was tackling my hardest subject, Physics, and working nearly 20 hours a week because of some financial troubles my family encountered.  Ultimately, I did not do well in Physics.  The experience taught me to prioritize and manage my time.  By working more hours during the summer and moving to Brooklyn to lower my expenses, I had more time for school work.  The next semester, I received a 4.0., General Chemistry I and II Clinic Instructor General Chemistry Clinic workshops are designed to promote student interaction through working on chemistry problems.  My biggest challenge as a clinic instructor was helping students help each other.  Many of my students came into class trying to outshine their peers.  I made students realize that in a real scientific or medical community, progress does not occur solely because of one individual; rather we read of scientific teams making major strides.  I split the class into small groups, making sure that each group included students from all ranges--those who received A's and those who were on the verge of failing.  Once the A students realized that they also benefited from teaching their struggling peers, clinic became an enjoyable experience for everyone.  On my course evaluation forms, many told me I fostered an atmosphere of cooperative learning in an otherwise competitive school.  The experience also helped me develop a sense of leadership among peers., America Reads/America Counts Tutor I worked at a NYC public school, School for the Physical City, as part of a federal program known as America Reads/America Counts.  The program is designed to help NYC public school teachers in overcrowded classrooms by offering college tutors who can help struggling students one on one during class time.  I tutored middle school students in Math with Ms. Renee Streisand.  I gained a huge appreciation for NYC teachers during my two years.  Furthermore, my interaction with students who had little interest in learning and were frequently indignant helped me become a more resilient and versatile person., Discovery Point Child Care My experience at Discovery Point was perhaps the most challenging of all my experiences.  Initially, working with children seemed to me the ideal job.  However, my first day was more stressful than any test I had ever taken.  I was placed in a room with nearly 18 four-year old children along with another teacher.  As soon as the other teacher went to take her lunch break, the entire class fell into chaos.  At the end of the day, I was almost ready to quit.  Yet, I was determined not to fail.   Although initially the children were seemingly uncontrollable, by the end of the summer, nearly all of the children listened to me, and I actually began to enjoy my job.  I realized that if I struggle enough, I can persevere through just about anything.  I also learned that children are a lot of fun even if they are very difficult at times and, in some form, I wanted to work with children in the future., NYU Catholic Center Soup Kitchen Volunteer My priest suggested working at the parish soup kitchen on Monday mornings.  While I was initially shy about meeting new people, I actually made quite a few friends volunteering at the soup kitchen.  We helped prepare and serve meals for the homeless and worked on Christian ministry.  Like with my involvement in the NYU Anti-Hunger League, I was able to get to know many homeless people in the city.  In addition, I also saw how many young people were so willing to volunteer and interact with such people.  Although my generation has often been dubbed apathetic, my work with fellow students has shown that platitude certainly does not have any merit when it comes to the people I know.  Hopefully, I can join them on a Christian mission to a third world nation next year with the proper financial aid., Rivington House Volunteer Rivington House is an HIV/AIDS residential facility providing clinical services to clients by addressing physical, mental and spiritual needs in a supportive environment.  When I began volunteering at Rivington House, I worked on activities such as planning Saturday night Bingo and Sunday lunch.  However, working at Rivington House made me acutely aware of the HIV+ population in New York City.  Previously, I had an infantile notion that AIDS cannot occur to people I know because they are safe and educated, those illusions were quickly shattered.  I am very thankful that I came to understand the significance of this disease in our country, and not just in places like Africa.  Personally, I have felt its power as people I knew disappeared only to be replaced by a continual flow of newcomers.  Although I did not participate in the medical care of these patients, my interaction with them has helped me become more sensitive to their issues and aided my communication with high risk patients., Arthur J. Gavrin Foundation Scholarship Recipient The Arthur J. Gavrin Foundation was established by the sons of Arthur Gavrin, a prominent alumnus of the high school I attended.  Mr. Gavrin was a Polish immigrant who came to the United States during the 1930's.  The Gavrin Foundation awards scholarships ranging from $1000 to $9000 to graduating seniors of New Rochelle High School who have demonstrated a strong desire to further their education in the face of hardship.  The scholarship is meant for students that may have difficulty in attracting other substantial scholarship aid.  After interviewing with the members of the Gavrin family, I was awarded $6000 for my college education.  While many scholarships come from anonymous donors, I was fortunate enough to become acquainted with the Gavrins who have been very supportive of me throughout all my endeavors., French Book Award The French Book Award is offered during the Spring Semester of each year for students who are outstanding in their class.  For the past two years, I have received the French Book Award in Masterpieces of French Literature and French Poetry from Baudelaire to Present.  I was very happy to receive this award because French has been one of my favorite subjects since I began studying it in sixth grade.  The award also shows that even though I am only minoring in French, I still take it very seriously, not only because I love French literature, but also because I believe it will be a helpful tool when I become a doctor.  Many underserved  francophone areas in Africa are currently encumbered by the AIDS epidemic.  Therefore, I know that my skills in French will help me better comprehend my patients and their needs., Purls of Hope The Purls of Hope project is part of The Children's Hope Foundation, an organization that improves the quality of life for children, youth and their families affected by HIV/AIDS by meeting their social and medical needs.  Purls of Hope volunteers knit or crochet stroller blankets for HIV+ babies or babies born to mothers that are HIV+.  It was great to take my hobby and use it for a worthy cause.  While I have been met with skepticism from people who don't understand how an HIV+ baby will benefit from a home-made blanket, I know that the care that we put into each blanket will let the mother know that she and her baby are important to others, and not some pariahs that society wants to place on the backburner.  Even though Purls of Hope is simply a gesture, I believe that it is through such gestures that we can really help ameliorate our communities., NYU Anti-Hunger League Volunteer Volunteering with the members of NYU's Anti-Hunger League has been one of the most enlightening activities during my college career.  I became involved in a program called Mighty Meals in my Freshman year of college.  Mighty Meals provides brown bag dinners to the homeless.  Working with this group made me realize the number of homeless in New York and their needs.  Currently, I am working as the Mighty Meals Coordinator., Emory Eastside Emergency Department Volunteer When I started volunteering at the Emory Eastside Emergency Department, at first, I felt like I was doing very little to help.  Usually, I helped patients sign into to the Emergency Room to be triaged or I helped transport patients to their cars.  However, as I spent more time at the ER, I began to realize that my job behind the desk was not as insignificant as I imagined.  Most times, I was the first person that a patient saw when they came into the ER and often the person to whom many questions would be directed.  I learned about a lot of health-related issues through my conversations with patients including treatment of illegal immigrants and adequate health coverage.  Furthermore, some accommodating physicians allowed me to watch certain procedures, such as suturing and fixing dislocated bones."

    "text": "It was only my second day volunteering in the ER at Mt. Carmel East Hospital when I had a woman screaming and yelling at me. She was cradling her ten year old daughter who had possibly broken her leg and demanded to see a doctor immediately. Seeing the tears streaming down the little girl's face, I couldn't help but want to take her into triage right away. However, there were also many other patients waiting to be seen, some exhibiting possibly life threatening symptoms. I knew it was up to the staff to decide patient priority and I attempted to explain this to the distraught mother as best I could. My words fell on deaf ears. Her anger only subsided after verbally berating me for letting her daughter suffer and she eventually sat down fuming in the waiting area. I was quite upset after this exchange, not because of the mother venting her frustration on me, but at my own powerlessness to help. After the girl was treated, the mother came and apologized to me, even thanking me for being so patient with her. I understood that the duress of seeing a loved one in pain drove the mother to such desperation, so I couldn't blame her. This experience was a strong reminder though of why I wanted to be a doctor. I didn't want to stand there helpless, watching as the little girl cried in agony and the mother suffered alongside her. I wanted to be the one easing the girl's pain and calming the mother. I wanted to be the one making a tangible difference in improving people's lives.  My goals as a physician have been further shaped by my family. My parents immigrated to the U.S in the 1970's, working hard to learn English, but they could never attain the fluency of a native speaker. This was especially apparent during doctor visits, when my sisters or I would always be present to help interpret the doctor's instructions. This became even more important when my father was diagnosed with heart disease and had a cardiac stent implanted in his coronary artery. As I worked with the doctor to help my father understand the disease and treatment, I thought about how such an incredibly difficult and stressful situation could have been exacerbated by a language barrier. I saw how vital proper communication is to patient care and realized how growing up in a bilingual household speaking Cantonese and learning Mandarin in college could help me better serve Chinese American members of the community for whom English may not be a primary language.  I understand how difficult it is for non-English speaking minorities to obtain healthcare, so one of my goals is to try and overcome the language barrier as best I can to meet their medical needs.   I saw firsthand though, how important it is to reach out to all underserved communities as I shadowed Dr. Jack O'Handley, the director of the Mt. Carmel Community Outreach program. As I watched him treat patients who had no health insurance and were either homeless or in a half-way house, I noticed that many of them depended on Dr. O'Handley as their primary care physician. His work reinforced in my mind how crucial it is for doctors to take the extra step and make basic healthcare available for everyone. In addition, his interaction with one patient in particular was a prime example of how the inherent trust patients have in doctors can save lives. This patient initially described himself as suffering from work related injuries. However, as Dr. O' Handley questioned him about it, the patient revealed that the injuries were sustained many years ago and he was currently not in pain. He came because he was contemplating suicide and had even put a gun to his head. This man never once admitted to needing help, saying he only wished to talk. However, the fact that he came in the first place made it clear that he desperately wanted it, and the only reason he came was because he knew he could confide in a doctor. Dr. O' Handley did his best to counsel the patient, but ultimately he had the man taken to a medical center for further help. Just by making himself available and through his status as a doctor, Dr. O' Handley was able to prevent this man from committing suicide and get him the help he needed. Watching him save a life like that furthered my motivation to enter the profession and demonstrated how much impact a doctor can have on the lives of their patients.   I understood though, that becoming a doctor was not the only possible career choice for me. Clinical and basic research are also an integral part of healthcare and I had no doubt I could help make a difference in improving someone's life as a researcher. Earning a M.S. in biophysics made me realize though, that research alone is not enough to satisfy me. Forgoing the patient interaction would be too great a sacrifice. Thus, I hope to apply the skills and knowledge gained in graduate school to pursue medical research even as I practice medicine.   My experiences in both undergraduate and graduate school have helped me discover that my true passions and interests lay in medicine. I understand the rigors and responsibilities of the profession, but also the inherent rewards associated with it. I am confident that I can meet the demands required to be successful and I will continuously strive to improve the quality of life for my patients. ER Volunteer at Mt. Carmel East Hospital As a volunteer in the ER, my primary responsibility was to monitor patient status and work with the family and friends in waiting to keep them informed of the patient's condition and when they would be permitted to see them. This experience showed me another side of medicine as I was able to observe how the doctors, nurses, and social workers worked together to counsel the family and friends in their time of need. I learned how important it is to not only treat the patient, but also to provide support for the family as they suffer alongside their loved one., Organizer for Chinese Movie Nights As an avid watcher of Chinese movies, I wanted to share my interest with the Dartmouth student body. After joining the Dartmouth Chinese Culture Society, I organized weekly movie showings to promote another aspect of Chinese culture with the community. I obtained funding from the DCCS and the school to provide snacks and refreshments for moviegoers and reserved rooms for movie viewing. Moreover, I selected the movies to be shown each week, choosing films that were indicative of Hong Kong cinema in various genres. I had regular attendance from those wishing to learn more about Chinese culture and from students who sought a way to relax from a stressful week of school. I believe the movie showings were a good way of bringing the Chinese community together, especially during holidays like Chinese New Year's when I held special celebratory dinners to go with the movie. I held weekly movies during my Freshman through Sophomore years., Shadowing Dr. Jack O'Handley As the director of the Mount Carmel Community Outreach program, Dr. Jack O'Handley travels to various parts of Ohio with a health bus to provide free care to underserved communities. In my 5 weeks shadowing him, I went to locations such as homeless shelters and the YMCA to learn more about the doctor patient relationship and the responsibilities a physician has to the community. None of the patients he saw had health insurance, few had homes, and one area had mostly patients that didn't speak English. Watching him work to provide primary care to patients who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford it, showed me how critical it is to make basic healthcare readily available and how much of a difference a doctor can make in improving the lives of others. I saw how rewarding the profession can be and he serves as an inspiration for my own goals as a physician., OSU Medical Center Research Day Award Winner At the 8th annual Ohio State University Medical Center Research Day, I presented a poster entitled Effect of Ca2+ binding properties of TnC on the rate of skeletal muscle tension redevelopment for review and judging. In addition to talks by distinguished researchers on current topics in biomedical science, Research Day is an opportunity for student researchers ranging from the undergraduate, graduate, MD, and MD/PhD level to present their work alongside postdoctoral fellows and clinical residents and fellows for judging by medical center faculty. My work was selected as one amongst the hundreds of presentations to receive a travel award grant., Biophysical Society Annual Meetings I attended both the 2008 and 2009 annual Biophysical Society meetings held in Long Beach, Ca and Boston, MA, respectively. At the 2009 conference I was a co-author on a poster entitled The Rate Of Calcium Dissociation From The Cardiac Thin Filament Is Affected By Multiple Modulatory Factors. The 2008 meeting was my first time attending a scientific conference and it was incredible to see and learn about the research being conducted from around the world., EPR Research I participated as a research assistant in this project to determine if Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) dosimetry of environmental objects is a valid approach to measuring the level of radiation an area has been exposed to. If so, then a device could be developed utilizing EPR technology to measure the level of radiation exposure of an area after an incident, such as in a radiological terrorist attack. My job consisted of selecting and testing materials and determining if they would be useful dosimeters for the project. I selected materials based upon the likelihood of them being found in any given area, such as a variety of papers, pens, candies, and buttons and tested them for initial EPR signals. If they showed no initial signals that could interfere with radiation-induced signals, I exposed them to varying dosages of radiation and tested them for radiation-induced EPR signals over time. The results were presented at the BiodosEPR-2006 conference., Thick & Thin Filament Regulation in Striated Muscle Meeting I presented a poster entitled Effect of Ca2+ binding properties of TnC on the rate of skeletal muscle tension redevelopment at the first gathering of this new meeting which is designed to bring together researchers from around the world who focus in this area of muscle research. This was the first time I presented my work at a meeting and it was a fantastic experience to discuss and defend my research with experts in the field., Conference-Understanding Muscle: From Development to Disease I presented a poster entitled Effect of Ca2+ binding properties of TnC on the rate of skeletal muscle tension redevelopment at this meeting which focused on muscle function and how it related to disease., Volunteer at The Ohio State Medical Center I volunteered in the Ambulatory Surgery Ward at the Ohio State Medical Center transporting patients to the operating room, preparing rooms, delivering laboratory specimens to designated testing areas, and working together with the nurses and doctors., Muscle Physiology Research My graduate research is focused on the mechanics of muscle function, studying the properties of both cardiac and skeletal muscle and the factors that control contraction and relaxation. Under the guidance of Professor Davis, I perform whole muscle physiology experiments using single rabbit skeletal fibers and rat cardiac trabeculae to study the effects that regulatory proteins of the actin thin filament have on muscle. Current thought is that the actin thin filament plays either no role or a very minor one in regulating muscle mechanics. However, by generating mutations in the calcium regulatory protein of the thin filament, we studied their effects in simple biochemical systems all the way to whole muscle. Our work suggests that the thin filament plays a role at least equal to that of other muscle regulatory mechanisms and it is our continued goal to further research and explore its properties in hopes of utilizing it as a potential target for treatment of heart disease., Secretary for the DCCS and Far Off Broadway The Dartmouth Chinese Culture Society (DCCS) is a group that celebrates the Chinese culture and helps others become more aware of it as well. As an officer in the DCCS, I attended weekly meetings and recorded the minutes of the issues discussed, typically ones dealing with current issues on campus and at large. I was also responsible for addressing questions and concerns from members and non-members alike, participating and helping organize events such as culture shows and group outings, and scheduling events. Far Off Broadway is a theater group that celebrates the Chinese-American culture by holding a production every spring. My duties as secretary for Far Off Broadway were to coordinate efforts between members and officers in organizing and planning the spring production, helping decide on performances, providing advertising, and participating in the production myself. I served as the secretary for the DCCS for a year and served as the secretary for Far Off Broadway during the spring term of my freshman year., Shadowng in China While I was in Beijing, China as a part of a foreign studies program, I met Dr. Ling, a physician who treated me for a throat infection. I expressed my interest in medicine to her and she allowed me to shadow her during my stay to learn more about the medical practices in China. Although I was still learning Chinese medical terminology, she taught me about the medical system in China and how it differed from the U.S. She showed me how modern western medicine was used in conjunction with traditional Chinese medicines as a standard form of treatment. Differing cultures and traditions necessitated the fusion of the two and I saw how much of an impact cultural perspectives have on a patient's understanding of medicine."

    "text": "We have all heard adages of failure from our elders.  We are told failure is a character-building experience and that failure teaches us much about success.  An adage finds itself in common vernacular because it is time-tested and proven by experience.  However, as true as such an axiom may be, it is something that we hope pertains only to others  one lesson we can personally circumvent, yet still manage to acquire its knowledge through other means.  After all, who would want to fail if you could learn the same things through success   The memories that I have of my years at Northwestern are much different than those with which I expected to leave college.  While I fondly remember my explorations of Chicago, my academic successes, and my formative friendships, failure is paramount to my memories of college.  The adage proved unavoidable  my successes led neither to personal introspection, nor challenged me to adapt to a new obstacle.  Not to be misleading, my `failures in college were not rampant.  Rather, my `failure can be summed up as organic chemistry  the first `failure of my life, and one from which it has taken over three years to recover.  I was once told that if it were not for organic chemistry, there would be no lawyers.  After my second year of school, I had a profound understanding of the meaning of such a statement.  Prior to my sophomore year, I met with the Dean of Northwestern.  In an effort to study in France my junior year, I planned to take organic chemistry and biology concurrently as a sophomore.  The Dean informed me that attempting both classes at the same time could be GPA suicide, and that he never recommended such a course load for any student.  Nave to what I now know, I enrolled in both biology and organic chemistry.  In ignoring the deans advice, I followed my intuition.  I had never failed before.  I thought that the demanding course work would be a challenge, but with no precedent for personal failure, I felt I could conquer any academic pursuit.  As my transcript reveals, organic chemistry was not another flawless addition to a long list of academic successes.  The combined workloads of biology and organic chemistry proved to be too demanding; time prohibited me from mastering the subjects and I failed to perform at my ability level.  Organic chemistry left me with a science GPA difficult to recover from and, more importantly, it left me to grapple with a blow to my self-esteem and caused me to question my intellectual capabilities.  Even with solid grades from the latter half of college, I knew that I would be unable to alter my science GPA significantly, leaving me to ask myself if it were plausible to continue my pursuit of medical school.  A slight defeatist attitude beckoned me to explore those intellectual areas that came naturally to me.  Since the beginning of college I knew that I had diverse and unrelated passions, namely biology and public policy.  In choosing to pursue a background in the hard sciences, I knew that I was turning my back on that which was less challenging for me.   While I recognized that the sciences would demand much of me, I never imagined myself `failing, or finding myself at the crossroads that marked the end of my sophomore year.  Having learned the important lesson of knowing when to take the advice of experts (even if the advice is at odds with your personal judgment), I realized that it would be necessary to demonstrate a mastery of the physical sciences by taking time off after college for personal enrichment and to reestablish myself academically.  Notwithstanding the challenges I had in my science courses, my passion for medicine was steadfast.  I was still intrigued by the science I learned and had an insatiable desire to discover more.  To such an end, I dedicated the past year and will dedicate the upcoming year to pursuing the coursework and experiences necessary for me to realize my dream of becoming a physician.  Last summer I retook a year of organic chemistry; and unlike before, I received not only three As, but the highest grade in my class.  I discovered the time management skills and personal awareness it takes for me to be successful.  These are skills I never developed through my previous academic pursuits, but that now provide me with a powerful arsenal of techniques that I will employ for success in my future coursework.  During the upcoming year I will be working toward a Masters in Physiology and Biophysics at Georgetown.  This program, which allows students to complete most of the first year medical school coursework, is ideal for me.  I am excited to face the challenges presented by my classes; while at the same time, I am invigorated by the opportunity to continue to prove myself academically.  Often the path taken to any goal is the most direct route.  For me this has not been the case; however, today I stand in a different place than I did a year ago.  In addition to a healthy respect for others advice, my self-awareness of my intellectual capabilities, my capacity to recover from setbacks, and my dedication to my dreams have grown tremendously.  I am proud to say that I am a well-qualified applicant who has found a workable balance between self-confidence and personal humility.

    "text": "I want to use my life to make a difference in the lives of others.  This passion for and love of people has always compelled me to serve in my community and world at large.  However, this passion turned into a drive to pursue medicine when I began volunteering in the emergency room of Los Angeles County Hospital.  I realized that I could impact lives at the most fundamental level, by alleviating pain and saving life.  I have since taken steps to fulfill this goal and hope to pursue this dream beginning in medical school.  My journey has been far from direct, but these experiences have prepared me for my pursuit to impact lives through medicine.  I have always loved working with people, especially children.  In high school, I started a homework club at a local elementary school for children living in a government-subsidized housing unit.  By tutoring in math and reading, I became addicted to working with the children.  I enjoyed playing handball with them as well as helping them with their homework.  Taking this passion with me to the University of Southern California, I served inner-city youth through Troy Camp, the Trojan Knights, and the Joint Educational Project.  I established friendships with my students while helping them improve their test scores.  Students often excitedly told me about their favorite musicians or playing basketball with their friends.  Each of them only wanted someone that would listen, and I seemed to fill that need.  The realization that I was making a positive impact in their lives as a friend and positive male role-model was the most exciting and gratifying feeling.  During the first couple years of my undergraduate studies, my passion to serve my community was totally engrossing, while my academic passions were still underdeveloped.  Consequently, my grades were below my capabilities.  Science had always fascinated me, but I had neither the guidance nor direction in pursuing it.  It was not until I began volunteering in the emergency room of Los Angeles County Hospital that my academic goals became clear.  One Saturday night, I witnessed a teenage boy wheeled in with a gunshot wound.  His expressionless face masked his fear and pain, but his blood drenched t-shirt could not.  Every drop of blood loosened his grip on life, yet there was nothing I could do.  This situation was different from working with inner-city children.  Only the knowledge and expertise of the physicians could alleviate the child's suffering and restore his life.  By saving the boy's life, the physicians made an impact on the boy unfathomable to me at the time.  It was the kind of impact that I had always longed to make.  It was what had motivated me to work with inner-city children in the first place.  Everything I had done was for this opportunity to change someone's life.  The physicians were doing exactly that by saving lives that would have been lost and improving lives troubled by chronic disease.  This experience ignited in me a desire to serve people by combining my interest in science with my passion to serve.  I realized that the first step in my journey would be to improve my academic record and enhance my scientific education.  With this goal in mind, I completed my masters in physiology and biophysics at Georgetown University.  During this time, I became particularly interested in neuroscience and stem cell science.  I decided to work in the laboratory of Dr. Bruce Trapp in the Neuroscience Department of the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute.  Combining in vivo and in vitro techniques, I have been studying neural stem cells and their therapeutic implications in treating de-myelinating diseases of the central nervous system.  We have shown the existence of a previously unidentified pre-progenitor cell in the subventricular zone of the mammalian brain and its ability to myelinate a myelin deficient rat model.  I have co-authored a paper titled A Stem Cell Source for Myelination in the Mammalian Brain that is being submitted to the New England Journal of Medicine.  Our work was also presented in a poster at the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute Research Day.  My new commitment to medicine also motivated me to take post-baccalaureate science courses while improving my MCAT scores.  Through work in the lab and classroom, I have prepared myself to face the academic challenges of medical school by strengthening my scientific background.  Medicine is the field in which I desire to combine my academic and humanistic interests to directly impact the lives of others.  My journey has been long and roundabout, but every challenge and detour has confirmed my passion to pursue medicine.  I am prepared to face the academic and emotional challenges of medical school with the skills I have developed in the community, laboratory, and classroom.  I will work to further develop these skills so that I can impact the lives of others integrating basic science and clinical care. Small Group Leader All four years of college, I attended a Christian campus fellowship which held worship every Thursday night.  I was selected to head a freshmen small group my senior year.  As leader of the group, I had to prepare and conduct weekly bible study meetings.  Encouraging everyone to participate in discussion and sharing, I guided our conversations toward specific lesson goals.  I became a mentor and friend through Bible study and time spent after Bible study.  I also tried to help them assimilate to college life by doing things like taking them out to dinner or to the grocery store.  This experience broadened my interpersonal skills.  As each member of the group was unique, I learned to use different approaches to connect with each of them on an individual basis.  One student was a quiet introvert while another was very outgoing.  Two were very confident while the third struggled with low self-esteem.  The experience also sharpened my listening skills.  Practicing patience and empathy, my listening skills developed into one of my greatest strengths.  I believe understanding the struggles and concerns of patients will be the first step in treating them compassionately and effectively., Trojan Health Volunteer As a volunteer in the Evaluation and Treatment Center (ETC) of St. Vincent's Medical Center, I worked four hour shifts to aid physicians and nurses in the ETC.  I did everything I could, utilizing most of my time cleaning gurneys, stocking supplies, and running errands.  When given the opportunity, I shadowed physicians during procedures and interviews.  I also translated for the non-English speaking Korean patients that were frequently admitted into the ETC.  While volunteering in the ETC, I witnessed cases ranging from teenagers with head trauma to elderly patients with chest pain and difficulty breathing.  Working in the ETC, I learned about the physical, emotional, and intellectual demands placed on physicians.  I experienced the stressful atmosphere of the hospital during long overnight shifts and the difficulty in juggling numerous patients, including uncooperative and unresponsive patients.  However, I also felt the excitement and gratification that comes with caring for the sick.  It reminded me that I could make a difference in people's lives through the practice of medicine.  It motivated me to continue working towards my goal so that I might use medicine to help the sick., Core Leader/Bible Study Leader Committed to my local church as a Bible study leader and Core leader, I led college Bible study every Sunday for a group of about 15 college undergraduates.  I organized biweekly cell group meetings planning lessons and arrangements for food and facilities.  I served as a Core leader in charge of preparation for Sunday service and other church functions.  I led outreach events and planned fellowship activities such as our group outing to a Dodgers baseball game.  I also started Love Tijuana in our college ministry, for which we drove down to Tijuana, Mexico every month to serve the local people.  Although our main responsibility was teaching English to grade school children, I had the opportunity to assist the physicians, dentists, and optometrists who were a part of our team.  I saw how powerful and effective the doctors' skills were in reaching out to the people in need.  As soon as our buses arrived at the local sites, long lines of people would gather hoping to receive treatment and medicine.  I saw the dire need for healthcare outside the United States and the scarcity of professionals trained to provide it., AWANA Teacher/Sunday School Teacher During my four years as an undergraduate at USC, I volunteered in the AWANA club at my local church.  AWANA, which stands for Approved Workmen Are Not Ashamed, is an international youth organization with the purpose of teaching children about the Bible and raising them to be individuals of respectable character.  I taught classes of first and second graders about the lessons of the Bible and helped them learn specific verses within the Bible.  Additionally, I was in charge of the song time, which meant I had to select songs and lead the students with my guitar.  I served as the AWANA Olympics coach for one year, organizing and conducting weekly practices leading up to the AWANA Olympics.  We competed with other local churches playing team games such as balloon relay and tug-of-war.  I began working as a Sunday school teacher at Korean Central Presbyterian Church after moving to Cleveland, OH.  Using fun activities and creative stories, I have been teaching a class of third and fourth graders about different lessons to be learned from the Bible.  Through these experiences, I have learned all children are unique but deserve the same attention and love.  I have realized that setting a good example is the key to reaching children at such an impressionable age., Clinical Laboratory Assistant During my senior year at USC, I worked at the USC Dental School Oral Microbiology Testing Laboratory.  Though my main responsibility was plating and culturing clinical samples of oral pathogens, I also tested samples for Treponema denticola, a bacterial pathogen that causes periodontal disease in the oral cavity.  This process included extraction of genetic material, polymerase chain reaction, and gel electrophoresis.  My job also entailed preparing media and pouring plates.  I learned not only basic techniques of microbiology and molecular biology, but also the ability to manage time efficiently. This was essential in order to balance work and school., Phi Sigma Biological Honors Society During my senior year, I was invited and initiated into the Alpha Alpha chapter of the Phi Sigma Biological Honors Society at the University of Southern California for my commitment to research and academic excellence in the biological sciences.  We were involved in raising interest and awareness in biological research, by hosting talks and seminars by invited researchers to share their work with fellow undergraduates., Microsurgery Research Assistant During the summers of 2002 and 2003, I volunteered as a research assistant at the San Diego Microsurgical Institute.  I was responsible for aiding senior scientists with transplantations of the kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, and heart, while taking care of all lab animals.  I also performed the Lee modified Fox-Montorsi heart-lung transplant as part of a study to examine the efficacy of needles designed to revascularize ischemic myocardium.  While performing transplantation surgery in rats, I found the incredible precision and sophistication of the organism to be fascinating.  It sparked in me an interest to study anatomy and physiology.  I also learned basic microsurgical techniques, becoming proficient in techniques of vascular anastomoses.  Dexterity with fine surgical tools enabled me to restore blood flow during transplantation surgery.  During the summers at the San Diego Microsurgical Institute, I also had the opportunity to help run the 6th Congress of the International Society for Experimental Microsurgery.  I was in charge of providing all technical support for the meeting.  By using my time management and organizational skills, I ensured that all equipment and presentations were ready before each session.  My attention to detail was critical in hosting the meeting., Research Technician I have been studying neural stem cells and their therapeutic potential to treat de-myelinating diseases of the central nervous system.  This process has included culturing and transplanting neural stem cells, immunostaining brain tissue, and conducting animal behavior tests.  Proving their multi-potentiality in vitro and their ability to myelinate in vivo, we have identified a previously unknown population of pre-progenitor cells.  I have co-authored a paper on this work that is being submitted to the New England Journal of Medicine, while continuing this project through the characterization of other cell lineages.  I am very interested in the future of stem cell therapy, especially as it pertains to neurological disease.   I believe the study of stem cells will reveal treatments and potential cures for debilitating diseases such as quadriplegia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.  With a love for laboratory bench work I hope to integrate basic science research with clinical science as a practicing physician.  While learning the importance of perseverance and hard work, I never quit after a failed experiment.  I developed skills to analyze data and learned to continually ask meaningful questions that could be answered through a controlled experiment., Collegiate Medical Volunteer I volunteered through a program known as the Collegiate Medical Volunteers, rotating through two departments at Los Angeles County Hospital: one in the emergency room and one in internal medicine.  I transported patients, prepared IVs, cleaned beds, and did anything else that was needed in the ER.  The ER was extremely busy with patients coming in with severe trauma and disease.  Every time a severely wounded patient came in, I looked frantically for a way to help, but most often I found myself powerless and amazed by the physician's ability to think quickly and treat patients.  During my rotation in internal medicine, I shadowed physicians on their daily rounds getting the opportunity to watch physicians interact with their patients and colleagues.  I was exposed to the poor and minority populations of Los Angeles when I worked at Los Angeles County Hospital.  As patients often waited hours to see a physician, I had the opportunity to talk with patients about their lives and medical conditions.  I got a glimpse into the disparity that exists between health care available to different races and socio-economic classes.  I realized the necessity for future policy change but also my current obligation as a volunteer to show respect and compassion to all patients, regardless of race or economic status., Trojan Knights/Troy Camp Counselor I was a camp counselor for Troy Camp during my senior year at USC.  Troy Camp is a large, diverse philanthropy at USC with the goal of mentoring and supporting inner-city children of South Central Los Angeles.  We held a year of fun-filled activities for the children that culminated in a week-long camp at Idyllwild Pines.  These activities included a trip to a USC football game, a Halloween costume party, and a Thanksgiving potluck dinner.  Getting to know the children, I could see the great divide between America's rich and poor.  These children did not have the same opportunities I had been blessed with, and my work with them fueled my desire to give back to the community.  During my second and third year at USC, I served as a Trojan Knight in a brotherhood of students committed to serving the university and community.  I worked many university events, including Swim with Mike (a fundraiser for disabled student-athletes), home football games, and Parents' Weekend.  We carved pumpkins with the students of 32nd Street Elementary School and ran Knight Bowl, a bowling fundraiser for Troy Camp.  Taking on a leadership role in preparation for Knight Bowl, I organized teams to compete and solicited donations to give out as prizes.  We raised over a thousand dollars for Troy Camp., USC Student Senate Elections Commissioner I was one of five Elections Commissioners administering the presidential and senatorial elections for the USC student body.  My responsibilities included drafting the Student Senate Elections Code and executing the elections in a fair and efficient way.  In this role, I had to make many difficult decisions regarding questions, ambiguities, and violations of the Elections Code.  This meant issuing warnings, sanctions, and even disqualifications for various infractions.  When drafting the Elections Code, I worked with people of diverse backgrounds that had differing opinions.  I learned to articulate my opinions while respecting the opinions of others.  Collaborating and compromising with each other, we successfully outlined the rules and procedures for the whole process.  We also oversaw the voting process on the day of the elections.  I took leadership in monitoring the polls to make certain they were all manned and open.  I also enforced the zoning rule of the Elections Code, which stated that candidates would not be allowed within a specified zone surrounding the polling stations.  The day was a great success with the highest voter turnout to date., Georgetown Univ. Special Masters Program Homework Club Tutor I was thrilled to find this opportunity during my masters program because I was expecting to be too busy to serve in an inner-city youth program.  Meeting with a seventh grade boy each week, I helped him through his homework and school projects.  The time spent working on his math skills resulted in the improvement of his test scores.  Though he was years younger than me, we had many similar interests, especially sports.  We talked about our favorite players and our predictions for upcoming games.  He shared with me his love of basketball and his aspirations of becoming a professional basketball player.  Discovering he had never been to a professional basketball game, I took him to a Washington Wizards game.  I built a friendship with him over the course of the year, encouraging him to work hard in everything he did, whether it was in the classroom or on the basketball court.  The continuity of working with one child throughout the course of the year allowed me to build a special relationship with him.  It was gratifying to see the growth in both his academic and personal life.  The experience reminded me of my purpose in pursuing medicine., Faculty Directed Undergraduate Research In the spring of my senior year, I began working in Dr. Susan L. Forsburg's Lab on a yeast two-hybrid to study the chromatin remodeling factors of the SPN/FACT complex.  I screened for novel protein interactions between the gene products of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe cDNA library and the products of S. pombe genes Spt16 and Pob3.  The project included plasmid construction, their transformation into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the screening for expression of various reporter genes.  I became proficient in techniques of molecular biology including primer construction, polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis, and western blotting.  Though I was unable to find a S. cerevisiae strain that expressed the Spt16 and Pob3 proteins, I did find that the protein products of the Spt16 gene were altering and possibly inducing toxicity in the yeast cells.  My findings opened the door for new studies into the cause of toxicity.  It raised the possibility that the strains with the Spt16 gene had a greater metabolic need for adenine than wild type cells.  The results of my experiment were unexpected, but I learned to analyze the data and formulate conclusions.  I became interested in basic science, excited by the possibility of novel discovery and the challenge of designing experiments and interpreting data., Overseas Missionary Fellowship The summer following my freshmen year at USC, I had the opportunity to travel to Kunming, China to teach English language at Yunnan University.  I instructed a class of about ten students in written and conversational English.  After two weeks in the English program, my team and I organized a vacation Bible school for the children of Kunming.  We prepared Bible studies, crafts, and songs which were successfully used to reach out to about forty children.  Befriending many of the students in my English class, I had the chance to learn about the people of China: their culture, traditions and language.  It forced me to step outside my comfort zone and broaden my perspective on the world.  Even though Kunming, China was half-way around the world, I met people just like myself that deserved the same rights and opportunities.  It helped me realize how fortunate I was to have been born in the United States with all the luxuries and privileges that I had always taken for granted.  I saw the hardships people had to endure in rural areas, one of which was getting quality health care.  It was disheartening to find many weren't even aware of basic sanitation needs and preventative medicine that most Americans consider to be common sense., Joint Educational Project Tutor Working with the Joint Educational Project, I volunteered as an after-school tutor at St. Vincent's Elementary School.  I taught math to a group of fourth grade children and helped them complete their homework assignments, while taking time to explain difficult concepts and problems.  The following semester, I served as a mentor/tutor at Foshay Learning Center, a supplemental learning program, where I taught basic math and reading skills.  The most rewarding part of this experience was the relationships I built with my students.  During lesson breaks, the children would excitedly tell me about their favorite musician or best friend.  It became apparent that many of the children craved my love and attention because they did not receive it anywhere else.  My simple act of taking time to listen was filling a part of this vacuum in their lives.  I loved this opportunity to make an impact in their lives inside and outside the classroom."

    "text": "I have always had a deep passion to know more about the sophistication and organization of the human body. During my childhood, I was the type of a person who would take a few moments, in isolation, staring and wondering at my limbs and other parts of my body. What lies beneath my skin How is it that I keep breathing all the time without getting tired Questions such as these and many more created a feeling of thirst for knowledge about my body during my childhood.     I began to acquire a sense of enthusiasm throughout my education starting at the elementary level as I sought answers to these questions. I used to engage in medical conversations with my parents who are specialized practitioners and became exposed to new terminology, diseases and methods of treatment in a simplified manner. Being strongly impressed with the complexity and magnificence of techniques, as well as the challenges that face physicians in their cases I became inspired by the medical profession.       While visiting and shadowing my parents at the polyclinic in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia I learned a great deal about the field of medicine. I observed the way they treated their patients with respect and tolerance even though many of them were educationally disadvantaged and were difficult to deal with. Also, due to the high percentage of illiteracy as compared to the US a greater effort was needed to simplify medical information for the patient. I remember when my father, who is an OB/GYN, used stroke symbols in addition to words in order to prescribe medication to his illiterate patients. Also I was deeply touched by the humbleness that my parents had when interacting with patients or peers. I knew that this is an integral character that a doctor should have besides honesty and sincerity. Being at a higher intellectual and social level than many people, a doctor should have the motivation to achieve the best without being arrogant and carrying a feeling of superiority over others. I learned that a great doctor is not just a skilled professional but also a trustworthy and compassionate friend.     Furthermore, my motivation to become a medical doctor was influenced by my college experiences. After high school I faced my biggest challenge when I decided to move to the US to obtain a better education in medicine instead of accepting a guaranteed seat in an Egyptian medical school as an easier path. I was ready to encounter many challenges of a new educational system, but despite this fact I was able to successfully adapt and adjust to this drastic change with significant academic and extracurricular accomplishments at a much younger age compared to my peers. Throughout my academic career I was exposed in depth to some of the essentials of the basic sciences of medicine as well as the process of knowledge acquisition which further increased my sense of thrill to study and learn more within these areas. Since part of my personality was the urge to seek answers to questions that preoccupied my mind I was strongly motivated to get involved in research. Conduction of relevant translational research was an important criterion in selecting my HTLV research project. Through this project I felt the excitement of conducting experiments to test the success of synthetic peptides as possibilities for therapeutics against a life threatening form of viral infection that has no current effective form of treatment or prevention. This project involved a huge responsibility because of the expensive methodology that was employed and the high accuracy level that the procedures required. My involvement in research helped me to develop some qualities that are integral to a good physician, such as strong motivation to tackle problems as well as patience with hard work and optimism. Furthermore, it strengthened my analytical skills of data which is one of my motivations to enter into the medical profession.\t     Besides research, my ambition to become a medical doctor was shaped by volunteer experiences at the medical center. I was tremendously impressed by the American hospital atmosphere, with its advanced technologies and concrete organization of the different faculties and departments. I knew that my role to provide care to the people would be by far more effective in this system as compared to where I grew up. At the catheterization lab I was fascinated by the sophistication of the techniques as well as the artistic skills of the doctors performing minor invasive cardiac surgeries and their analytical abilities in interpreting X ray images of coronary circulation taken after contrast injection. Additionally, while working for the mail and flower department and the volunteer dispatch I interacted with patients by making deliveries in addition to discharge and transport. I couldn't forget the feeling of happiness that ran through me when I enter a patient's room with a nice bouquet of flowers or postcards from friends and family and observe his or her face lighten up with a smile. That gave me the greatest sense of accomplishment throughout these experiences. The combination of all these factors and experiences, together with my diverse cultural background and dedication I am confident that I can contribute significantly to the profession. Induction into Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma Alpha Lambda Delta and Phi Eta Sigma national honor societies recognize students who have attained a 3.5 grade point average during first year of college while enrolled in at least 14 hours of credit., Volunteering at Volunteer Dispatch at OSU At the Volunteer dispatch my tasks mainly involved patient contact through patient discharge from the hospital or transportation within the hospital. In addition to that I was also responsible for delivering flowers from the mail and flower department at the main medical center to the heart hospital patients., Induction into Phi Kappa Phi National Honor Society Being one of the oldest and most prestigious national academic honor societies, Phi Kappa Phi rewards academic excellence among students by inviting only the top five percent of juniors and seniors and top ten percent of graduate students., Student Instructional Assistant for Economics 200 I was assigned by the office of minority affairs to tutor an introductory microeconomics class to students who have difficulty with it. My main goal was to help reinforce the student's understanding of the course material and make sure that they are able to apply the concepts they learned instead of just memorizing and retrieving them., Research assistant at EEOB Lab at OSU My responsibilities involved lab maintainance and lab media preparation as well as assistance with experiments that involve the application of molecular biology techniques such as gel electrophoresis, PCR, and DNA sequence editing. The lab focuses on the usage of DNA-based genetic techniques to study conceptual and empirical questions related to evolution, conservation and behavior in wild birds and reptiles., Volunteering at the Catheterizaion Lab at OSU My role at the catheterization labs was mainly to shadow cardiologists and other medical assistants during catheterization procedures. I observed the technique of catheter insertion, contrast injection into branches of the coronary circulation, x ray images and analysis. Also I was exposed to different applications of the procedures such as balloon inflation and stint insertion besides the diagnostic use of catheters, Volunteering at the Mail and Flower department at OSU My role in this position was to mainly collect  patient mail from the hospitals mail department, sort it alphabetically and then deliver it to the patients. also in addition to that I was responsible for delvering flowers to the respective patients upon reception from florists., Invitation to join Golden Key International Honour Society The criterion for receiving this invitation for membership at the Golden Key International Honour Society is academic success and acheiving the top 15% of all juniors and seniors at the Ohio State University. Some of the benefits involve eligibility for member only scholarship funds of more than $400,000 a year as well as internship opportunities and many more. I am willing to accept this invitation and become a member of the Golden Key International Honour Society., Dean's List The dean's List recognizes full time students with excellent grades based on each quarter. Criterion for making the dean's list are: Quarter GPA 3.5 or above and 12 or above graded credit hours. I was named to the Dean's List every quarter starting since Winter 2003 until Winter 2005 with an exception to Summer quarter 2004 during which I wasn't enrolled in any classes. In addition to that in Spring as well as Summer 2005 quarters I had less than 12 graded hours that counted towards the GPA, and therefore wasn't eligible for the Dean's List, The National Dean's List The National Dean's List is the largest, most prestigious publication in the country recognizing students from all over the country that are nominated by their college dean. Only half of one percent of the nation's college students receive this award and get their autobiographies published in the National Dean's List edition as well as 3400 newspapers nationwide. I reveived this award three times: in 2002/2003, 2003/2004, and 2004/2005., Peer Reviewed Book Chapter Publication This is a Book Chapter Publication, that is currently in press. It will be published in the Proceeding of the 19th American Peptide Symposium. Publisher is Springer, Heidelberg Germany. The date listed above is the date of appearance of the conference manuscript. Publication will appear in January 2006. Publication topic is: Novel Retro-inverso Envelope Peptide Mimetic Fusion inhibitors as a Potential Therapy for HTLV-1 infected individuals., Research Assistant at Molecular Genetics Lab at OSU This position was a work-study opportunity. My main responsibilities in the lab were to prepare and sterilize lab media, as well as general lab maintenance without direct involvement in a research project. The activity in this lab focuses on the use of genetic, cell biological, and biochemical approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying oriented cell division and cell polarity development using Cells of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae., Honors program senior thesis research project This was one of the most important experiences that I achieved. I met the eligibility criterion for the Honors program at the Ohio State University and enrolled through a senior thesis undergraduate honors research project in the Microbiology Department.  My main goal in this project is to investigate into the possibility of developing potentially successful therapeutics against a life threatening form of virus called HTLV-1, which is the causative agent of Adult T cell Leukemia and Total Spastic Parapaesis. These therapeutics are peptides that are designed to mimic certain glycoprotein sequences on the surface of the virus such as P400, and P197 regions. In addition to that, retro-inverso forms of the peptides are designed and synthesized with D-amino acid sequences for a possibility of a longer half life treatment. Peptides are synthesized using a solid phase synthesizer, purified by HPLC, and characterized by Circular Dichroism for degree of helicity. Primarily a three cell syncitia inhibition assay is used to test the efficacy of the peptides in vitro. Besides my senior thesis I was also involved in the testing of possible peptide cancer vaccines against HTLV-1 using Elispot and radioactive Cr release assays. This vaccine research was additional to my original Therapeutic senior thesis project., Volunteer as a High school proficiency test tutor Through the College of Education I had the opportunity to work with Columbus public high school students in math and science subjects to help them acheive good scores on their proficiency tests. Most of these students were unfortunate in that they weren't successful in previous multiple trials and as a result have low self confidence even though many of them strive to do their best. This position was a huge responsibility since it dealt with delicate matters such as the feelings of students in relation to their performance on the test. Not only did I have to help them with subject materials and test taking techniques also I had to search for ways to boost their self confidence for the exam."

    "text": "Learning has always been a passion of mine. I have not always been the smartest in every subject, but throughout my education, not even a poor mark in a class could deter me from learning the most I could about that subject. This love of knowledge was ingrained in me from my childhood when my parents required weekly book reports from my sisters and I. I hated writing the reports but I loved to read, and I tried to read as much as I could about a variety of subjects. My favorite were science books, especially the ones that included experiments to do at home. I knew that I was destined to be some form of scientist; it was around my elementary school years however, that my father decided that my sisters and I were to become professional tennis players. Therefore tennis practice instead of book reports became mandatory. I still enjoyed reading and school, and I made decent grades, but tennis was how I was convinced that I would get into college. So I worked as hard as I knew how on and off the court and during my senior year of high school received an offer to play at Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky. It was an unexpected but pleasant turn of events that at Georgetown my love for science revived and tennis diminished.       I enrolled at Georgetown with the intended major of Biology/Pre-Medicine. Nothing in my high school educational experience truly prepared me for the type of studying that was required in Georgetown's science department but I quickly adapted new study habbits and pulled off a 3.8 G.P.A. my first semester there. As a liberal arts college, Georgetown required a diverse course load of all undergraduates but of all the classes I took, and did relatively well at, biology classes were my favorite. It was during my second semester at Georgetown that I learned a valuable lesson: the most important determinate of success in anything is time investment and hard work; interest in a class or subject is mainly useful for motivation. That semester I had spread myself too thin. I was working a part-time job, undergoing formal initiation into a sorority, breaking up with my fiance back home, and competing in my main tennis season. Poor time management caught up with me quickly as I began to struggle in my favorite class that semester, General Zoology. Instead of giving up one of my many extracurricular activities, I decided to tough them all out. I paid dearly that semester by getting the worst G.P.A. in my academic history and a C in my favorite class. After that semester I made a commitment to put my studying first. I quit the tennis team and eventually left Georgetown for Wright State University in Dayton, OH to better prepare myself for medical school.      Since I have been here at Wright State I have learned to manage difficult classes under pressure. During my first quarter here, my mother passed away and I opted to stay in school after only taking one week away from classes. That quarter I miraculously pulled off a 4.0 G.P.A. It was still difficult to stay in school the following quarters, but I knew that I was doing what she would have wanted. Besides being the poster woman for perseverance, Mom was the most caring person I have ever known. She taught my sisters and me the importance of giving by example. She would give, almost to a fault, whatever she had to anyone who was in need. Once, she fed a homeless woman right from our kitchen. She touched so many people's lives by simply listening to their troubles and giving whatever support she could. Another vital lession she taught me that I will never forget is the importance of staying young at heart. Children, to her were gifts. She told us that every child has their own unique talents and pupose, that a child's thoughts and feelings are the most pure and honest. Therefore they must be protected from not only physical and emotional harm but also from growing up too fast.       After my volunteer work at the Children's Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio, I can agree with her more completely. Children need people who truly care for them who they can relate to and trust. For these reasons I want to become a pediatrician. It will give me the opportunity to work with children helping the sick to get better, teaching the importance of good health, and along with that an appreciation of their own value. Pediatricians have a unique chance to give so much to a child's life. One thing that I have always dreamed of doing is practicing for free at least one month out of the year in impoverished nations around the world, particularly in orphanages. Hopefully I will be able to pass on some of the love my mother gave to the orphans I would care for. To touch a child's life in this way, for me would be the most rewarding thing I could ask to do. I feel that I have gained a true appreciation for life particularly in the past four years of my undergraduate education. I started out on my academic quest wanting to gain as much knowledge as I could, but I was reminded through my mother's passing that giving is the true mark of success.

    "text": "When I was born, I entered the game of life.  The match was between my goals and dreams versus the combined force of obstacles, disappointment, and discouragement.  I knew at the young age of five years old that I aspired to be a medical doctor.  Once my dream was born, the game began.  The score, 0-0.  Match 1: As a child, my health status required frequent doctor's visits.  From strep throat, to ear infections, to suffering from Bell's palsy, my childhood illnesses kept me in constant care of my pediatrician. Upon realizing the healing power of doctors I conceived the notion to become a kid doctor, which I later learned was called a pediatrician.  I strongly desired to be the person listening to the stethoscope, asking questions, and ultimately taking children's pain away one child at a time.  Score:  1-0  Match 2: As my life progressed, I constantly made strides towards realizing my dream.  I participated in peer counseling, volunteered, and maintained a job in baby care research and development during my summer breaks.  In addition, I maintained grades that would allow me to be a competitive candidate for matriculation.  Score 2-0.  Match 3: At the tenure of my undergraduate education, I was certain my academic achievements in conjunction with my experiences had prepared me for medical school.  Consequently, I was not a chosen candidate for matriculation.  Score 2-1.  Match 4:  I soon discovered that I needed to not only improve my learning skills but my volunteer and research experiences as they related to the medical sciences.  As a result, I enrolled into the Medical Sciences Preparatory (MSP) at Drexel University.  Attending MSP allowed me to refine my studying and learning skills.  I no longer rely on short term memorization, but thorough understanding and conservation of information.  I developed my volunteer experiences through involvement in organizations such as Action AIDS and Global Medical Training.  My research experiences were enhanced through participation in ongoing research in the women's health department at Drexel's medical school.  Upon completion of my post baccalaureate education, I am confident that I will be equipped with the skills required to succeed in medical school.  Score: 3-1  Match...Set...Game: Throughout my life, I have always been taught to believe in goals.  One message that was instilled in me as a child is:  If your mind can conceive it, and your heart can believe it, then you can achieve it. My mind has conceived this dream of becoming a doctor, and my heart has believed this dream for nineteen years.  Finally, the time has come for me to achieve my goal by gaining admittance to medical school, successfully completing the course work and residency, and eventually providing stellar health care to children.

    "text": "Do you realize that maybe only 10 people in the world understand how this device works were the unforgettable words from one of my fellow coworkers.  At the time, I was a graduate student working as a research assistant at Princeton on designing optical devices for communications.  My coworker's words were indeed an exaggeration; at least a thousand or more engineers could perhaps easily grasp the technical meaning behind our work.        However, on the worldly scale, I wondered how many people were truly benefiting from this discovery.  After many hours discussing this issue with my coworkers and talking with corporate employees in the field, I began to realize that our findings were very specific to our occupation, and affected mostly those working exclusively in the optical communications field.  It seems the ones who were benefiting most from our work were ourselves.  We were the ones to obtain the results and publish the papers, and we alone filed the patent to protect our discoveries.     After seeing this self-aggrandizement, I began to return to pre-med that I had started at Johns Hopkins.  Initially, I had entered engineering hoping to create new devices that would improve the quality of life.  I have always enjoyed working with and volunteering with others.  As a volunteer in the SHARE program at Johns Hopkins Hospital, we would gather mostly unused medical equipment, sterilize, and send it to third world countries that were most in need of the supplies.  What still strikes me is the Polaroid pictures that we received of the children and doctors that were so happy to have the much-needed assistance.  The past experiences in the medical field reflect the direct interaction and impact of medicine on everyday people who may not have the economic position to benefit from high-end engineering research.  These everyday people are the real backbone of the American workforce and their health and well-being are a critical foundation to society's progress.  Compared to engineering, the healthcare field is also relatively independent of uncontrollable economic factors; people will need health services regardless of whether the economy is in full bloom or mired in deep recession.      This desire to make a more direct and positive impact on people's lives, and reach out to those who may be in most need really drove me to pursue a career in medicine.  From the money saved as a research assistant at Princeton, I enrolled at Case Western Reserve and Akron University to finish the pre-med courses started at Johns Hopkins.  I also began volunteering at the Cleveland Clinic emergency department, and started working for Dr. Wilson Tang on clinical studies in heart failure research.  Initially working in database management and design, I learned to apply biostatistics using JMP IN.  We recently published several abstracts in the American Heart Association and are currently working on full-length papers on topics, such as natriuretic peptides in obesity and asynchronous delay.  I genuinely enjoyed shadowing the physicians, learning the medical standards and techniques from the emergency room.      What may set me apart from other applicants is the experience I can provide from working in and observing a large spectrum of the American workforce, from the highest to the lowest economic levels.   While taking courses to finish the premed requirements, I also work a part-time job to support a portion of the tuition and personal expenses.  Several people I work with do not have health insurance, and I strongly believe that access to affordable healthcare can create a productive society, since having one's health is an essential prerequisite to achieving fulfillment and happiness.  In addition, I can also contribute the skills I have learned as a researcher in the engineering and clinical setting.  When approached with difficult research projects, I take a holistic view of the project by examining all the possible solutions and angles to tackle the problem, and consider as many ideas and interpretations from other coworkers as possible.  Lastly, I can also provide the compassion and dedication to healthcare and service from the many different volunteer activities I participated in throughout my education.  I am completely committed to pursuing medical education and life-long learning, and realize it is a very long journey that requires financial, time, and emotional sacrifices.  My long-term goals are to become a primary care physician specializing in family practice or general internal medicine.  I would also like to pursue clinical research in the etiologies of heart failure and heart disease.  Through medicine, it is my ardent desire and purpose to have a more significant contribution and positive impact to people's lives, and affect those who may need the most care, regardless of economic or social standing.

    "text": "I originally started college knowing that I wanted to pursue medicine, but due to external influences I initially lacked the necessary confidence to do so.  The resulting uncertainties lead me to explore other areas of study. After some time studying other majors I eventually found a passion for the arts, and my academic performance changed dramatically.  After completing my first degree, I felt that despite my love of the arts, I lost sight of my long held goal to study medicine. Pursuing art returned the confidence I needed to succeed in the study of medicine.  As my original passion and a long held interest, I knew it was time to give a career in medicine serious consideration.  My cumulative AMCAS GPA may be misleading due to the changes in academic pursuits previously mentioned. Accordingly, I believe it is worth noting that I completed fifteen consecutive quarters of straight A's, which includes the premedical curriculum, while holding multiple jobs and doing volunteer work. Ultimately, I was able to achieve a cumulative GPA of 3.70 at my Alma mater, and graduated Magna Cum Laude with an Honors Bachelor of Science degree. A career change and a true sense of direction fostered a drive, which made these and other achievements, both academic and personal possible.  My MCAT score, though lacking in the verbal section, is strong in the Physical and Biological sciences. I understand the science sections to be the more important indicators of both USMLE performance and success during the first years of medical school. The performance issue in the verbal section is no doubt related to the time constraints on the exam and my tendency to be a meticulous reader. This clearly proved to be a great advantage in both the physical and biological science sections, but worked against me in the verbal. I have no doubt that my performance would have been substantially better had I been allowed more time for this section. Regardless, expedient but thorough reading is a skill I am continually working to develop.  While I am waiting to enter medical school I am continuing to embrace this field as much as possible. To this end, my most recent achievement was the completion of a major research project with the Molecular Pathology Department on newborn screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy. The resulting paper has been submitted for review to be published in the Clinical Chemistry journal. This work should help to identify affected children early enough to get them into treatment programs that could make a significant difference in both their duration and quality of life. I am also planning to transition to a new position as a research technician where my genetic analysis work on Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients will help identify their specific genetic subtype. This information will allow their oncologist to guide their chemotherapy in the most beneficial direction possible.  Such work experiences have had a tremendous impact on my interest in the study of medicine. Of the many experiences I have had in the field, my work in molecular pathology was just one of two that were instrumental in my decision to continue following this path. The second influential opportunity was my position as an intern in the ambulatory surgery unit. This position put me in close contact with patients and gave me the opportunity to learn how to interact with a wide variety of people in a clinical setting. My time there was spent primarily doing patient transport. Patients often became nervous after they said their goodbyes to their loved ones and we headed off to surgery. I learned quickly that all they really needed was some sense of reassurance. I was often able to help provide such comfort by talking things over with them and simply remaining professional and competent. This firmly impressed upon me that this is a field where the human element is paramount. This is evident at every level of employment in the hospital to some degree. In that spirit, I found that even a simple job could prove to be both beneficial to patients and personally rewarding.  I have developed strong problem solving skills in both the arts and sciences while earning degrees in each field. Becoming a doctor is an opportunity to utilize my artistic and scientific skills in a field I have always found fascinating. Whether clinically related or laboratory work, I've learned that I feel genuinely at home in a medical environment. As time passes I find myself more involved and more interested in the field, and increasingly enthusiastic about my potential to make a difference in people's lives. I anticipate hard work on the road ahead, and I am ready for the arduous journey and the rewards that will inevitably follow.

My duties here included DNA quality control analysis and PCR confirmation using electrophoresis, making agarose gels, making reagent aliquots, entering test results, and heteroduplexing patient DNA samples.  It was quite rewarding to see the inner-workings of a clinical laboratory and to take part in daily procedures.  -Morgue (09/05 - 12/05) Jeff Pelley, Chief Autopsy Technician It was so interesting I had to do it again. (see part 1 for description)  -Emergency Room (01/06 - 03/06) Patricia Williams This experience revealed the rollercoaster of modes endured by ER staff and patients ranging from amicable to hostile through intense situations to times of dead calm. My duties covered a broad range, but the most rewarding ones involved attempting to pacify the ill and injured in waiting room with their families or helping families find their loved ones.  -Surgical Intensive Care Unit (03/06 to 06/06) Theresa Todd, Volunteer Services Program Manager SICU duties were mainly managing the families waiting to see their loved ones., Intern -Ambulatory Surgery Unit @ The OSU Medical Center My duties for the Ambulatory Surgery Unit all revolve around getting patients ready for and down to the OR for surgery.  The duties include: showing patients to their rooms, getting them into the proper attire, taking them to surgery, and assisting them to the door when their stay is complete. Each patient is informed of the potential dangers of anesthesia before going down to surgery, and each absorbs the information differently.  Some patients are as brave as could be, but some others are nervous and scared.  This really becomes manifest when they say good bye to their family and it's just the patient and myself heading down that long, cold hallway.  The emotions coupled with the fact that they've been told that this procedure could be potentially lethal will bring some patients to tears.  Suddenly a simple patient transport job becomes something very different as the patient looks to me for some sense of comfort.  Being able to give them that comfort by saying just the right thing and simply remaining professional and competent can lend a tremendous sense of relief and comfort to a patient.  Those are the times when such a simple job becomes tremendously rewarding., Summer research: Search for mutations in the dystrophin gene My job here was to examine PCR amplified samples of zebra fish DNA to look for mutations in the dystrophin gene.  This was accomplished using the Transgenomic WAVE machine which is an automated gas chromatogram.  I performed the daily maintenance on the machine and set up the samples to be injected in the machine.  I entered each sample into the Navigator software by indicating their location in the machine and what exon we were looking at.  The machine would then inject each sample automatically at the appropriate temperature and plot the results.    As the fish DNA strands were pulled apart, abnormalities were apparent as deviations from the expected curve for each exon and temperature.  I then generated reports for each batch of samples and identified groups of fish within each sample group and any mutants outside of those groups.  I compared the results to previous studies of the exons, and each report was then catalogued for further reference.  When potential mutants were found I would then send them on for sequencing so that the exact cause of the abnormality could be identified.  More than 700 zebra fish DNA samples were examined, but interesting mutations were quite scarce.  I learned that it takes patients, many people, and procedural refinement to make a research project like this work., Organizing a public art show - Viewing the Invisible My role in this show was to take part in collecting and organizing artwork, helping advertise, hanging the show, and designing and creating a catalog of the artwork with explanations and credits. The images in the show were created by many different techniques and come from a variety of scientific disciplines such as chemistry, medicine, engineering, physics, neurobiology, psychology and other areas.  The images in the show were chosen because they had the effect of revealing phenomena or patterns which were not previously visible to the researchers who created them. The show was so successful at Hopkins Hall Gallery at the Ohio State University that it to Bricker Hall, and will go on to tour other cities in Ohio., Organizing a public art show - Translating Solids My role in this show was to take part in collecting and organizing artwork, to help advertise, hang the show, and to create a catalog of the artwork with explanations and credits.  I also had the opportunity to display on of my own holograms in the show.  The show was a joint effort between The College of the Arts and College of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.  The art and physics departments teamed up to present an exhibition of works primarily by internationally acclaimed holography artists.  The show included holographic transmission and reflection mixed-media sculptures, and experimental works produced by students and faculty in the Holography Lab at The Ohio State University.  The show was a great, collaborative success between both art and science., Shadowing experiences: Dr. Scott Melvin & Dr. Dean Mikami Shadowing with Dr. Melvin began with the second completely laparoscopic, robotic Whipple operation ever performed. The surgery went 2 hours over schedule taking eight hours to complete the intense procedure. Watching problems arise and solutions being developed on the fly made me realize just how critical it is to be able to think on your feet and take action. Leaving only a matter of minutes for a lunch/supper we were off to a laparoscopic colostomy takedown. Again I saw how fast action is often necessary, and how a patient's condition can go from critical to stable in a matter of minutes thanks to fast acting professionals. This was an incredible lesson as well as an insight into the endurance test surgical residents are put through.  While shadowing Dr. Mikami I observed a gastric bypass surgery, an endoscopy, and a lecture to 3rd year medical students on abdominal pains. Dr. Mikami was very thorough in explaining what he was doing while performing each procedure, and provided a very interactive approach to his didactic session with the medical students. I also had the opportunity to use demonstration laparoscopic instruments to make stitches and tie knots. I gained a new appreciation for the workflow of a surgeon and for the expertise they must acquire in a fairly broad range of disciplines., Student Research Assistant for Dr. Thomas Prior This position is somewhat of a continuation of my experience from volunteering, but with a focus on research projects.  The first project was to develop an assay to detect known mutations in the PRKAG2 gene. The aim is to assist in the diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and/or familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  I designed and ordered primers for regios with known mutations and  Other duties included PCR confirmation using electrophoresis, making agarose gels, entering lab test results, heteroduplexing patient DNA samples, and WAVE analysis., Shadowing experience with Dr. Bryan Fisher Whereas my other shadowing experiences involved senior level doctors, this one was following a resident. I am grateful to have had this experience because it showed what my life could be like for the first several years of being a doctor. I was warned that the hours are insanely long, days off are few and far between, a decent meal is rare, when you do get to eat it will be interrupted by a page and you won't get to finish the food later, your social life and sex life are severely hampered.  Despite all this, the people you help and the incredible things you learn make these sacrifices acceptable.  I experienced most of this first hand during that twelve hour day. The pace never let up as we went from doing rounds on patients, to observe an endoleak repair on a fem-fem bypass, to grand rounds, to visit with patients and talk to their families, to lunch, to be interrupted by a page, to talk to another family, to scrub in for surgery and clear a blockage in a patient's carotid artery, to an M&M conference, and finally to meet with all of the other residents and students in the group to discuss schedules and patients. I got a feel for the pace, sacrifices, and troubling things you can come across in any given day, and I can safely say I wasn't remotely discouraged from my pursuit of becoming a doctor., Research Asst. for Dr. Harris Kagan -High Energy Physics Working for Professor Kagan has led me to encounter many unique and diverse projects.  Such projects include designing and building course websites for Physics 596, Holography 455, Honors 455, and 555, converting documents to electronic formats for student access, helping to put up and advertise for art shows, designing catalogs for art shows, photographing artwork, machining and drilling aluminum for frames, building and maintaining computers for use by advanced holography students and art and technology graduate students, solving software issues and more.  Each workday is rarely the same and new projects are continually presenting themselves.  These attributes have made this work experience enriching in innumerable ways."

    "text": "It is theorized that everything in this world has its limits; amorphous ceiling caps in which there seemingly is no room to ascend. As a person who has experienced both the virtues and flaws of personal attainment, my attitude through it all has never wavered. Fevered by unshakable perseverance and incomparable curiosity, I have always strived to challenge the ceiling caps (or limitations as it were). The challenge in and of itself brings out the best in me. A healthy dose of research and a wealth of personal encounters has allowed me to gain significant insight as to how I can best serve the medical profession. Being of sound intellect coupled with my need to stretch beyond the limits; it is my strong belief that I will make important contributions towards this profession. The medical profession has become technically and socially complex in recent decades. As such, it is not easily accessible to those among us who may have the intellect but are lacking the desire to be continually challenged.               My strong desire to pursue a career in medicine was not defined at an early age. Instead, this goal was part of an evolution of curiosity which reached a peak during my undergraduate years. Soon after the start of my sophomore year at Penn State University, under the guidance of Dr. Avery August - PSU, Dept. of Immunology, I gained my principle foundations into an important facet of medicine: Investigative Research. The excitement and frustration of my research both compelled me to feel gratitude for the challenge I faced as a young scientist. This experience was instrumental in building mental backbone. Since that time I have been involved in the investigation of the role of Src family kinases in cell growth and activation of T-cells. The medical implications are certainly intriguing, to say the least. Evidence that these kinases serve to amplify T-cell activation suggests that targeting these enzymes would not only have implications for reducing organ rejection by reducing T-cell activation, but also in treating certain autoimmune diseases that are driven by Th2 cells such as allergies and asthma.              While my research in Dr. August's lab proved to be essential in honing my investigatory skills; my time at the Walter Reed Institute of Research (Silver Spring, MD) during my Junior year proved to be even more valuable. Under the guidance of Dr. Roberta Owens - Dept. of Biochemical Pharmacology, I assisted in a series of experiments designed toward developing more efficient treatment drug delivery methods to be used for soldiers exposed to chemical warfare agents.              Still, as engaging as the research was, the greatest my insight had to do with recognition of the great personal value that I had attached to my work. I experienced a self renaissance of sorts. Every emotion I had buried beneath scientific jargon and data was surfacing. The sheer joy of handling the research knowing that the work I was doing might eventually contribute to aiding those same soldiers that I walked amongst, fostered a deep dedication and commitment in me to the field of medical research.               Following my co-op experience I sought out the opportunity to deal more directly with people by becoming the TA for Immunology under the direction of Dr. Andrea Mastro - PSU, Dept. of Molecular Biology. The experience I gained from this endeavor helped to seal my decision to become a physician. As I scanned the faces of the students gathered during my first lecture presentation on vaccines, my mind was working overtime. I was silently telling myself that a professional physician would present this material responsibly, with confidence and comfort in his knowledge. Suddenly, I was feeling this confidence and it was then that my decision to become a physician solidified.              I am currently participating in a summer research program at the Penn State College of Medicine in the lab of Dr. David Spector - Dept. of Microbiology. We are working to understand adenovirus host pathogenesis during early infection, specifically within the nucleus. While here, I will also seek to assist others by volunteering at the Hershey Medical Center. It is my hope that this will allow me to appreciate firsthand the intimacy of patient care.              All of my experiences have ultimately allowed me to view the study and practice of medicine as an extension of scientific process to scientific humanitarianism. My view of the role of physician has been confirmed by my most recent undergrad experiences. While there is no cookie cutter formula for creating an expert physician, I now understand that a great physician must be willing and able to wear any number of hats during his career to benefit both his patients and in the long run - medical science. I have just begun to pick up a few of these hats and I now firmly recognize that my future journey into the medical profession is worthwhile and necessary. I am excited about the challenges to come as well as the limitless opportunity I will face in the field of medicine.

    "text": "In Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, the stalwart but initially uneasy Henry Fleming questions whether or not he will flee from a Civil War battle.  Likewise, I have often been skeptical of my ability to stand firm through the physical and mental demands of life as a physician; for while the medical field is not literally a battlefield, the challenges encountered can be just as formidable.  Every day physicians struggle with knowledge, technology, and insurance-company protocols to save a patient from the grappling hands of death.  This relentless pursuit is certain to deter many individuals from tackling such a daunting path, but of those who work toward this lifestyle, most seek the glory of being a hero, as young Henry does.  For me, however, practicing medicine is an idea I have nurtured since childhood.  By the age of four I already fancied myself a full-fledged doctor complete with a state-of-the-art Fisher Price medical kit.  Carefully, I would diagnose my parents' numerous ailments, but it did not take them long to get exasperated by the bad news -- or was it the minute-by-minute checkups  Undiscouraged, I proceeded to examine my more willing patient, the family cat, who was always in need of a hard plastic Band-Aid around the tail and a vaccination.  Yet, the most fascinating part of the kit was the stethoscope.  A heartbeat that at one time was only familiar to me by touch became, through a simple device, audible as well, adding another layer of excitement.  This revelation heightened my imagination by leading me to envision the functional synchrony of my insides and sowed the seeds for what would grow into a deep passion for science.  Then there were the occasions that I was the patient.  Most of these experiences were encouraging, but the one event that stands apart from all others is the time a doctor took me aside to show me an x-ray of my elbow and explain exactly how he knew I had cracked it.  His knowledge intrigued and comforted me, and I started to think about how wonderful it must be to have a job that pays in smiles.  Unfortunately, my vision of the medical field as a utopia ended abruptly in second grade when schizophrenia and bipolar disorder struck my older brother.  Being the naive kid that I was, I whole-heartedly expected that the mental hospital would return the man I knew.  But instead, he came home with an entirely younger personality.  I was livid, horrified, and pained.  I thought that had I been his psychiatrist, the situation would have had a better result.  Clearly my juvenile exuberance was clouding my better judgment, but my emotional reaction was an unstoppable driving desire to assist people like my brother.  Today my aspirations to make a difference are intensified each time I see him cycle between manic episodes and depression, struggle with his job at McDonald's, and endure criticism regarding his ceaseless eating and smoking.  Such history has undeniably influenced my decision to become a physician, but my career goal did not become a certainty until senior year of high school when my Advanced Placement Biology teacher began to illuminate to me the captivating complexities of the human body.  From that moment, I knew I was meant for a life in medicine.  Further coursework in college has served to strengthen my dream, even as some unhappy doctors I have met suggested that I run from the challenges of medicine.  Finally, like Henry, I decided I could not sit still and with a mental slate and pencil derive an answer.  To gain it, [I] must have blaze, blood, and danger, even as a chemist requires this, that, and the other.  My first taste of blood and danger came during my first year of college when I watched a coronary bypass from start to finish from just a few feet away.  Despite standing for eight consecutive hours, time passed unnoticed for I was stunned by the intricacy of the procedure and the basic fact that anyone could survive such an operation.  My consequent excitement left me sleepless that night, and soon afterwards, I began volunteering in the hospital's Anesthesia Department so I could observe more surgeries.  From liver transplants to neurosurgery, I remain steadfastly committed to making a difference in the medical profession.  Recently I tested this newfound bravery by shadowing an emergency-room physician.  From this experience and my discussions with him, I realize that a calm and steady demeanor is the most important key to performance under stress.  The world was a world for him, thought Henry after discovering his courage.  Now that I have my courage, I can confidently say that the medical world is a world for me and that I am ready to fight for my dreams, as well as the dreams of patients and their families for a better future. University Honors College Undergraduate Research Fair Along with approximately 25 other undergraduates (which as a group represented a wide variety of academic disciplines), I was selected to participate in a three-hour poster session to present my work on thirst to the general public., Ultimate Frisbee As a rookie in the Summer League, my team (Puppet Regime) competed every Saturday against the other 15 teams in the league and finished with a 7-8 record., Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior Annual Meeting At this week-long international conference I presented my research (in poster form) concerning the inhibition of thirst in rats to leading scientists and graduate students interested in eating and drinking behaviors.  Furthermore, I attended daily seminars in order to learn about the current issues that are most important to this evolving field., Brackenridge Undergraduate Summer Research Fellowship During this 12-week interdisciplinary program I conducted research on thirst and water balance in rats, delivered a one-hour PowerPoint presentation, communicated with other fellows about their work in the humanities and social sciences, and prepared both an abstract and a brief paper to summarize my findings., University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Volunteer Each weekend, I volunteered in the Anesthesia Department's workroom by preparing saline IV bags to be used for future surgeries.  At the end of the four hours, I was then allowed to observe such operations as coronary bypass surgeries, liver transplants, and the removal of an aneurism from the left frontal cortex of the brain., National Institute of Mental Health Research Fellowship For the duration of this 11-month program, fellows pledge to work a minimum of 15 hours per week in the laboratory, meet with their preceptors once a week, communicate regularly with an assigned clinical researcher, complete required coursework in the Department of Neuroscience, attend special lectures related to mental health, watch and participate in patient interviews at the local psychiatric institute, and formally deliver progress reports either orally or in writing about laboratory findings., Freshman Pre-Medical Mentoring Program In conjunction with this pre-medical honor society of which I am a national member, I meet with assigned freshmen four times throughout the semester to introduce them to the pre-medical program at the University of Pittsburgh and talk about personal experiences in preparing for medical school., Independent Research (Neuroscience) In this body fluid homeostasis laboratory, I have been exploring the hypothesis that gastrointestinal distension due to the accommodation of ingested fluid provides a rapid inhibitory feedback signal for thirst in rats.  This idea developed from the observation that water-deprived rats, when given access to water or a dilute saline solution, consume the same volume of either fluid in an initial drinking bout.  Unlike what is seen in dogs, however, inserting a gastric fistula into the rat and repeating the experiments reveal that vasopressin secretion is dependent on the concentration of the ingested fluid.  Therefore, the inhibition is not due to an oropharyngeal signal.  Since water deprivation is a chronic stimulus for thirst and induces both an increase in plasma osmolality and a slight hypovolemia (independent excitatory stimuli), I have been working with additional models that consist of only the osmotic stimulus to determine whether this hypothesis can extend to most circumstances in which rats are thirsty.  My research will ultimately turn into a thesis, and I am currently a candidate for the University Honors College Bachelor of Philosophy degree., Federal Work-Study/Independent Research (Pharmacology) Originally hired as a work-study student, my first responsibilities in this cancer research setting involved preparing solutions, keeping the laboratory clean, copying journal articles, and ordering supplies.  As I advanced, I learned more technical skills such as how to grow and purify proteins, conduct gel electrophoresis, assay, screen drugs, extract DNA from cells via midi prep kits, and use the Beckman 2000 and VPrep pipetting robots.  This knowledge ultimately allowed me to carry out small research projects during my two summers at the lab, when I worked full-time for 37.5 hours per week.  Since the lab was very interested in targeting the oncogene protein product Cdc25B for cancer therapy, it was my task to develop a protocol that would result in abundant, pure, and active samples of this protein.  In the following summer, I screened a Natural Products Library against Cdc25B and subsequently used phosphatase assays to determine the effectiveness of a given drug as an inhibitor of Cdc25B activity.  Good inhibitors were then investigated by other lab members to predict their potential as future cancer treatments., Tri-Beta national member (Biological Sciences Honor Society) Students admitted into this honor society must have taken upper-level biology courses, maintained at least a B average in those classes, and be in good overall academic standing., The National Dean's List Students receiving this award must have achieved Dean's List honors within their college or university and be in the top 10% of their class., University Orchestra and Quartet The University of Pittsburgh's orchestra consisted of a small group of both stringed and wind instruments, of which I was second-chair violist.  Group practices took place once a week for three hours, and public performances were given two to three times per academic semester.  I also participated in the school's only quartet, which received widespread recognition throughout the city via performances at campus events, weddings, and at Heinz Hall (home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra).  Both groups were supervised by music director Roger Zahab., Neuroscience Club This group actively encourages students majoring in Neuroscience to get involved with research and volunteering activities and also advises them on graduate school admissions and job opportunities.

    "text": "The headquarters of our medical mission--a once-barren shack now converted into a clinic on the outskirts of San Salvador--was teeming with mothers holding frail, unkempt infants and toddlers.  In the midst of this frenzy, I heard the piercing shriek of a young mother.  She raced into the doctor's office, a slumped toddler in her arms.  He was vomiting incessantly, lethargic, and feverish, and Dr. Hector, the medical director, quickly recognized the signs of meningitis.  I helped as he stabilized the child, administering intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but the situation was too dire for our limited services, so Dr. Hector immediately arranged for his transfer to the nearest hospital.  I calmed the hysterical mother and accompanied her there.  When Dr. Hector stopped by later and saw the boy was recovering, a look of utter joy and fulfillment spread across his face.   Three days later, the grateful mother, tears streaming down her eyes, returned to the clinic to thank Dr. Hector.  Afterwards, I reflected on how this kind, unassuming man had touched not only that mother's life but mine as well.  Here was a man who came from an extremely affluent background and could work in any elite hospital in the country, but instead volunteered his services to the underprivileged people of El Salvador; he was a selfless healer in the true sense.  Dr. Hector intensified my desire to be a doctor even further and will continue to inspire me.  My interest in the medical sciences has been long standing.  The intricate structures and complicated mechanisms of the human body have always intrigued me.  As a young child, I first realized that people differed in their capabilities and susceptibilities.  Why was it that some of the girls in my dance class took only one practice to perfect the routine while others struggled  Why was it that our family friend, a non-smoker who exercised daily and ate a healthy diet, developed heart disease at the age of forty  I found many of the answers as I studied the role of genes in my advanced biology classes in high school and later in college, but each answer seemed only to lead to more questions.    This curiosity led me to research as an undergraduate and brought me a step closer to understanding the genetic basis of human diseases.  In one of my research projects, I helped determine patient eligibility and analyzed blood samples for gene expression. I was thrilled to witness the correlation between specific blood proteases and the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture.  Although it was sometimes challenging to obtain blood samples from reluctant patients, the knowledge that we were slowly unraveling this aspect of heart disease was exhilarating.  I realized the importance of actively pursuing research that translates to the patient's bedside.  Medical education will provide the ideal setting, as the practice of medicine is trending towards an era where the concept of genetic variability will play a great role in preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic care of patients.  However, I recognized that medicine is not just a science, but an art of healing as well.  A clinical exposure at the heart hospital taught me the power of listening and compassion--the humanistic aspect of medicine.  As a volunteer, I was assigned to address patient care needs and make patients and their families feel more comfortable.  One day, a chance encounter with a patient's wife left an indelible impression on me.  I saw her pacing outside her husband's hospital room, looking very distraught, so I asked if I could help. Suddenly, she began talking about her husband's heart problems, their many hospital visits, and the financial burden of it all.  I offered a sympathetic ear and introduced her to Mended Hearts, a national organization that supports heart patients and their families. During my subsequent visits, I was delighted to see that she was much more optimistic.  It was fulfilling to know that a little empathy and effort on my part made a difference in her life.  The desire to replicate this feeling further strengthened my commitment to become a physician.  The lessons learned through the above research and clinical opportunities enabled me to see many facets of medicine; through them, I believe I have developed the intellectual curiosity, compassion, and perseverance to be a physician.  These experiences also helped me develop a personal philosophy regarding the value of human life and the importance of compassion and innovation in patient care.  Over a period of time, it has become obvious to me that a career as a physician will provide me the ideal platform to improve individual lives by learning and applying a body of knowledge that has always intrigued me.  I understand the challenges of being a doctor: the long hours, the rigorous study required, and the intense emotional demands.  However, if I can positively impact other people's lives as Dr. Hector did, then I know my work will be tremendously gratifying.  I am excited to begin my journey through medical school!

    "text": "Either due to the lack of time or an insufficient appreciation for George Clooney, I never watched many episodes of ER.  Therefore, upon enrolling in a clinical research class that took place in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, I had little knowledge about the workings of a Level 1 Trauma Center.  During orientation, the course director explained our responsibilities as academic associates:  to screen and enroll patients in various clinical studies carried out in the ED.  In addition, the message was clear that we should make the most of this invaluable opportunity to work alongside with medical personnel and learn what it means to deal with intense medical situations.  Within the first month, I had witnessed the death of a young girl in the trauma bay, heard mentally unstable psychiatric patients shouting profanities at nurses, and interviewed domestic violence victims about their history.  More importantly, as part of my work for the studies, I worked with nurses, EMTS, and residents, asking for medical opinions, requesting blood work, and otherwise observing the various activities that take place outside the patients' view.  I though that surely, these observations must be what the course director had spoken of as getting the most out of the class.  However, it took 25 minutes in the trauma bay one afternoon, two months into the course, for me to fully understand the value of this experience.  The patient who came in that evening had been involved in motorcycle crash, and we heard through the dispatcher that had been a lower limb amputation.  To me and shift partner, a pre-med post-baccalaureate student, this was an amazing event.  Even in an ED like HUP's, amputations were not common occurrences.  Excitedly, we made our way to the trauma bay, trying to find the most unobtrusive spot where we could still see.  Asked by a nurse to get ice, we hurriedly complied, rushing so as not to miss the arrival of the ambulance.  When Fire Rescue finally appeared with the patient, everyone in the trauma bay seemed to jump into action.  Residents, nurses, and EMT's swarmed around the bed and attended to the injured man while two more doctors tended to the amputated leg.  Observers like myself primarily tried to stay out of everyone else's way.  I was surprised at how unprepared I was to see the patient.  Not because of squeamishness or fear, but at the realization that this is likely the most important moment of this man's life, and the actions of the half a dozen people surrounding him in those frantic minutes have as much enormity and consequence as those of people he might have known all his life.  The excitement that infused me earlier had settled into a morbid fascination with how seemingly common and simple every life-saving action appeared--cleansing the wound, clamping arteries, inserting IVs, all things I had seen performed on patients with much less severe injuries.  Within the next 25 minutes, they had the patient stabilized and tests and an operating room ordered.  As the patient was being prepped for an MRI and a nurse removed the wedding ring and searched for the bag containing personal belongings, I felt rocked on feet again.  Here was physical evidence that what happened in that half hour, just another day on the job for the staff, changed more that one man's life.  Dr. Ben Ho Park, the principal investigator at my first lab position, said that he knew he wanted to be doctor because he could not imagine doing anything else.  Standing in a cramped corner between the basket of clean scrubs and two surgeons attempting to clean the detached limb on the floor of the trauma bay, I could appreciate Dr. Park's sentiments.  While I have worked in three different labs, researching topics from drug resistance to drug addiction to cancer and experimenting with new scientific ideas like gene therapy and RNAi, the satisfaction of seeing that patient wheeled out the trauma bay with stable vitals overshadowed all the excitement I felt when my work was included in a paper submitted to the Journal of Neuroscience.  In my current job as an interpreter at Kaiser Permanente, I accompany patients to a variety of specialties and as the result get to visit many different departments, none of which promise as much drama and urgency as the ED.  Still, the content feeling does not go away as I inform a woman whom I've known for 2 years when I first began working part-time for Kaiser that the ultrasound shows a boy, or when I am, with some discomfort, interpreting the symptoms of Down's syndrome to a first-time mother.  With no clear idea yet of what specialty will suit me, I still believe that medicine is the profession I would gladly devote my life to. The Penn Summit on Global Issues in Women's Health I attended a number of talks during this 2-day conference on women's health held at UPenn. Speakers from a variety of institutions spoke about topics related to the global safety and well-being of women., SALUD Conference for Student Leadership I attended this one day conference that consisted of speakers and workshops. Topics addressed include disparities in minority healthcare and outreach programs that alleviate these programs., Ricaurte Lab Research Assistant I engaged in research for course credit at the lab of Dr. George Ricaurte. My work focused on the pharmacokinetics and neurological consequences of ecstasy use. I learned to perform tasks like histological preparation, autoradiography, high performance liquid chromatography, and animal work. My work was included in a paper submitted to the Journal of Neuroscience in May 2004., VSA Secretary I was a member of the Vietnamese Student Association during my 4 years at Hopkins. Each year, I participated in organizing and working various events, such as preparing food for Spring Fair (2000-2004) and the biannual Pho Nights (2001-2004). I also acted as secretary and maintained the mailing list for the club., Academic Associate I was a student in the Clinical Research in Emergency Medicine course taught by Dr. Judd Hollander, an attending in the ED at HUP. This class consisted of didactic conferences on issues relating to clinical research as well as two 4 to 6 hour shifts a week of working in the ED. The clinical work involved screening all patients who come through the department, identifying potential study subjects, and enrolling patients who consented in a variety of studies taking place. In addition, per the requirements of the studies, students were also asked to conduct surveys, request and process blood samples, and obtain medical assessments from physicians. Aside from the study-related experience working with patients, nurses, and doctors, I also gained exposure to the trauma bay of a level one trauma center, where I observed serious medical emergencies., Medical Interpreter My employer, Hieu Le & Associates, is contracted through Coto Interpreting, Translating and Graphics to provide interpreting services for patients at Kaiser Permanente locations around Atlanta, Georgia. I typically go with one patient a day, each appointment lasting between 1 to 3 hours. Thus far, I have worked in most of the departments available at Kaiser Permanente, including OB/GYN, radiology, gastroentorology, genetic counseling, and behavioral health. This work allows me to observe medical professionals in various specialties, and to interact with patients and understand their concerns. I also worked in this position last summer, and during school breaks throughout the year., Bilingual Volunteer My main responsibility was to act as an interpreter for Vietnamese patients in pediatrics and OB/GYN at this county health center. I assisted patients during medical exams and interviews with the social worker. When not acting as an interpreter, I shadowed doctors and nurses, including a pediatric nurse on a home visit. Additionally, this health center participated in the Reach Out and Read program, so I also read to children in the waiting area and instructed parents on how to read with their children., Dean's List , Zeniada Production Staff This biannual Hopkins literary magazine publishes and awards student submissions of art, prose, and poetry. I took part in judging art and poetry submissions. As one of four members of the production staff, I selected works to appear in the magazine and created layouts. In my time with Zeniada, I also designed two covers for the magazine., Bloomberg Scholarship This four year merit scholarship of $26,700/year was awarded to me upon acceptance to the Johns Hopkins University., Park Lab Research Assistant This full-time summer position was for coure credit as well as for a salary. I worked under the supervision of the principal investigator, Dr. Ben Ho Park, studying the genetic mediation of drug resistance in breast cancer. The goal of my project was to create an drug-inducible cell line expressing genetic mutations typical of advanced breast cancers. This experience trained me on many molecular biology techniques and introduced me to the medical research environment., Herlyn Lab Laboratory Technician This was a full-time position I held while taking summer classes for the Master in Biotechnology program. The Wistar Institute is an independent research institute on the UPenn campus. I worked as a technician in the melanoma lab of Dr. Meenhard Herlyn, under the direct supervision of Dr. Steve Kazianis. My work comprised mainly of constructing plasmids to be used for characterizing the genetic progression from melanocytes to melanoma. One of the strategies we employed was the innovative method of gene suppression using RNAi."

    "text": "Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is also a love of humanity. Reflecting on my own life experiences, I realize the inherent truth that exists in these words by Hippocrates.  My personal evolution towards a true and thorough understanding of this took twenty-five years of experiences and studies. It is through this evolution that I have arrived at the door of a career in medicine. My studies in the scientific field have finally crossed paths with my current understanding of humanitarianism and its place in medicine. How these paths were paved and traversed sheds light on my true motivations towards a life as a physician.  Since the early roots of my education, I have always had a love for science.  Unlike a subset of future physicians, however, my pathway towards a career in medicine was not always so clear.  For it was only as I matured as a scientific thinker that I finally gained an appreciation for what science truly is, and its irrevocable place in the field of medicine.  Realizing that science is more than just numbers and facts, I discovered a world unlike any other.  Science has the power to give hope; it has the power to save. Importantly, as I have progressed in my studies, I have found greater and greater successes, affirming a true passion for my current pathway towards the study of medicine.  As a graduate student in the Master of Physiology program at the University of Cincinnati, I not only finished with a 4.0 GPA, but I also graduated at the top of my class.  Furthermore, as our curriculum included two first year medical school courses, I was the co-recipient of the Mark A. Snowdon Memorial award, an honor awarded to the two Master's students who achieved the highest marks in these classes.  These achievements truly reflect not only my capabilities, but also my strong desires to commence my studies as a medical student.  Such an opportunity would allow the furtherment of my knowledge of the scientific field, and particularly how it intertwines with the field of medicine.    Aware that such a continuation of my scientific studies could simply be accomplished through further graduate training, I turn to the words of Hippocrates as a reminder of the central importance of humanitarianism in the study and practice of medicine.  Reflecting on my path towards an understanding of the intricate relationship between medicine and humanitarianism, I find myself come face-to-face with my family history. My grandmother, before succumbing to congestive heart failure at the age of eighty, went through two open heart surgeries, one of which was accompanied by a stroke. My grandfather died of a heart attack at the age of fifty; I never had the opportunity to meet him. Nothing hit harder, however, than the unfortunate events that struck my father at the age of fifty. Unbeknownst to him and those who love him, he was at the brink of death. With blockage in three of his arteries, it was an awkward heartbeat that sent him to the emergency room. He underwent a triple bypass, narrowly escaping death.  Less than a generation had passed between the heart attack that took my grandfather's life and the surgery that saved my father's. I find it inspiring to think that the medical field had advanced so much in such a short time. Lives were restored; families were held together. Medicine is the reason that I can remember nothing of my grandfather, yet I can think back on the positive and active life that my grandmother lived. It is because of medicine that I could be standing, heart broken, next to my father as he lay in his hospital bed, and yet find myself camping with him only a year later.  Medicine has the power to give hope; it has the power to save.  Through hope in the face of tragedy, I have found the true interplay between the medical field and humanitarianism. It is this pursuit of a true humanitarian spirit that further instills in me a passion to engage in medical studies.  Also of central importance to my own realizations of a true concern for the well-being of humanity, my experiences as a volunteer in the University Hospital Emergency Department have been invaluable.  Aside from the excitement of observing the work of physicians and nurses in a true clinical setting, I have learned a great deal about the relationships between health care providers and their patients.  From the kind gentleman who complains of chest pains to the cocaine addict who has overdosed, the physician heals regardless of race, religion or lifestyle.  In a world of social biases, it is refreshing to see such unconditional altruism.  Indeed, this is a quality which I cherish, and as such, I believe that this calling would be an excellent fit.  As shown, my motives towards a career in medicine have been carved out of personal struggles, as well as academic and clinical experiences.  Importantly, medicine has shaped the lives of those around me, and as such, I wish to use my scientific studies to help further shape the field. I am prepared for the exciting, yet challenging, journey that awaits me. In accordance with the words of Hippocrates, I find myself equipped with the ability and desire to improve lives through the art of medicine. DNA Tech O After graduating from UW-Madison, I continued to work in the lab of Dr. Philipp Simon.  I worked semi- to fully-independently, continuing work on a project acquired as a student hourly.  The project goal was to obtain full-length cDNA sequences for genes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in carrot.  My responsibilities as a DNA Tech O included the following: (1) obtaining and aligning sequence fragments for genes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in carrot, so as to generate full-length sequences; (2) assisting in the collection and preparation of samples for evaluation of DNA; (3) assisting in the collection of leaves and plant tissue culture for lyophilization; (4) performing the extraction of DNA; (5) cleaning, diluting and derivitizing samples; (6) preparing and analyzing plant DNA samples through the use of electrophoretic separation; (7) preparing and analyzing plant DNA through the use of polymerase chain reaction-based technologies; and (8) assisting in the planting of seeds, roots, tubers and bulbs., Laboratory Intern As a lab intern at the Brookfield Wastewater Treatment Plant, I assisted with the lab analysis for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), pH and Dissolved Oxygen.  I was also responsible for general laboratory upkeep., Cardiothoracic Teaching Lectures As a student in the Master of Physiology Program at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, I was invited to attend the weekly cardiothoracic teaching lectures.  Such sessions provide physicians with an opportunity to expand their knowledge through the presentation of scientific papers, faculty talks and monthly morbidity and mortality reports.  As an observer at these lectures, I have had the opportunity to witness a process by which physicians may learn from each other, and from difficult circumstances that continually arise in the treatment of patients., Emergency Room Volunteer As a volunteer in the emergency room at University Hospital in Cincinnati, it is my responsibility to escort families and friends back to the patients who are being treated.  Other duties that I may undertake include communicating non-medically related information between the nurses and families, and simply answering any variety of questions that the visitors may have.  While the first five months of my schedule consisted of bi-weekly four hour shifts, I currently volunteer my time and efforts during weekly shifts of identical length., Dean's List At the end of my Fall 2000-2001 semester at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I was named to the College of Letters and Science Dean's List in recognition of my high scholastic achievement during that semester.  For a freshman to receive this honor, he/she must have carried at least twelve graded degree credits with a grade point average of 3.6 or greater., Student Hourly Dr. Philipp Simon's lab is concerned with the genetics and biochemistry of culinary and nutritive factors in carrots and garlic.  As a student hourly in his lab, I assisted Brian Just, who at the time was a graduate student pursuing his Ph.D.  I worked under his direct guidance for the first year, and then worked semi- to fully-independently after his departure.  At the time of Brian's departure, I acquired an ongoing project designed to generate full-length cDNA sequences for genes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in carrot.  My responsibilities as a student hourly included the following: (1) obtaining and aligning sequence fragments for genes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in carrot, so as to generate full-length sequences; (2) assisting in the collection and preparation of samples for evaluation of DNA; (3) assisting in the collection of leaves and plant tissue culture for lyophilization; (4) performing the extraction of DNA; (5) cleaning, diluting and derivitizing samples; (6) preparing and analyzing plant DNA samples through the use of electrophoretic separation; (7) preparing and analyzing plant DNA through the use of polymerase chain reaction-based technologies; and (8) assisting in the planting of seeds, roots, tubers and bulbs., Laboratory Technologist Dr. Stephens' current research investigates the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MRP genes and their effects on the ability of the respective proteins to transport drugs and/or drug metabolites across cellular membranes.  As the efficacy of thiopurine treatment for inflammatory bowel disease is quite variable across the patient population, such research has the potential to personalize medical care.  Throughout my tenure as a laboratory technologist, Dr. Stephens and I acted to partially design and conduct a large scale genotyping experiment that will, upon completion, identify certain haplotypes which will be introduced into a cellular model via transfection. This cellular model will investigate the ability of MRP3 to transport methotrexate across the basal cellular membrane.  During the later stage of my research, I was also engaged in the discovery of SNPs in the MRP4 gene.  Most of my work was semi- to fully-independent, as many experiments were carried out without the direct assistance of others.  As a physician scientist, Dr. Stephens hopes to eventually test his findings in a clinical setting., Mark A. Snowdon Memorial Award Established in 1987, the Mark A. Snowdon Memorial Award honors Master's students in the Department of Physiology at the University of Cincinnati who exhibit outstanding academic achievement.  The 2007 award was shared by the two students who achieved the highest standing in the two first year medical school courses, Medical Physiology and Medical Biochemistry, in which they had been enrolled., Election to The National Society of Collegiate Scholars NSCS is an honors organization that recognizes first and second year students for outstanding academic achievement.  I was invited to join NSCS after they received a list from UW-Madison that included the names of those first and second year students who were in the top 20th percentile of their class and had a minimum GPA of 3.4., Science Education Assistant The Center for Science Education, previously located in the Medical College of Wisconsin, provided health and science education to elementary, middle and high school students.  It also educated K-12 science teachers and adults throughout Wisconsin.  As a science education assistant, it was my role to assist the science educator.  My duties included setting up and cleaning the laboratories, answering questions posed by the students and performing other duties to insure a positive learning experience.  Since my departure from the Center for Science Education, the Center for Science, Health and Society has taken its place.  This new center has incorporated selected programs of the Center for Science Education, as it seeks to achieve its mission of strengthening science literacy and fostering public engagement in science and health policy development., American Diabetes Association Tour de Cure The Tour de Cure consists of a series of cycling events held across the nation to benefit the American Diabetes Association.  The particular cycling event that I volunteered at took place on May 21 in Madison, WI.  My duties on the actual day of the event consisted of getting to the site by 5:30 AM and assisting in the setup process.  I also served to direct the riders and cheer them on.  Aside from the  actual event, I also took part in a registration event, during which I assisted in the process of registering individuals for the ride.  I also attended a kickoff meeting during which we discussed the event and chose our specific duties for the day of the ride., Shadowing - Trauma Surgery This one-time shadowing opportunity was offered through Jennifer Rosichan, Director of Student Affairs and Recruitment Programs at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.  This experience allowed me to shadow Dr. Peter Muskat, Associate Professor of Surgery in the Division of Trauma and Critical Care at the University of Cincinnati.  Throughout the four hour time period, I accompanied Dr. Muskat through his morning rounds, and also had the opportunity to sit-in on a noon conference during which the physicians discussed an interesting patient case., Library Delivery Service When I arrived at Meriter Terraces, Meriter Retirement Community's Assisted Living residence, the library delivery service was a relatively new idea.  What developed is a service that brings movies, CDs and books to those residents that otherwise would have difficulties obtaining such materials.  Most Saturdays, I would make the 1 hour 15 minute drive to Meriter Terraces, where I obtained a list of materials from the activities director.  Along with materials used directly by the residents, the list may have also contained materials used for activities such as yoga and arts and crafts.  I then would take the list to the Madison Public Library, and obtain the requested materials.  These materials were then returned to Meriter Terraces where they were utilized by both residents and staff., Co-Author of Published Scientific Paper While working as a student hourly/DNA Tech O in the lab of Dr. Philipp Simon, I was assigned the task of obtaining and aligning sequence fragments for genes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in carrot, so as to generate full-length cDNA sequences.  Such data was utilized in the composition of a manuscript entitled, Carotenoid biosynthesis structural genes in carrot (Daucus carota): isolation, sequence-characterization, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and genome mapping.  The authors are BJ Just, CAF Santos, MEN Fonseca, BB Oloizia and PW Simon.  The manuscript has been published in the journal Theoretical and Applied Genetics.  The sequences have also been entered into GenBank, an online sequence database."

    "text": "Recalling the moments that have shaped my interest in medicine is a difficult task. Still today, memories of my grandfather's bout with kidney cancer or my grandmother's struggles with heart disease remain vivid. These poignant moments in my life tend to ascend as the most meaningful along my journey; however, with such powerful moments influencing my path through medicine, I often take for granted the substantial influence my everyday experiences have on my desire and ability as a future physician. As I have matured, I have come to find that the challenges and personal growth I experience each day are what significantly strengthen my passion and resolve to become a physician.   My daily experiences in patient care are largely responsible for the development of my character and passion for medicine. Involvement in EMT training, clinical research, and volunteer work has given me the opportunity to interact with a diverse population of patients and families. These interactions with patients and families have been mostly cordial; however, I have experienced some challenging interactions as well.   One such experience occurred while I was volunteering in an Intensive Care Unit. I approached a family in the ICU waiting area to let them know that if they needed access to the ICU, a condition update, or anything else, they could feel free to ask me. The family bluntly told me they only wanted to deal with doctors and nurses, and since I was neither, I was no help to them. I was stunned; I had dealt with families that were everything from friendly to angry but never had any been so blunt or rude.   Telling me this was a firm shot to my ego, and in the past my compassion for them would have suffered. Experience, however, has taught me that compassion is weak, if not anchored by understanding. As I considered things from the family's perspective, my ego was swept aside by a growing compassion for their situation. Their loved one was in serious condition; they had been living day and night in the ICU waiting area; and the uncertainty of the situation was wearing on them. In their circumstance I could understand why they felt any services I offered would have little impact on their situation.   One night the coffee machine in the ICU waiting area ran dry. It was in this nearly trivial moment that I was given a chance to help the family. While re-filling the coffee machine, I started a small conversation on college football that led to other small conversations and small favors such as fetching them pillows. In the end the family left the ICU without their loved one, yet in their time of sorrow, they left me a thank you note on the white board in the ICU waiting area. That thank you note touched me deeply and proved to me the importance of patience and understanding in strengthening compassion. Such everyday challenges and rewards of patient care have been a strong force in shaping my development, but they are not the only factors.  Other daily experiences in medical research and education throughout the past four years have also fostered my development as a strong medical school candidate.  My underperformance at Northwestern was a result of the magnification of uncertainties and bad study habits due to my immaturity at the time. Since graduating in 2005, my experiences in medical education and research have bolstered my abilities and confirmed my love for medicine as an academic discipline. In 2006 postbaccalaureate work helped me to improve my work ethic and study habits, while showing me that I was capable of succeeding in scientific courses like organic chemistry, immunology, and virology. Working as a research associate from 2006-2008 further improved my work ethic, taught me powerful new analytical skills, and instilled in me the qualities required to be a successful professional. This past year my development as a student and medical researcher helped me excel at medical school curriculum in the University of Cincinnati Special Masters Program. I was able to finish the program with Honors in all of the medical school courses in which I was graded against the first year medical students. More importantly, my introduction to the rigors and rewards of medical education strengthened my desire to be a physician and introduced me to the sacrifices that will be required. A strong work ethic and the lessons I have learned through these everyday experiences are the backbone of my abilities.   The rejections and challenges I have experienced in the past four years have solidified my passion for medicine.  I have not given up on my dream because I cannot give up on something I love so much. For this love I have pursued every enterprise in the last four years to increase my potential as a physician. I have no doubt that these experiences have greatly prepared me to face the rigors of medical school and will allow me to excel as a medical student. The character, passion, and skills I posses from my experiences in patient care and medical research and education will allow me to make the most of my medical training and prove invaluable to my success as a physician. Habitat for Humanity of Greater Columbus Volunteer During my time as a volunteer, I served as a member of the Thursday Night Crew at the John McCoy Circle build site. On Thursday evenings after work, I would spend 2-3 hours helping to build homes and clean up the worksite where nine homes were being built for Habitat for Humanity families., Clinical Research During my volunteer work in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Cook County Hospital, I shadowed Dr. Schabowski while assisting her in her clinical research.  Dr. Schabowski's work focused heavily on patient interaction and included a study on hypertensive emergencies and one on the alcohol consumption patterns of ER patients.  My responsibilities included identifying and enrolling eligible patients in the studies as well as conducting patient interviews and processing data. Interacting with patients at Cook County Hospital gave me great perspective regarding the challenges facing patients from lower socioeconomic brackets and the effects of financial constraints on medicine. Additionally, it greatly peaked my interest in practicing medicine in areas where I can assist the less fortunate., EMT Basic Certification I completed my EMT Basic certification at Columbus State Community College in October of 2006, which included clinical training and rotations at Mount Caramel East Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. During this time I assisted with patient care and was tasked with duties such as maintaining respirations for intubated patients during transfer and taking vitals. The hours I spent in both the Department of Emergency Medicine and clinical skills laboratory helped me to better understand the investigative processes required in clinical medicine. I thoroughly enjoyed the challenges of interviewing patients, diagnosing complications, and presenting cases to the instructors. My experiences at Mount Carmel East continue to inspire and motivate me on my journey to become a physician., Intensive Care Unit Volunteer In 2008 I volunteered in the ICU at the Ohio State University Medical Center two to three nights a week. While on duty, I served as a liaison between the ICU staff and patients' families where I performed a variety of tasks including escorting families through the ICU, communicating patient updates to families, and assisting the ICU staff. During my volunteer work, I was fortunate to interact with a diverse population of patients and their families, which allowed me to develop patient rapport.  Additionally, my work exposed me to the challenging situations medical professionals encounter daily while affording me the opportunity to observe the methods and strategies used to mitigate these situations., Research Associate My performance in medical school curriculum this past year is a reflection of the powerful analytical skills I was able to cultivate during my time as a research associate. During my work in research, I was tasked with directing my own studies and assisting with other studies within our laboratory. The majority of the studies I worked on involved studying aspects of cancer within inflammatory and transplant environments. That which most influenced my growth was a study I directed on the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in UVB induced carcinogenesis.  My responsibilities for the study included directing the research, conducting the experiments, interpreting the experimental results, and writing the research transcript for the study. Such experiences in medical research significantly shaped my maturation as a professional and medical scientist., First Author and Co-Author Publications References for publications in the FASEB Journal, Cancer Prevention Research, and American Journal of Transplantation are as follows:  Martin J, Duncan FJ, Keiser T, Shin S, Kusewitt DF, Oberyszyn T, Satoskar AR, VanBuskirk AM.

Epub 2007 Oct 17., Hobbies The two hobbies I am most passionate about are golf and cooking. Although I cannot claim to being the best at either hobby, I am slowly improving at both. Both hobbies are a great release from stress and allow me to spend quality time with the people I love., Cincinnati Special Masters Program This past year I completed a Special Masters Program in Physiology through the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. The program curriculum presented me with the opportunity to participate in the first year medical school courses including lectures, labs, and work groups in biochemistry, physiology, microanatomy, and embryology.  My performance was measured against that of the medical students. In each class I performed at an Honors level, placing me in the top ten percent of the medical class. To conclude the program, I am currently completing a year-long research thesis regarding gastric cancer and plan to submit a completed transcript this August. My participation in the program has confirmed my love of medical science and thus reaffirmed my desire to pursue a career in medicine."

    "text": "It was a hot, humid, summer afternoon. I walked up the worn out stone steps, which led to a pale-yellow mud building with a thatched roof. Adjacent to the building was a garden. The entire complex was enclosed by brick walls. This was the primary care clinic where I would spend the next 4 weeks observing the practicing physician and learning about rural clinical practice. The clinic is located on the outskirts of Bombay, a large Indian city. It mainly serves people from nearby villages. The region is poor and accessibility to healthcare is limited. However, measures are being taken by the state government to improve healthcare quality and accessibility. The driving force for change is a volunteer organization called Swami Vivekananda movement. The aim of this group is to improve the quality of life in rural communities. I was affiliated with this group during my high school days in India. I intend to work with them again in the future. In contrast to the modern clinics emerging in Bombay and other big cities, this clinic was modest. Hygiene and sanitation, however, were good. It was very busy with crowded waiting rooms and long queues being the norm. Due to limited funds, the physician had only 1 full time employee - the compounder who prepared and distributed drugs at the clinic's pharmacy. I volunteered to help in various ways. This included guiding patients in the waiting room, stocking supplies, regulating incoming supplies etc. The experience was rewarding. It made me consider medicine as a potential career. Later in 2005, I spent 6 weeks shadowing an Internal medicine physician. The clinic is located in Columbus, Ohio and it serves a culturally and a racially diverse community. It is busy with patients coming in every 15 minutes. In spite of the workload, the physician I was observing was very helpful. He gave me lots of opportunities to get hands-on experience. I took blood pressure, sugar, EKG, height and weight of patients. I also assisted with front desk and other office tasks. In the waiting room, I talked with patients on non-clinical matters and got to know them beyond the health issues that had brought them to the doctor's office. RL, an African American woman, had come in for her regular checkup. I took her vitals as she talked to me about her family. She was very proud of her son who had recently graduated from high school and gotten accepted to a prestigious university. Overcoming economic hardships, he would be the first person in her family to attend college. Inspite of a myriad of health problems, RL maintained a very cheerful disposition. At the end of her visit, RL was very appreciative of me being there. I had done little to merit such gratitude, but it felt great to have made a positive impact on someone's life. RT, a white male in his forties, was looking for help with his tobacco addiction. He had been struggling with it since his late teens. The physician counseled him on various smoking cessation techniques and suggested he start by using a nicotine patch. I realized that the role of the physician is not simply to treat physical illness but also care for the person as a whole. Physicians are entrusted with enormous responsibility and with responsibility comes reward. They have the opportunity to form deep, meaningful interpersonal relationships with their patients. The human element in medicine makes it a very attractive career. Medicine has its foundations on hard science. Over the last 2 years, by working in labs, I have developed an understanding and appreciation of the scientific process. My first lab experience was in Grotewald lab at OSU. I spent 6 months working with Dr. Malik on a molecular genetics project. I started by working in the greenhouse, taking care of plants and collecting seeds for experiments. Gradually, I assumed more responsibility and began working in the lab. I isolated plasmid DNA from tissue, ran gels, performed PCR etc.  Recently, I have started working in a cancer lab with Dr. Bloomston on an exciting project. The project focuses on microRNAs associated with cancer, especially pancreatic cancer.  MiRNAs hold a lot of promise for understanding the mechanics of certain cancers. They also provide potential new therapeutic targets. Cancer is of personal significance to me as I have lost close family and friends to it over the last few years. In my free time, I read scientific journals on miRNAs and cancer in an attempt to gauge our present understanding of this disease and also to look for new, unexplored territory. The information I gain from these readings helps me better understand the work I do in lab. I also have the opportunity to orient the direction of the project based on my findings. The autonomy together with the support I receive from my PI and peers has made this an incredible learning experience. I enjoy doing translational research and would like to continue doing so in the future. One of the aspects of medicine, which I particularly like, is that it's an intellectually challenging career. It requires rigorous training and a lifelong commitment to learning and service. However, medicine suits my interests and abilities. I am confident that I will be able to make the necessary sacrifices to succeed in medical school and beyond. Various community volunteer experiences Diabetes walk volunteer, Columbus, Ohio Duties included registering people, serving food, distributing gift bags, placing markers along route. Volunteered at a temple in Virginia for a week. My duties mainly involved moving material to different parts of the temple. Shadowed in a dentist's office for a week. I learned about insurance issues, patient information, procedures specific to dentistry etc., Research Assistant in Dr. Carlo Croce's Cancer Lab I am currently working with Dr. Bloomston (with Dr. Carlo Croce's lab) on an interesting project. The project focuses on the role of microRNAs in cancer (especially pancreatic cancer). Cancer is of personal significance to me as I have lost close family and friends to cancer over the last few years. I am thankful for having the opportunity to work in a cancer lab on a very promising project. The position is unpaid but nonetheless I spend significant amounts of time in the lab. My duties are numerous and varied. I am always learning new things. Currently, I am focusing on extracting miRNA from tissue samples. Soon, I will be working on cell cultures and transfection. Outside lab, I spend significant amounts of time reading scientific journals (mainly on miRNAs and cancer).  Overall, the experience has been very instructive., Math Tutor I recently started tutoring high school students once a week in Math. It is an unpaid position., Standardized Test - Pharmacy College Admissions Test I scored in the 99th percentile in the Jan. '05 PCAT. During the first 3 years in undergrad, I was considering a career in pharmacy. One of the reasons for this choice was that pharmacy requires a relatively short period of training. Since I had only recently moved to US (in 2000), I wasn't fully aware of the process of medical training and the vast opportunities available in medicine. I had a better understanding of pharmacy (because of relatives in this field). As a result, during my 1st year in undergrad, I decided to do pharmacy.   However, in the summer after 3rd year, I changed my mind and made the decision to pursue medicine. A volunteer experience in retail pharmacy made me realize that medicine is more in line with my interests than pharmacy. Medicine offers more involved patient care, more in-depth study of the human body and interesting career options (in terms of specialties).  It does require long and rigorous training but I see this as a challenge, which I am willing and able to undertake., Ohio State University Hospitals Volunteer I volunteered in the Heart failure department at Ross Heart hospital, OSU. The work was mainly clerical in nature. Nonetheless, it helped me understand and appreciate the things that happen in the background during a hospital visit. I was able to converse extensively with nurses. This helped broaden my understanding of clinical medicine.  I am currently volunteering in the cardiac cath. lab. This position invloves extensive contact with patients and health care professionals - including physicians, medical students, nurses, techs etc. It is mainly an observation position, although I do get to communicate extensively with health care professionals. I also get to see some very interesting procedures. It has definitely peaked my curiosity and interest in this field., Biological Sciences Scholar, Dean's List I was given the opportunity to become a biological science scholar due to my academic performance. Being a biological science scholar helped me network with peers and faculty. It broadened my opportunities and enriched my college experience.  I was able to take a biological sciences research information class in Autumn 2003 because I was a biological science scholar. The class informed me of the different research opportunites available at Ohio State. It was very helpful.  I also made Dean's List 9 out of 13 quarters., Research assistant in a Molecular Genetics Lab I worked with Dr. Malik on a project which focused on plant genetics. I started out by working in the lab's greenhouse. I grew seedlings in culture plates, transplanted them to pots, took care of plants and collected seeds from the plants for experiments. Gradually, I was given more responsibility. I began working in lab and prepared and loaded gels, isolated plasmid and chromosomal DNA from plant tissue, isolated RNA from tissue, performed PCR etc. I learned various basic lab techniques and became familiar with common lab equipment. The experience made me understand and appreciate the scientific process., Volunteer experience in an Internal Medicine clinic This observation/volunteer experience involved lots of patient contact. I took blood pressure, sugar, (assisted with) EKG, height and weight of patients. I was able to converse extensively with the patients, nurses and the physician. Dr. Yakhmi was very helpful and gave me many opportunites to learn and practice some basic clinical skills. This experience gave me a better understanding of the clinical side of medicine. It made me realize that I enjoy working with patients and that medicine is the right career for me., Observation/Volunteer experience in MRI Center This was an observation/volunteer experience in an MRI facility. Apart from shadowing, I helped with tasks such as informing patients via intercom about the progress of their scan, guiding patients in the lounge, cleaning up after spills etc. The experience was very informative. I learned a lot about the basic principles of MRI, the scanning equipment, interpretation of scans etc. The healthcare professionals I worked with were very encouraging and helpful. They provided thoughtful answers to my queries. I saw patients with  lumbar disc herniations (common), brain aneurysms, vascular tumors (once) etc. Overall, it was a great learning experience. It strengthened my desire to pursue medicine., Senior activity center volunteer Volunteering in the senior center made me realize that I enjoy working with senior citizens. I provided help wherever it was needed - I helped organize different events (like bingo, music, games, socials), setup pool tables and gym equipment, maintained the center and its adjacent garden, conversed with seniors, listened to their stories etc. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience."

    "text": "I wanna be a doctor 'cuz they cut people open. My parents loved showing embarrassing home movies of me to their friends; the one in which I paraded around as Dr. Nitin, claiming to know everything about medicine, was their favorite. One of the things I wanted to be when I grew up, aside from Batman, was a doctor. I even thought I satisfied the most important qualities necessary to become a successful physician: I was skilled at taking apart toys and fixing them, had illegible handwriting, and was extremely good looking. I had it all figured out- I would be a doctor by day and a superhero by night. Despite this early interest in medicine, it became clear as I grew older that my childhood ambitions were based on false imaginings of what I thought it meant to be a doctor. Indeed, it was not until much later in life, after a number of diverse experiences in clinical research and patient care, that I developed a true passion for medicine.  One of my first and most meaningful introductions to medicine was through clinical research. I initially became involved in research simply to fill a gap in my class schedule. What I was able to gain from this experience, however, was more than any number of classes could offer. As a research assistant and later as an independent researcher, I used behavioral and electrophysiological measures to study how a subset of stroke patients processes sensory information. The data sets I helped collect and later analyze were not just mere numbers, but the fruits of scientific labor, and the foundations for the experimental literature of the future. In the course of testing these subjects, I came to see, for the first time in my life, that I was contributing to the evolution of science. I was an active agent in scientific progress and the excitement I felt in learning firsthand about the cognitive processes behind disease sparked my interest in medicine.  While research gave me a sense of empowerment, it was also very humbling, giving me the opportunity to interact with stroke patients on both a personal and professional level. Aside from the pleasure I felt from carrying out my research responsibilities, I also found great satisfaction in talking to patients who later told me that the rapport we shared made them feel like more than just data for research. It was this sense of fulfillment that inspired me to further pursue patient interactions by becoming more involved in a local free clinic. This clinic continuously allowed me to gain new perspectives on healthcare and provided me with more opportunities to interact with patients. Most importantly, it stirred the same feelings of contentment I had felt in research, as patients would often approach me after their appointments and thank me for my sincerity and candor. Further fueled by this experience, I continued my foray into the medical field, shadowing an oncologist at a busy county clinic. This experience gave me the chance to fully appreciate the application of academics and research to clinical practice and patient care. It also helped to solidify an understanding of why I wanted to be a physician. At the end of the day, I realize that choosing a profession should be about what excites, inspires, and motivates you on a daily basis. My involvement in research and the relationships I shared with the patients I met in each of my clinical endeavors left me with this strong desire to pursue a career and life in medicine.   Unfortunately, my early academic performance did not provide support for my medical aspirations. Instead of making the most of an undergraduate education that I was fortunate enough to receive, I squandered early opportunities to demonstrate my academic potential. I showed up to less than half of my lectures, compulsively turned in assignments after their deadlines, and crammed for exams. I had little motivation to learn or succeed and it showed. However, upon losing an academic scholarship and on the verge of academic probation, it was my experiences in clinical research that emerged as my unlikely savior. In contrast to the lab experiments I had repeated year after year in my science classes, the research I conducted tested new ideas that actually had scientific promise. It was this realization that gave me a newfound appreciation for science and motivated me to excel in my coursework. Academics became less mysterious, and school suddenly felt relevant. Slowly but surely, research helped me to reprioritize my life, and drastically improve my undergraduate GPA from 2.6 in my first year to 3.5 in my senior year.  To further address my academic shortcomings, I also enrolled in a Special Masters Program with a concentration in Physiology. This graduate program provided me with the opportunity to take medical school classes and advanced graduate coursework alongside medical students. For me, my strong performance in the program was a personal affirmation that I was not only capable and competent enough to thrive in medical school, but that I was also prepared and committed to do it. I realize now that the entirety of my experience, from my development as a young naive student to a more mature young adult, has provided me with a solid foundation upon which to build a future medical career. Psychology Department Peer Advisor After struggling with my grades and social commitments during my freshman and sophomore years, I felt it was my responsibility to help younger students avoid some of the same problems I faced. As a peer advisor, I advised current and prospective students in the Psychology major on time management, study skills, creating a balanced academic schedule, and finding undergraduate research positions in the department., Clinical Observer / Volunteer As a clinical observer and volunteer at ARMC, I observed and interacted with Dr. Howard as he worked with patients, paperwork, ethical issues and general day-to-day tasks in a county oncology clinic. I also interviewed selected patients as part of an ongoing study to learn the reasons why low-income minority women delay seeking and receiving medical treatment of their breast cancers. Dr. Howard also allowed me to attend weekly lunch seminars in which physicians would outline how they addressed some of their more complex cases from the previous week to residents, doctors, and the nursing staff. This experience taught me the rigors of being a doctor, caring for multiple patients, and administering personalized medical care to patients of different ethnic and religious backgrounds., Engineering Technician As an engineering technician, I compiled, catalogued and helped revise a database of engineering and maintenance standard operating procedures and validation protocols. I was also responsible for performing environmental monitoring of controlled areas, preparing microbiology media for the growth and identification of environmental isolates, trending data on the environmental monitoring of clean rooms and performing inspections of media fill vials for microbial and foreign contaminants. Since Cephazone was on the verge of FDA approval and had a small number of employees, my job functions allowed me to move freely between departments and gain a better understanding of how the company operated as a whole., Cardiothoracic Surgery Weekly Conferences I attend, as time allows, weekly Cardiothoracic Surgery conferences presented by the UC Department of Surgery. Lectures are given by current physicians in the department and range from Morbidity and Mortality reports (once every month) to informal presentations on current operating techniques and treatments in the field. The lectures  have allowed me to learn about issues affecting proper surgical care, and have provided me with a more in-depth understanding of the field. The experience has also afforded me the unique opportunity to view and operate a da Vinci surgical system used for robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery., CAL Alumni Leadership Scholarship Award I received the CAL Alumni Leadership Scholarship Award ($1000) the first year of college as a result of my academic and leadership achievements in high school., Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) I received the SURF fellowship award ($2500) to independently conduct research over the summer on unilateral neglect, a common neurological disorder frequently found in individuals with lesions of the right hemisphere. Using electroencephalography (EEG) as a means of measuring neural activity, I attempted to test the hypothesis that individuals with unilateral neglect unconsciously perceive visual stimuli that they do not report seeing. The award gave me the opportunity to interact with other SURF recipients in cluster meetings to discuss research-related troubleshooting, present my progress in a ceremony at the end of summer, and run behavioral and electrophysiological tests on control subjects and patients., Representative of Undergraduate Research I served as a representative of undergraduate research for the entire UC Berkeley undergraduate student body at an alumni reception. In front of over fifty distinguished Alumni (distinguished because of their previous contributions to the university), I gave a speech and answered questions, alongside former UC Berkeley Dean Robert Holub, on how research and my SURF fellowship acted as a positive inspiration for my academic career and enhanced my undergraduate experience., Research Assistant / Independent Researcher In UC Berkeley's Cognitive Neuropsychology Lab, I studied spatial attention disorders (primarily unilateral neglect and unilateral extinction) and learned the behavioral and electrophysiological techniques used to investigate them. As a research assistant, I helped test both control and patient populations using electroencephalography (EEG), and learned how to analyze the electrophysiological data I was collecting. I also spent about two hours each week attending journal club, an informal seminar where lab members spent time going over recent journal articles pertinent to the research that we were conducting. As I became more familiar with EEG, I developed my own project (with help from the SURF fellowship) and became an independent researcher in the lab. As an independent researcher, I programmed and ran behavioral and electrophysiological tests on participants and analyzed the data I recorded. I also made numerous presentations to my lab group on my data and progress. Research stimulated my interest in science, gave me the opportunity to interact with the patients I studied, and first kindled my intellectual interest in medicine., INDUS Council Chair INDUS is a South Asian cultural club that represents one of the largest student groups in UC Berkeley with well over 500 active members. As a member of the Indus Council, I helped plan and volunteered at a variety of social and cultural engagements throughout the year including South Asian Awareness Week, the Hindi Film Dance Competition and Culture Show. As the Community Service Chair, I was responsible for coordinating service events between the club and local non-profit groups. In particular, I organized several service events with the local chapter of A Better Way, a children's foster care center. I also helped organize events for the National Gandhi Day of Service 2002 which drew over 200 students from our club to volunteer at different locations in the Berkeley area. My experiences as a chair taught me how to interact, on a professional level, with local businesses leaders and exposed me to the challenge of organizing large groups of people for planned activities., Co-Coordinator of the Fashion Show Act for SAAW 2002 South Asian Awareness Week (SAAW) is an annual event held at UC Berkeley showcasing South Asian culture through a variety of dances and cultural performances. The Fashion Show Act is typically the largest performance of the week and involves several dances in which participants show off traditional and contemporary South Asian clothing styles. As the co-coordinator of the Fashion Show Act, I helped choreograph these dances and organized practice sessions for the approximately 40 participants in the act. The practice sessions typically occurred 2-3 times per week with greater frequency as the performance dates approached., Student Caseworker The Suitcase Clinic is an all-volunteer medical and social-services clinic primarily run by UC Berkeley undergraduates with help from medical students, optometry students, law students and local practitioners. As a student caseworker at the General Clinic, I interviewed local homeless and low-income adults on a weekly basis and helped them obtain services that the clinic offered including chiropractic, dental, legal and medical care. I also helped to train future caseworkers who shadowed me as I interacted with clients. Also, when assigned to medical cases, I was able observe medical students and primary care physicians as they questioned, examined and treated clients for a variety of ailments. This experience provided me with my first opportunities to shadow physicians and act as an advocate for low-income clients."

    "text": "The baby is crying; what could I do He should be hungry. . . Yeah, all newborns cry when they are hungry. All I have is potato chips. He must want some. . . Oh! He is coughing! A nurse runs to help. I wait outside. My mom, a nurse at this hospital, tells me babies can't eat chips and he was asphyxiating, but he was going to be fine. That was pediatrics 101 for me and I almost killed my first 'patient' when I was 5 years old, but, as terrible as it was, I am still looking forward to becoming a doctor. I was born in a small town in Colombia where many people lack basic things such as clean water, clothing, education, and healthcare. There, I saw my dad struggling working as a doctor because many of his patients could not afford to pay him. His clinic was always filled with people seeking relief from infections, injuries from motorcycle accidents, heart conditions, and countless other ailments. It was the site of vaccination brigades for diseases like measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and poliomyelitis. There was a small surgery room that was used for everything, including the occasional eye surgeries by a doctor from Bogot, which was great for the community. I felt the gratitude the patients and their families held towards my dad and how good he felt about the service he was able to provide for the people, even if he later complained about how broke we were. When my parents separated I spent more time with my mother at a larger hospital in the city of Ibague. I realized that the pressure put on doctors and nurses is overwhelming, especially when the tools necessary to take care of the patients are limited. I saw situations in which there were no medicines or appropriate facilities available for the patients. Many times patients had to sleep on the floor. Others had to be sent to different cities because they needed special interventions not offered in our town. Even worse, travel was often by bus because there were only a couple of ambulances. During these years, I gained admiration towards my mother and her coworkers. She was in charge of pediatrics, maternity, and geriatrics all at once. She probably had 1 doctor and 2 nurses to work with, and they were able to take care of the patients without neglecting them. I got to see childbirths, gun shot wounds, the morgue, the psychiatry section, everything.  Since my mother remarried a doctor, the conversations at dinner time would be about triglycerides, cholesterol, eye surgery, glaucoma, deliveries, anesthesia, c-sections, and other such things. I quickly realized that working in a hospital was a lot of work and responsibility, but as I grew up, I started considering being involved in healthcare. I witnessed that the ability to improve someone's health and quality of life is the most rewarding calling. As the years went by, my interest in these subjects, the admiration for my relatives, and the wish to help others became my drive to be a doctor. I was able to see the profession from different angles, including a unique firsthand perspective and I am sure this is what I want to do.  At this time, I realize that besides having the passion to become a doctor, I have also become a mature person capable of working hard to realize my dreams. I say dreams because right now I am living a part of them. As a child I used to say that I was going to go to the U.S. to see my uncle, a doctor in Cincinnati, and that I would study there. Of course people laughed at the seeming impossibility, but now I have been able to realize part of that dream.   \tWhen I came to the U.S., I started college courses only after a quarter of English classes. Although I was happy I had been accepted so quickly, my first year of college was a real struggle and I did not do well. In my second year, I had to face the death of my stepfather due to cancer. I dealt with this as best as I knew how. Meanwhile, my mom endured a bout of depression and the very same day my stepfather died, my mother was robbed, maltreated, and harassed by her husband's family. I wanted to assist my mother in this difficult period and I dropped all my classes to return to Colombia. Thankfully, my mother's situation improved, and because of the grace of my wife and her moral support, I was able to return to my studies to complete a Bachelor of Science at the University of Cincinnati. As I examine myself now, I know that my upbringing and background leave me armed to make insightful and conclusive decisions about my career path and to manage difficult situations. The enjoyment in my experiences in the medical field and research in the molecular mechanism of intestinal lipid absorption make me realize that I will find satisfaction in the profession and the process of becoming a doctor. They have given me the character, maturity, and some of the knowledge necessary to pursue a career in medicine. Dean´s list After mastering English and struggling with family problems that led me to withdraw from classes, I was on the Dean's list in recognition of my academic performance. I obtained this recognition in Summer 2003, Winter 2003-4, Fall 2004, Winter 2004-5, and Spring 2005., Emergency Room Volunteer During the time as a volunteer in the University Hospital emergency room I had the chance of seeing how dynamic emergency medicine is. Although my primary duties were to bring visitors into the ER and bring messages to the patients, I enjoyed the opportunity of seeing doctors and nurses in action. Working in the ER also made me further realize that the number of people that need medical attention is enormous. I have also helped the Hispanic patients and visitors that come into the ER. It is lamentable to see how confused and sick people are not treated with the amiability that people deserve. As a future doctor I hope that the system will change so that the gap between doctors and patients in hospitals is not as wide and stressful for the patients., Social Worker I was trained in rescue techniques necessary for the evacuation of people during natural disasters. I was also trained in CPR. I organized the collection of food, clothing, and school supplies for underprivileged families of the area. My team was responsible for educating people about hygiene and sexually transmittable diseases, such as AIDS, gonorrhea, and syphilis. This experience brought me into contact with people in very poor social conditions that lack access to appropriate medical care. It gave me the experience and the opportunity to help people take better care of themselves and their families., Front Desk Specialist I worked as a Spanish-English interpreter helping the growing Hispanic population of Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. It has also given me the chance to learn how primary care works. I have been able to learn things both related to medicine and to the care system in the US. In this experience I was exposed to the difficulties of patient treatment, especially at the level of doctor-patient interaction (communication, cooperation with treatment, customer service). However, I have been honored with the gratitude of a great number of patients who appreciate the help I have been able to give them. I have also realized that there is an increasing demand for bilingual doctors in the community, which encourages me more to keep working hard and become one of them., Research Student Assistant In Dr. Hui´s lab, I work as an assistant primarily with two post docs.  My duties involve in vitro and in vivo experiments. The work in the lab focuses on the metabolism of lipids and how certain genes lead to heart disease. My projects have been centered on the absorption of lipids in the small intestine with the participation of Carboxyl Ester lipase (CEL), Pancreatic Triglyceride Lipase (PTL), and Niemman Pick C1-Like 1 protein (NPC1L1).  My contribution to these projects was rewarded with co-autorship in three publications. The first, Class B type I scavenger receptor is responsible for the high affinity cholesterol binding activity of intestinal brush border membrane vesicles was published in Biochimica et Biophysica Acta in 2007. The second, Carboxyl ester lipase deficiency exacerbates dietary lipid absorption abnormalities and resistance to diet-induced obesity in pancreatic triglyceride lipase knockout mice was published as an abstract in the Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology journal. The results from that study were also published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 2007.  As a medical doctor I want to continue my involvement in the development of new therapies and to broaden our understanding of how certain diseases work., Research Experience for Undergraduates In the REU program I had the opportunity to investigate the viability of Islets cells during the hypoxic conditions of tranplantation. We investigated the role of pro-apoptotic BNIP3 in islets and its up-regulation. The most exciting part of the project was the gene knockdown by siRNA of BNIP3 to enhance the survival of the cells during isolation, transplantation, and encapsulation. I received high praise in the poster competition at the Engineering Research Center of the University of Cincinnati. Based on the data we collected, the PI is pursuing a patent for the knockdown of BNIP3 in islets as a possible cure for diabetes types I and II. This was also a unique experience for me because many members of my family suffer from diabetes and it was rewarding to investigate something that has affected the people I love. During the whole time I was in the lab I remembered my step-father who died of pancreatic cancer. It was sad for me to know that an alternative such as islet transplantation could have saved his life, but doctors did not know about it in Colombia. I realized how important it is for doctors to keep up with the scientific literature and even be involved in research. The things that doctors and researchers can do for humanity are exceptional and I want to be part of this."

    "text": "Water was splashing everywhere blocking my senses. I heard people screaming, but I was unable to make out what they were saying. My heart was pounding against my chest and I was unable to take a breath. Lactic acid coursed through my muscles causing terrible pain. For a second, I thought I was not going to make it. Could this be true Was my brother right No, he can't be, I said to myself as I pushed through and slammed my hand to the wall. I looked up and saw my time, 59.98 seconds. It was my fastest time in the 100 meter freestyle, and I proved my brother wrong; I finished within a minute.  Swimming in high school taught me one specific concept: perseverance. Even though my brother said I was not going to do it, I persevered with absolute belief that I was truly capable of breaking that minute mark. I carried this quality with me through college to traverse obstacles. This has made me the person I am today. Not only did perseverance allow me to accomplish my collegiate goal, but it will allow me to accomplish yet another goal: becoming a doctor. \tI was exposed to the field of medicine at a young age by my mother, a registered nurse. At dinner, she would tell stories from the OR as my brother gasped in horror. I, on the other hand, enjoyed every minute of every story she told. I would even ask her if she had any more stories every night, because I wanted to absorb as much as I could. My aspirations of becoming a doctor were strengthened further in college during my first physiology course. The material excited me more than any other course I had taken to that point. From there it was set in stone, and I knew there would be hardships I would have to face to achieve my goal. But was I worried about the tasks to come Absolutely not. I knew I had the perseverance to achieve my dream. \tThroughout college I was able to handle my workload, both in and out of school, because of my perseverance and ambition. During my first two years of college, I was able to focus all of my attention on school without having to worry about any finances. The last two years I spent at the Pennsylvania State University were filled with countless hours of work and studying. In the midst of preparing for the April 2005 MCAT, I was also required to help pay for my own schooling due to financial issues in my family. Because of this, I took on two jobs and kept them throughout my final two years of school. Without perseverance and desire to do well, I doubt I would have been able to handle the work and stress that my coursework and jobs entailed. Because of the financial hardship however, my grades suffered slightly.  \tFor this reason, I attended the Masters in Physiology program at the University of Cincinnati this year. The program is designed for a variety of students, but my reasons are mainly focused around raising my GPA and to show my capability of handling the medical school workload. The program allows students to take three courses along with medical students: Medical Physiology, Medical Biochemistry, and Medical Microscopic Anatomy. I did extremely well in all three courses receiving either High Pass or Honors. This year gave me the opportunity to view my potential with a medical school work load. It also helped me further my organizational skills by managing my time to study for all of the courses. It was a very demanding program, but I enjoyed every minute of it. \tIn addition to all of my experience thus far, I have also shadowed numerous doctors at the Naples Community Hospital in Naples, FL where my mother works. Each surgery that I observed, ranging from spinal surgeries to full knee replacements and removal of prostates, deepened my passion for the medical field. My most fascinating experience occurred this past March when I was able to view the da Vinci Surgical System. The da Vinci is a robotic system that allows for much smaller incisions in certain surgeries. The one I viewed was the removal of a cancerous prostate gland. It was amazing to me that such a small incision can be used to perform several tasks inside the body including clamping, cutting, and suturing. Seeing procedures such as this one makes me wonder what the medical field will be capable of in ten years. I know I want to be a part of it. \tBecoming a doctor is not simply a desire for me, but it is a dream. I believe that perseverance will keep me fueled during the years of hard work ahead. I know that someday I will be able to break through amazing barriers, as I have done in the past. I will take that long awaited gasping breath, turn around, and see that I made it: I am a doctor. Kaplan Teacher/Tutor I taught for Kaplan as an MCAT, LSAT, PCAT, and DAT teacher and tutor. As a teacher, I would instruct a class of five to thirty students teaching them background knowledge and test taking strategies. Tutoring was done one on one and focused on the individual student's needs. This experience was very rewarding to me as I felt like I was truly helping my students. They would frequently email me with questions on certain problems and how to solve their own issues with the certain exams. I also, SAT Summer Study Coordinator Last summer I was Kaplan's SAT Summer Study Coordinator. I had to organize about 350 high school students into separate classes, organize their tests and write the curriculum as well as checking in on the teachers to make sure everyone was present and doing their job appropriately. That summer was a great learning experience and really tested my organizational skills. I feel that the organizational skills I learned that summer will help me succeed in medical school., Doctor Shadowing My mother and stepfather live in Naples, Florida and everytime I go to visit I always go into work with my mother at least once to shadow doctors. Since my mom is an OR nurse, she would ask several of the surgeons that she works with if I can observe surgery. I took advantage of this opportunity and talked to as many of the doctors as I could. I asked many questions including questions about medical school, being a doctor, and even about the lifestyle in general. The doctors I spoke with were very kind and willing to answer all of my questions. This experience furthered my desire to be a doctor because I thoroughly enjoyed being in the operating room and talking with all of the doctors and nurses. The atmosphere was very friendly and made it very pleasurable., Racquetball Racquetball is something I picked up in college and still play today. It's one of my favorite sports and I really enjoy getting my friends into it as well. I try to go as often as I can because it's a great workout and also a wonderful stress reliever., Running/Marathon training Recently I have picked up running and actually quite enjoy it. I was never very good at running and it is still very difficult for me. I plan on training for the Flying Pig Marathon 2009 with a group of friends. I always felt that if I could accomplish this that I could accomplish anything in life because running is the most difficult thing for me. It will be a very difficult physical and mental challenge and I cannot wait to test my abilities., Snowboarding Snowboarding has been a passion of mine for a few years now. I try to get out to the slopes at least a few times each season. This year I was fortunate to have a whole group of friends that we organized a whole weekend trip to a log cabin to go snowboarding., Rover Team Leader This job had numerous responsibilities. First, it was my responsibility to look over five of the computer labs on campus to ensure they were kept clean and all the machines and printers were running properly. I was also responsible for any emergencies in the labs to be ready by phone to help fix them. I was required to check in on other 'rovers' to make sure they were doing their jobs as well and report any wrongdoings. This job was my first job with any authority over other people. I think it was a great opportunity for me in that I learned how to communicate with people better and I also got the chance to train several new employees as well., Summer Day Camp Counselor This job required me to look after twelve 10 year old boys every weekday throughout the summer. We had other groups of kids and counselors as well and the counselors had to organize every day's activities for the whole summer. We played many games including dodgeball, kickball, basketball, tag, and we also had swimming time and snack time planned out as well. I really enjoyed this summer and getting to take care of a group of kids. I felt even better when some of the children's parents came to thank me at the end of the summer because of their kids saying how much fun they had with me., Patient floors volunteer This was a volunteer experience in the local hospital. The duties included discharging patients, taking prescriptions to the pharmacy, bringing biological waste to the lab, and transporting x-rays. Even though this experience did not involve very much person to person time, I found it to be a great opportunity to see what it's like to be in a hospital and interact with doctors and patients., Weight Lifting Weight lifting has been my favorite way to stay in shape since I went to college. I used to be a swimmer in highschool and staying in good health has always been very important to me. Along with racquetball, lifting has been a great stress reliever and I always look forward to it after a long day of classes."

    "text": "I have no singular experience that inspired me to devote my life to medicine, rather this decision is a culmination of all my experiences. I was born with an innate aptitude for scientific discovery, I developed sensitivity to people whose circumstances differ from my own, and I feel there is no better way for me to contribute to society than to merge my intellectual abilities with my humanistic characteristics. Since I was a young child mixing up concoctions in the kitchen, catching as many species of insects I could find, and learning about the animal tracks I found in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, I have had a curiosity about the world around me. My mother often embarrasses me with a story from my first trip to Disney World: I seemed more interested in the mechanics of the rides than the actual thrill of movement that the rides provided. Additionally, growing up I had the good fortune to experience a number of cultures very different from my own. What impacted me most were the disparities between our worlds, especially those in health care.   While only five, my parents provided me with my first exposure to a different culture when they took me to Thailand. I recall our expedition to a small, remote village. Our guide led us to a place only accessible on the backs of elephants, where the villagers crowded around me to touch my white-blonde hair and young boys offered me locusts caught with sap on the tip of 20-foot poles. Later, I continued my travels to France, Italy, Great Britain, and Mexico. I appreciated these societies more as I was old enough to process how culture impacts our world, which led me to study Classics in order to better understand from where my own culture began.  Exposure to different cultures has increased my sensitivity to cultural competence. This understanding is important in the art of practicing medicine because to treat patients effectively, I recognize I must be able to appreciate them individually. To develop this skill further, I am currently working in three different hospitals, each providing me with exposure to a unique set of patients. My volunteer work at Robinson Memorial Hospital exposes me to rural Ohio, whose patients have different needs from those in urban Cleveland, at MetroHealth Medical Center. Still different is the aging population I see at the VA Medical Center. Each of these facilities focuses on providing care to disadvantaged populations, a mission very important to me.  I have spent the last year and a half on a Case Western Reserve University research project aimed at improving the quality of life for advanced cancer patients and their caregivers. Working on this NIH-sponsored R01 study has allowed me to see a broad range of differing aspects of research and the medical field. The most rewarding experiences I've had were screening patients for eligibility, working on a grant proposal and manuscript, and talking one-on-one with patients and families each day. In addition, conducting telephone interviews enhances my listening and perception skills. By screening patients and performing chart reviews on our subjects, I learn a great deal about the science of medicine. I read everything from the patient's background information, to their clinic appointment notes, to specific reports like PET scans and biopsies. This fuels my natural curiosity and often I spend hours outside of work researching the difference between things like lung cancer and esophageal cancer, non-small cell and small cell disease, or cisplatin and paclitaxel. Especially interesting to me are the chemotherapeutic agents as my dream as a child was to design pharmaceuticals. However, as I gained more life experience, my desire to get out of the lab and work with people increased as I noticed I have a natural ability to read people's body language and the intuitive meaning behind their spoken words.  While the aforementioned skill for predicting intents and desires may be important in many professions, I know medicine is the place I want to apply my skill. The most frustrating thing about my position as a research assistant is seeing a patient suffering and not knowing what I can do to help. I talk with patients and families every day whose situations break my heart and just as their physicians help these people now, with a medical degree, I will be able to help many others like them.  I have had a range of interesting experiences including travel, Classical Studies, and my positions in industry and clinical research, each of which have impacted my desire to pursue medicine. My fellowship in Ancient Greek taught me to appreciate complex subjects so that now I am prepared to appreciate the complexity of the human body and its systems. My voyages abroad have taught me appreciation of culture and how it impacts the world. I spent time working as a microbiologist in the industrial field which showed me that I fully appreciate science most when it is applied to medicine outside of a lab. And finally, my clinical experiences have solidified my decision to pursue a medical degree. I look forward to learning the science, meeting the patients, and making a worthwhile contribution to our global society through the practice of medicine. Manager of Papa John's After one week's work at this Papa John's, I started training to be a shift manager, working from 5pm until as late as 3:30am and usually by myself inside the store after 11pm.  This position taught me responsibility, commitment, and physical stamina, a trait I'm sure to utilize as a physician-in-training., Patient Companion After spending a year in end-of-life care research, I wanted to be more directly involved in patient care.  Thus I volunteer as a patient companion to area patients enrolled in hospice through In-House.  This entails visiting patients at their residence, most often a long-term care or skilled nursing facility, and providing companionship, assistance with meals, or socialization.  This experience has taught me patience and sensitivity to an individual's dying process., Cornell College Republicans As a member of the Cornell chapter of College Republicans, I attended and took part in meetings, discussions, and debates regarding current issues.   This provided me a forum to share my views on issues that I had researched for personal edification and to hear the voices of not only my fellow conservatives, but also those of the prominent liberal groups on campus.  This experience taught me to listen to opinions that differ from my own with respect and intent to learn from them., Special Events Volunteer Hale Farm and Village is a living museum of frontier life in Connecticut's Western Reserve.  This summer I am volunteering for all special event weekends and my duties vary each time.  I loved Hale Farm growing up and appreciate the opportunity to share my fondness for colonial crafts and frontier life with our visitors.  In this experience, I work a great deal with children, something I have not been able to do in any other aspect of my life, thus I value this opportunity greatly to learn how best to communicate with them.  Through this I have learned patience, commitment, and leadership., Dean's List I achieved Dean's List my second semester at Cornell with a 3.894 GPA while taking 18 credits.  I repeated this feat my last semester at Cornell with a 4.0 GPA with 14 credits (Fall 2006)., Vice President and Treasurer of Kai ta Loipa I became Treasurer and acting Vice President of Kai Ta Loipa Classics Society my senior year.  This group is devoted to bringing together members of the Classics department including faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates in social and educational settings.  We played as an intramural softball team, held dinners during which we tried to speak only in Latin, and fostered a sense of community for one of the smallest majors on campus.  Along with my President, I founded the Cornell Chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, the national classics society.  Though I was unable to be inducted since new chapters are named only in the spring and I graduated early, I felt it was important that a school like Cornell have this group on campus.  Through this experience I learned leadership and responsibility while still having a great time., Research Assistant II I currently work as a Research Assistant for Case Western Reserve University.  The project I work on studies supportive care and end-of-life issues in advanced cancer patients and their care-givers.  I have many responsibilities including: screening and enrolling eligible patients, patient and family interviews (including After Death interviews), data entry and cleaning, grant preparation, IRB correspondence and submissions, and manuscript preparation.  This position has provided me with experience in many areas of medicine and research and has allowed me to take the lead on a number of projects including student training, quality assurance of our consent process, and the research for an argument that allowed us to enroll a new set of patients.  This project is a precursor for research I hope to do in the future.  Through this work I have learned how to function effectively as part of research team, how to better communicate with patients and families, as well as independence, sensitivity, leadership, and ethical human subject research techniques., Club Field Hockey I planned to walk on to Cornell's varsity team after playing in high school where my hockey career was cut short due to illness.  Unfortunately due to a change in coaching staff, Cornell did not accept any walk-on players the year that I entered.  I found Cornell's club team and enjoyed the opportunity to play with men who grew up with the sport in other countries.  I learned a great deal about commitment, time management, and flexibility in one's plans., Microbiology Lab Technician and Quality Assurance Technician I worked as a Microbiologist and Quality Assurance Laboratory Technician at a company that mixes and packages chemical cleansers for larger companies like Proctor and Gamble, Church and Dwight, and SC Johnson.  Through this experience, I had the opportunity to practice microbiology and basic chemistry lab techniques in an industry setting.  While I greatly enjoyed some of the things I learned in the micro lab, I ultimately learned that I do not want to devote my professional life to a position in industrial manufacturing., Access Services Representative I worked as an Access Services Representative in Olin and Uris libraries assisting at the circulation desk.  The position entailed sorting returned books, customer service, and retrieving and delivering requested materials.  This position taught me incredible attention to detail, a trait for which I have been praised in my current position and I will carry through to medical school., Emergency Department and Nursing Unit Volunteer Robinson Memorial Hospital is a rural, community hospital located in Ravenna, Ohio (Portage County).  I started working on the surgical ward at the nurses station doing small tasks for them including stocking the cabinets in patient rooms, taking samples to the lab, and transporting patients to their cars when discharged.  And I now currently work at the patient information desk in the Emergency Department where I check patients in, bring them back to the exam room, and assist family members.  This experience has provided me additional exposure to a different clinical setting with its own unique pace, structure, and patient population.  I have learned respect, confidentiality, and crisis management from my time at Robinson., Kanders-Townsend Fellowship This fellowship is usually awarded to two classics students each summer, one to study Latin and one to study Greek.  Based on my superior performance in my Latin courses, I was awarded the opportunity to study Greek over the summer, earning 6 credits in 6 weeks--no surprise the course was entitled 'Intensive Ancient Greek.'  From this greuling experience, I learned discipline and taxed the language part of my brain to the maximum., Shadow experience This was my first exposure to a clinical setting and solidified for me my pursuit of the medical profession.  I experienced tumor board discussions, observed the resection of a tumor-laden knee joint, and saw many different patients in an outpatient setting.  As a result of this experience as well as my current work, I am very interested in pursuing oncology as a specialty., The Role of Primary Care Physicians in Adavanced Cancer Care This work was presented at a conference entitled Geriatric Oncology and Primary Care: Promoting Partnerships in Practice and Research which took place as the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center.  The manuscript on which this presentation is based will be submitted for publication and has been named in the progress report to our sponsor, the National Institutes of Health.  I  enjoyed working on this project and attending the conference in April, especially hearing other perspectives on this important subject.  Our manuscript (authors are Elizabeth O'Toole, MD; Mary Step, PhD, and myself) examines the effectiveness of communication between patients and physicians and the larger study, Aging and Supportive Care of Advanced Cancer, uses an intervention which includes counseling patients to ask the right questions to get the answers they need or want from their providers.  In the future, I hope to study how physicians adapt their communication style to individual patients and how it may be possible to teach physicians to communicate sensitively and effectively to individual patients., Alpha Epsilon Delta While a member of this national premedical honors society, I had the opportunity to participate in community service days and our mentoring program.  I enjoyed the opportunity and look forward to helping and teaching students as I progress through medical school and beyond."

    "text": "What makes someone want to become a doctor For some, it is a life changing event which opens their eyes to the world of medicine. For others, it is just expected; perhaps many family members are doctors and they are next. Perhaps they did so well academically that pursuing a challenge, like medicine, seems only logical. Some have always desired to pursue medicine, but for others, a career as a physician is a natural outcome of their personal evolution - a summation of their life experiences. I think the latter best describes how I came to pursue a career in medicine: it is the perfect fit for my character. Throughout my experiences with doctors, whether working at a pathology lab, shadowing a pediatric neurosurgeon, or being with my brother and uncle, both doctors, I have observed the qualities of a successful physician. These are qualities which I possess: empathy and compassion, a sense of responsibility, and perseverance. Such qualities are not found in textbooks, but develop as a part of one's character. Empathy and compassion are important traits for a physician. In order to develop the trust that must exist between a doctor and his patients, he must be able to identify with their pain and suffering. Patients must trust that the doctor is compassionate and understands their complaints and desires. When I am told of a problem someone is having, the first thought that goes through my mind is how I would feel in that person's shoes and how I would go about seeking a resolution. I empathize with that person, whether it is simply a friend telling me about a bad day at work or an unfavorable diagnosis for a patient at the hospital I worked at, and I yearn for the ability to help them. As part of my job in the pathology lab, I routinely saw very interesting surgical specimens, medical procedures, and even assisted on autopsies, and they always brought out sympathy for the patient and their family at the time. As a physician, I would experience a similar process with my own patients, but I would then be in a position to help. I would serve them better with my ability to guide them through difficult times. A sense of responsibility toward patient care focuses a physician on helping a patient in every way, even if it involves significant personal sacrifice to achieve a successful outcome. My parents taught me this while I was growing up; one of many important values they instilled in me. School and work continued to improve that sense as I moved on to challenging jobs and earned two degrees. Belief in this sentiment also means taking responsibility for mistakes and failures. Prior to my first application to medical school, circumstances in my life during my college years, including problems at home and an unorthodox work schedule, led to a temporary lack of focus on my goal. Yet my desire never wavered and in fact grew stronger throughout the years as I continued my exploration of the medical profession. However, I was ultimately responsible for this lapse and now feel that I have re-focused my drive more than ever. This is reflected in my recent academic success and my continued exposure to the medical field. I plan to continue building on this quality when I enter medical school and face a new array of responsibilities. Finally, not only does becoming a physician take perseverance, but it also requires a strong commitment and dedication to succeed in a profession full of failure as well as success. Despite setbacks entering medicine or unfavorable outcomes that are inevitable in any physician's practice, the individuals that are nonetheless dedicated to continuing on the path are the ones that become successful doctors. Since the last time I applied, I have dedicated myself to improving my credentials. I entered the MS in Physiology program at the University of Cincinnati, a year-long special masters program.  It allowed me to take medical courses with the current first-year medical class as well as graduate physiology courses and I performed very well in all of them. The program concludes with the completion of a literature research manuscript. Most importantly, however, I learned many techniques regarding time management and study skills that will help me in medical school. This has afforded me a substantial increase in confidence and my performance so far has confirmed to me that I will indeed be successful in a medical school curriculum. I know I have not had the smoothest path to medicine. However, I have overcome all the challenges in my way, and I believe that they have made me stronger. All of my experiences have contributed to who I am as a person today and I have learned from both the positive and negative ones. They have given me skills that will help me as a doctor, from the study habits I developed throughout my higher education, to the communication skills I learned working and interacting with thousands of unique personalities from around the world at Disneyland for three years in college. I know that I have what is needed to succeed as a physician. With attributes that have prepared me for medicine and a fund of knowledge acquired from school and clinical experiences, medicine is calling to me louder than ever. I am ready, I am motivated, and I look forward to the experience. Emergency Dept. and 4th floor patient ward volunteer -For the first 6 months, I volunteered in the ER at Orange County's main Level 1 trauma facility.  My duties included preparing beds and trauma rooms for patients, clerical support, transporting patients, and assisting in simple procedures, such as EKGs. -For the remaining 6 months, I transferred to the 4th floor ward.  Here I had significant interaction with patients, including spending time talking with them and their families, bringing them food or phones, and also providing support to the nurses and aides. -The best part of this experience was being able to correlate many procedures and experiences I saw at the ER with those from my job in the pathology lab, giving me two unique perspectives., Intramural and community basketball and soccer leagues -I played on university-sponsored intramural basketball teams each school term in college starting in 2003. -I played in a work-sponsored and community basketball leagues after college.   -Finally, this past year while completing my Masters in Cincinnati, I have been playing in a nearby private soccer league with several classmates. -Sports offers me an enjoyable stress-relieving activity away from work or school, as well as keeps me in physical shape., National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine I was chosen to attend this two-week forum at the Texas Medical Center in Houston with other pre-med students from across the country, where I: -Toured the University of Texas at Houston, including a visit to the cadaver lab and several medical school lectures. -Accompanied a pediatrician on his rounds at Ben Taub General Hospital -Observed a coronary bypass procedure from an observation dome above the OR suite. -Discussed many issues in medicine at the time and met with a young man who was HIV positive.  It was one of the first and most profound experiences that further secured my desire to become a physician., Dean's Honor List I was selected to the Dean's Honor List during Spring quarter of 2002, and again during Winter quarter of 2005., Literature research manuscript for Master's degree -Under the supervision of my thesis adviser Dr. John Lorenz, I am developing a comprehensive literature research paper on The Regulation of Blood Flow to the GI Tract during Fasting and Postprandial States.   -Thus far, I have incorporated over 100 primary research articles and other sources on the regulatory mechanisms for blood flow to the major GI organs, including the stomach, pancreas, small intestine, and colon.  -The manuscript will be complete by the end of this July, at which time I hope to work with my adviser to revise and determine if it is suitable to submit for possible publication. It is also possible that some of the contents of the paper will be incorporated into the Medical Physiology course curriculum here at the College of Medicine., Disneyland Resort Attractions operator -Worked around 25 hours per week during college; 40 hours per week during busy times of the year which often overlapped with school unfortunately. -I worked very unusual hours and days, and due to my school schedule, I often had to work very late night shifts; in some cases even overnight graveyard shifts. -My job duties included: ensuring guest safety and health, negotiating guest concerns, operating complex equipment and computers, and providing creative solutions to many stressful and complicated problems and situations. -Each day, I interacted with thousands of people from all over the world, with a vast range of personalities and emotions that changed minute to minute at time.   -I developed invaluable interpersonal skills that carried over to my other professional and life experiences and, I feel, will offer me a unique advantage in my future medical practice., Eagle Scout , Pathology lab assistant , Shadowed a Pediatric Neurosurgeon"

    "text": "My decision to become a physician developed rather allegorically.  In the cavernous and dank (yet sharply furnished) cave of my consciousness, the light of the Future cast its suggestive shadows.  At first, the indistinct wall shadows resembled pipettes, colonies of bacteria, and a half-satisfied molecular biologist.  A few more shadows soon joined them, however, with images of cameras and hilarious screenplays waiting to be directed.  The messy mob of shadows danced and vied for my approval, but they all fell away as two imposing, but familiar shadows took their place on the cave wall:  the tidy image of my grandfather, and the nimble frame of my elder sister.  Both are medical doctors.  Ever since I realized their sense of fulfillment, and my desire and ability to achieve success in a medical career of my own, I gladly turned toward the light and followed in their shadow.      Allegories aside, for a while during college, my versatile nature steered me away from medicine. I declared a major in the field of Radio/Television/Film.  I do not regret my major to this day, despite its seemingly doubtful worth on a pre-medical resum, because while my pre-med classes made me a better scientist, my film-related activities made me a better person.  Becoming a film student exposed me to leadership opportunities way off the beaten pre-med path:  Imagine the department store IKEA, with its bright blues and yellows, and its grand, maze-like interior of charming furniture displays.  Then imagine it's 3 a.m.  Also, over 50 excited college students running around, a $400,000 HD camera, professional steadicam operators under your hire, lights, mics, a cherry picker, ten scenes to shoot in six hours, including a huge dance sequence in the parking lot, and it's all on your shoulders because you're the Director.  From experiences like these, I know the meaning of stress and pressure beyond those encountered in the classroom.      The most rewarding directing experience of all was becoming a mentor to actors.  I enjoyed building quick relationships of trust and comfort with actors on set, much like doctors must do with their patients in the clinic. While shadowing Dr. Ta, a charismatic D.O. in Neurology, I have realized the importance of maintaining a light-hearted, compassionate rapport with patients and their families, while they cope with Dementia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.  I have learned that a doctor's strength becomes a patient's strength.  As a director, I helped actors abandon their fears, so they could help others laugh and abandon their worries.  However, worries, in my opinion, are not the greatest threat to human happiness; an individual's failing health is.  Therefore, my ultimate goal is to take both the skills I value from my hobby, and my fascination with the mechanics of the physical world, and learn to heal with modern medicine.      When it comes to sharing medical school motivations, it seems as though altruism may flow from applicants like a gooey-sweet tributary into an ocean of professional kindness.  I do not deny my own leakage of this nature, but I would like to attempt to neutralize the waters a bit.  Hence, I offer some purely selfish reasons why I want to go to medical school.  Beginning simply, I like school.  Four more years of student-hood sounds fantastic to me, especially at a school based on the staggering intricacies of the human body. Secondly, once I acquire my medical credentials, maybe I'll be a consultant on a hospital drama like E.R. or House M.D. This cool pastime just might bring my two passions into an amicable co-existence.      Meanwhile, in another part of my imagination, more shadows march across my allegorical cave wall.  They're getting along nicely these days.  Distinct silhouettes of white coats, stethoscopes, and books flicker by.  My own shadow operates on a patient shadow. My sister and Grandfather chat with what looks like Socrates.  I realize that some day, when I turn toward the bright light, it may hurt my eyes at first.  Medical school and beyond will be a great challenge. However, my ultimate wish is to continue on a life path where the destination is as intriguing as the journey there.  Practicing medicine not only fulfills this wish; it also impacts the lives of others on the fundamental level.  For these opportunities, I am confident I will adjust to life outside the cave. Kishwaukee Community Hospital Volunteer At the Cancer Care Center at KCH, I file patient documents, supply information packets, and complete other clerical duties that increase the efficiency of the office.  More importantly, however, I banter with nurses, greet patients, and contribute to the pleasant and welcoming atmosphere that should persist in such a treatment clinic., Research Assistant For some work experience in a patient-centered psychological research lab, I became an aid for Dr. Mineka's Youth Emotion Project in NU's Psychology Department.  There, I witnessed the compassion and clinical aptitude of researchers while I recruited, scheduled, and prepped participants in a study of how their lives are influenced by a wide range of emotional disorders., Shadow/Volunteer Dr. Andrew Ta D.O., Midwest Neurology I shadow Dr. Ta every Monday at his Neurology clinic.  By spending multiple full days with the doctor and his staff, I have gained a clearer understanding of the profession, its challenges, proceedings, and privileges.   I also get distinct work experience, by interviewing patients, taking their blood pressure, reading their file, and discussing their case with Dr. Ta before he sees them himself.  My time working in the doctor's office has been educational, worthwhile, and most importantly, enjoyable., Biology Teaching Assistant Lectured the laboratory portion of Bios 104/5, Biology for Non-majors, and Bios 357 Physiology and Anatomy.  Helped students flesh out their understanding of essential concepts in genetics, anatomy, physiology, and cell biology.  Lectured, supervised laboratories, graded notebooks, wrote exams. Gained experience explaining scientific concepts in clear, concise, stimulating manner., Research in Cellular Biology My interest in the development of bones from cartilage during vertebrate limb development lead me to work on two different experiments in embryology.  In the first experiment, I worked with a technician to research chicken limb adhesion molecules.  During this process, I became very familiar with laboratory bench work. Then, I worked independently to develop a technique to visualize the stages of limb growth in vitro.  With this experience, I developed both an interest in surgical technique and a desire to continue research and publish significant findings in the future., Laboratory Assistant My job description as a laboratory aid included making media, washing dishes, cleaning the benches, and providing sterile pipettes.  I completed these tasks while being efficient, precise, tidy, and timely, contributing to the overall productivity of the lab., Director of Northwestern Student Television Northwestern Student Television (NSTV) is the largest creative endeavor on campus.  As the Director, I lead a group of over forty students to write and film an original sketch comedy show.  It was my duty and pleasure to cast and actors on set, plan shoots, lead an Executive Board, conduct rehearsals, raise funds, organize social events, revise scripts, edit footage, and shoulder the creative responsibility for our unique and hilarious show.  I reached a level of dedication to a group that not everyone is lucky enough to experience.  At the same time, I succeeded in performing a great balancing act, with my student group in one hand, and my student life in the other.      The leadership position I filled showed me the meaning of stress, creativity, and pride in my work.  NSTV was also a great contributor to my current outlook of cool-headed confidence when I encounter an emergency or a challenge.  The entire experience was like a conditioning exercise to face adult life and work with passion., Director, Engineer of Northwestern Radio Drama (NURD) NURD is a student activity unique to Northwestern on the award-winning radio station, WNUR.  I directed this live radio show featuring both original radio plays, and radio plays written by students back in the 1940s, which we revived the school's archives.  I operated the board and sound equipment, and worked with students to create sound effects, unique voiceovers, and shows that were nostalgic and entertaining for both elderly and younger listeners., Volunteering during Alternative Spring BreakS Spring Break 2006: Aided victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans by gutting houses and distributing goods alongside fellow volunteers from all over the country and the victims themselves.  Spring Break 2005:  Volunteered for the World Institute in Virginia.  Restored a mansion and built playhouse for children recuperating from facial surgery.

    "text": "Patience and persistence have been the theme of the last three years of my life. Through my own doing, my poor undergraduate GPA has thwarted my goal of becoming a physician. However, I have continued to battle through my past mistakes in order to have the possibility of becoming the best physician I can be. In order to understand my entire journey to medical school, it has to start with my interest as a child.   When I was growing up, both of my parents always pushed me to follow my interests, and the more I learned, the more passion I had for technology. It began with an old IBM computer and blossomed into shelves of books on programming and hardware that I would avidly read in my free time. I can't begin to count how many times my father had to scold me for taking an expensive electronic device apart and not being able to reassemble it. As I matured, my family, peers, and teachers continued to fuel my interest in technology. I was chosen by the technology coordinator of my school district to work on the school's web page, and I attended the Ohio Supercomputer Center's Summer Institute program. By the time I graduated from high school, it seemed obvious to me, and to everyone else, that I would become an engineer.   During my freshman year in college, I realized that I did not want to become an engineer. I was enrolled in an honors engineering program in which a robotics competition was held in the spring quarter. We worked in groups of four as an engineering team with a defined goal, a budget, and a deadline. At first I enjoyed the challenge, but soon it became very distasteful to me. After it was over, I decided to transfer out of engineering, but I wasn't sure where I wanted to go. I still had a passion for science, but I felt that something important that I needed was missing in the integration of science with engineering.   At that time, two significant things happened almost simultaneously. First, I joined a robotics club in which college students mentored high school students as they designed and built their robots for a competition. Second, I volunteered to work at a hospital. Through the collective experience of both events, I found that the important component that was missing was my desire to combine my love for science with a unique interaction with people. Even as a volunteer, it was apparent to me that being a part of a healthcare team provided a unique interaction with people that is not available in any other field. A physician is a stranger to whom patients entrust their lives. It was through the exploration of this unique relationship that I knew I had found the perfect career for me.   When I did not get accepted to medical school in 2007, I decided to further explore the field of medicine as an EMT-Intermediate. I worked with a private ambulance company whose main focus was taking patients who needed extra attention from primary care facilities to secondary care facilities. Although these patients did not need much medical attention, this work offered me the opportunity to work on communication skills so I could play a more significant role in the patient-physician relationship. My motivation to become a physician crystallized.  However, I did not gain acceptance into medical school in 2008. It became clear that I had to face and correct the mistakes of my undergraduate years, i.e., my low GPA. When I realized I did not want to become an engineer, I grew somewhat apathetic about my grades. As a result, my GPA plummeted far below the acceptable standards for admission to medical school. Although I knew I was highly motivated for a career in the field of medicine, it was up to me to prove somehow that my earlier performance was not a true reflection of my abilities. My opportunity came through the Master's degree program in Physiology at the University of Cincinnati. In this program, I took courses in physiology, micro-anatomy, and biochemistry with the first-year medical students. This experience allowed me to demonstrate my dedication to the field of medicine and my ability to succeed in medical school. In the medical school courses, I ranked in the top 20 among all of the medical students, and I was at the top of my class in the Master's program. This program restored my faith in my abilities as a conscientious student and gave me confidence that I will be a great physician someday.  With patience, persistence, and hard work over the last three years, I have become a better, more confident student, and I am more motivated than ever to become a physician. The mistakes of my past may continue to follow me, but I have proven that I can be a top student in medical coursework. I look forward to beginning my study in medical school, and I know I will have a successful and personally fulfilling future in the field of medicine. OSU Medical Center Volunteer After my Freshman year as an engineer, I decided to explorer the world of medicine. I found the best way to do that was through volunteer experiences at the OSU Medical Center. I spent time in the Atrium, where families would wait for their loved ones as they underwent surgery; in the SICU where patients who were in critical condition were constantly monitored; in the MICU where patients who had been in the hospital for a lengthy amount of time for a terminal condition are monitored constantly; in the ER where I could see anything from a common cold to level 1 traumas; and on floors helping nurses. The experience gave me a closer view into the medical world and shaped my beliefs on how the medical field is professionally., FIRST For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Tech. I was in First since December of 2003. First is a robotics program where Engineering mentors help/teach high school students how to build robots bigger than a human. These robots are design to compete in a international obstacle course. In the 2005 season, I was the leader of the of the team that mentored kids at the Columbus School For Girls. The experience taught me how to manage a series of complex task efficiently and timely. Also, I learned patients and understanding as I taught difficult concepts to students., ED Undergraduate Research Assistant In the Emergency Room, physicians would have research projects that they would work on. Because physicians are busy with patients, they do not have time to monitor all the patients coming into the ER to catch which ones would be good for their studies. It would be my job to look through the patients and pin point which patients could participate in the studies. Once I found a patient that was eligible, I would begin some of the rudimentary aspects of the study, leaving the difficult parts for the physician to complete. This experience has given me a larger insight into the professional world of medicine. I not only got to watch the physicians work, but I got to learn more about the procedures that go on in a hospital., LifeCare EMT LifeCare is a private ambulance company that specializes in taking discharged patients from hospitals and placing them in extended care facilities. Through my experience with LifeCare I have practice many of my Intermediate skills including suctioning, bagging, and starting IV's. The majority of my experience has taught me good patient communication and assessment skills. In addition to these skills, LifeCare has immersed me into the medical field allowing for a detailed and first hand view into the profession., OSU Automobile Parts Department When mechanics needed parts, it was my job to research what part they needed and find the supplier for the part. This job taught me how to do research quickly. There was not much time to find one part before another needed to be found. It also taught me how to multi task many large problems at once. While I was on the phone with one supplier I was looking up a part for another project. There were periods of the job where many parts needed to be ordered at once, causes a large amount of stress. Through conquering this stress, it may help when dealing with stressful situations in the medical field."

    "text": "Hey Young, KT asks me in his thick Korean accent, what is the 'catch a ride' means I give it some thought, then reply in a chimeric mix of Korean and English. He understands perfectly, and exclaims, Oh I see! I cannot wait to learning English like you!  For over a year now, my weekends have been a blur of broken English and wide-eyed optimism. Having been raised bilingual, I've had the privilege of volunteering English lessons to a foreign student named KT. Our long-distance conversation hours span various topics, such as pop culture and religion, and serve to improve his grasp on the language.  KT's inquiring mind is incredible. With questions that range from simple verb tenses to obscure sitcom humor, he draws the greatest interest from the smallest cultural details. It is a humbling and inspiring experience, and we often lose track of time. Our bi-weekly sessions conclude with advice on how to further refine his conversational skills. Since KT's job as an international businessman demands English proficiency, these English lessons are vital to his professional livelihood.  My weekly meetings with KT may not be medically related, but strangely enough, they represent my longing to serve as a physician. In fact, each of my numerous experiences with tutoring, ranging from part-time jobs to countless voluntary undertakings, have all fostered this desire. What fascinates me most about teaching is also what attracts me to the practice of medicine: the perpetual opportunity to help people on a personal level. Helping others to grow in their own right, in turn, endows me with an indescribable sense of fulfillment.  Attributing my future ambitions solely to the metaphysical rewards of philanthropy, however, would be incomplete. There is a more tangible side to my motivation - a thirst for learning about the medical sciences.  My dedication to learning rivals the joy I find in teaching and volunteering. For me, nothing can replace the absorbing subject matter, the constant mental challenge, the classroom camaraderie, and the thought of engaging in a noble profession. Through the Human Biology program at Michigan State, I've taken many classes similar to a basic medical curriculum at an undergraduate level. Courses with direct clinical relevance, such as biochemistry and physiology, have most fascinated me and are a constant reminder that medicine is the profession for me. The way this seemingly esoteric field of knowledge manifests in daily life has been both intimidating and exciting.  On a clinical level, volunteering at the University of Michigan Hospital has only reaffirmed these medical aspirations. I've been blessed to be able to observe firsthand, the unique profession of medicine. Months of witnessing the various aspects of the doctor-patient exchange have given me much insight into the medical world. Granted these experiences were merely cursory in light of the expansive hospital subculture, but I've realized that the profession embodies everything I seek in a career:  opportunities for compassion, creativity, hard and meaningful work, and the potential to make a significant difference in people's lives. I have also shadowed a dermatologist and orthopedic surgeon on a regular basis, learning much in the process, and plan to continue shadowing and volunteering in the upcoming year.  I admit that, in retrospect, my pursuit of medicine does not relate back to a single, life-changing event. My pursuit has been a lifelong journey, encompassing much thought and a myriad of experiences. From my weekends with KT, to volunteering in the hospital, to even engaging in fascinating clinical courses, my life experiences have helped me discover and grow a deep passion to pursue a medical career. I know I still have much to learn, but I look forward to engaging in lifelong learning and the unparalleled privilege of serving others - they are why I pursue medicine.

    "text": "My majors are Ministerial Theology and Biochemistry, with a minor in Biblical Languages.  Studying both subjects has not been detrimental to one or the other, but they have complimented each other.  Learning extensively in each has broadened my ways of thinking in both.  I have flourished in and thoroughly enjoyed both of these courses of study and have discovered that they may not be as contradictory as many would suppose. For me, spiritual life is vital.  It informs my major decisions and influences my daily life.  Though not every whim will be spiritually based, the principles of Christianity, such as love and respect to all people, kindness, compassion, integrity, and contentment, do have applications in my relationships, recreation, education, and career goals.  As an outflow of these principles and through personal conviction, I chose the first of my majors. I am not blind, however, to the talents that I believe I have been entrusted with.  Ability and propensity toward the medical sciences course throughout my family tree.  There are skilled physicians, physical and occupational therapists, and nurses.  Additionally, my scholastic record and personal enjoyment of the topic have caused me to select a major in the sciences. Thus being a pupil in these two disciplines acknowledges both my individual and familial identities.  Learning both develops heart and hand.  They allow me to be attentive to the inside and outside of people.  It blends faith and works, so to speak.   This alloy is beneficial to me in very mundane ways as well.  My curiosity and thirst for knowledge are practically insatiable, and my interests are very widespread; however, this can cause me to have a short attention span at times.  Studying both subjects allows me to capitalize on my time even when I am distracted.   Studying both has also expanded my thought processes.  From theology, I have developed critical thinking, self-reflection, interpersonal skills, and resource development.  I have practiced understanding and respecting other cultures and points of view, as well as have engaged in discussion about ethical issues.  My abstract thinking has been stretched. From biochemistry, I have learned logical thought, clear documentation, teamwork, and problem-solving.  Diligence, following directions, thinking outside the box, and appreciation for forerunners were also picked up.  My concrete thinking was developed. In addition, there were some lessons that I learned from both disciplines.  These include the abilities to apply concepts to specific situations and to use specific conditions to generate conclusions.  Moreover, I have seen that passion and persistence are necessary to pursue distant goals. I am able to use all of these lessons in both areas of study.  For example, the abstract thinking helps me understand courses which are highly conceptual, such as organic chemistry and physics, while the concrete thinking facilitates my grasp of church history and prods me to apply practical applications to doctrinal teachings.  The ethics training has obvious applications to medicinal science, while the logical thought buffers reckless theological positions.  I am benefited in each by studying both. Furthermore, theology gives me motivation for studying the biochemistry.  The knowledge gained from the study of the sciences can be used to be a blessing and to bring hope to hurting people.  This is a spiritual experience.  In addition, I see the physical world as a creative marvel that is meant to be intriguing and interesting.  It is exciting to learn of it in closer detail. Conversely, biochemistry can supply energy to the study of theology.  Witnessing the complexity of the natural world increases my appreciation for the Designer.  In addition, facing the fact that someone's life may end soon because of some biological or chemical factor increases the gravity of life, and causes one to consider the more serious issues of life and death. Ministerial theology and biochemistry have not been enemies for me, but friends.  They have not fought, but embraced--and even more.  Each has promoted the well-being of the other.  They have been two sides of one coin, which I have been privileged to hold.  They have been two sides of Velcro binding together the divine and the natural.  I am blessed and nourished by this combination.

    "text": "It is not a coincidence that the most important periods in my life that have guided me towards pursuing a career in medicine have also molded me into a more compassionate and confident person. As the youngest of three, it was difficult growing up in a family where neither of my parents nor siblings graduated from college, let alone applied to any graduate programs. Striving for excellence became an internal pursuit, for my family did not push me to achieve more.  My personal experiences through the years have allowed me to overcome the lack of support from my family.  I decided that I wanted to pursue medicine while I was in high school and made it my personal goal ever since. I went on a trip to my parents' hometown in Greece when I was seventeen that further reinforced my future ambition. I was only a toddler the last time I had visited, and this would, in essence, be my first opportunity to acquaint myself with my extended family. In addition to meeting an extraordinary family, I was amazed by the tiny, rural village I was visiting. The town did not have running water until the 1990s! I spent a day with my uncle, a shepherd, to see what life was like for him. His eyes looked tired and his hands were worn by the years of working in the fields. I suspected that he never took a much needed day off. He looked at me and assured me that even on the toughest days the ability to provide for the village with his flock is what drives him and a day off wasn't an option. His strength and commitment to his occupation and supporting his family molded my vision of hard work and made me even more determined to succeed in my future goal to become a doctor. Although his way of life is atypical in the US, the values that drive them are not. As I discovered, responsibility arises in the form of the talents and skills that one possesses. With that in mind, I feel that it is necessary for me to parlay a valuable education from UCLA and UC along with a passion for science and medicine in a manner that serves my community.   To prepare for medical school, I sought healthcare experiences. My first step in exploring medicine firsthand came during my third year in college as a Care Extender at Santa Monica's UCLA hospital. I treated every task as an opportunity to learn and that allowed me to interact with the doctors, nurses, and staff. I sought rotations that placed me in high intensity departments where I was engaged by an array of procedures and exposed to trauma cases. My lessons learned in Greece resurfaced on a most memorable day. One morning, I received a call in the cardiac catheterization lab informing us of an incoming patient who had recently stabilized from cardiac arrest. As we prepared, the cardiologist pulled me aside and sternly asked me if I was ready to call in a subsequent code, charge the defibrillator, and begin chest compressions should our patient crash again. I thought to myself, Would he really trust a volunteer during such a critical time His belief in my training and ability to implement my skills without hesitation is what was crucial; I fully accepted and was ready for the challenge. As my uncle taught me years earlier, if I am skilled and capable, I am inherently responsible to act. As an aspiring doctor, instances like this energize me.  As a future practicing doctor, I intend to be the focal point for the convergence of actions and ideas that will make a positive impact in my community.  It is very important for me to empower those around me to utilize their skills in ways to maximize one's potential in the same way I was empowered as a volunteer by the cardiologist on that memorable morning.  After completion of a challenging two year contract as a lecturer of physiology at the University of California, Irvine, I felt that my leadership and organizational skills as well as my new found aptitude for public speaking complimented my long term goals. After recently applying to medical school without success and with these experiences behind me, my next logical step was to apply to a masters program in order to improve my application and over all dismal 3.27 GPA from UCLA.  I knew that attending a program would remove me from the comforts of California, a struggling family business, and my family.  This was a sacrifice that I had to make, one that will benefit me in the long term.  After receiving acceptances from UC, Georgetown, Tulane, UMDNJ, and Loyola of Chicago, I chose UC's M.S. in Physiology.  Learning from a physiology department that ranks 6th in the nation, taking medical courses with the current medical students, and writing a thesis on the emerging field of neurogenesis, was the trial by fire I needed in order to know that I can succeed in the medical field.  I now know that I can manage the workload and pressures of a medical school/graduate school setting as shown by my overall 3.65 GPA at UC.  More importantly, I used this opportunity to remedy the bad study habits that have plagued me as an undergrad.  In conclusion, I'm extremely proud of my personal growth. Although I haven't taken a direct path into medical school, I feel that my experiences have given me a unique motivation and responsibility to become a humble advocate in healthcare. Lecturer, UC Irvine As a lecturer in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UCI, I had the special opportunity of working autonomously for Biological Sciences 112L and as part of a team for Biological Sciences 100LW.  My duties for both classes included preparing a and delivering lectures, running the labs, and preparing and grading all post labs, lab reports and exams.  In addition, all of the instructors in 100LW would conduct writing workshops to help aid students in improving their writing skills with regard to scientific writing.  As my first job out of college, working as a lecturer was ideal because it required me to use all of the knowledge and skills from my undergraduate in order to successfully teach., Duke's Charbroiler At Duke's, I managed the morning shifts and prepared the payroll, inventory, and dealt with the vendors., Greek Folk Dancing Every year, St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Bakersfield, California holds a Greek food festival for the community.  A major attraction for the festival is the Greek folk dancing.  I had the opportunity to lead the young adult dance group from high school up until I graduated college.  Our style over the years varied ranging from such dances as the Tsamikos from Epirus and Roumeli to the Cretan Syrtos, where improvisation made for a great show.  Our group would showcase its skills throughout the community for private shows to raise money for the church as well as for our annual festival., Provost Honors List I made the Provost Honors List during a quarter in which two phsyiology classes and a biochemisty lab/lecture was taken., Golden Ox I managed the day shift at the Golden Ox.  The Golden Ox is a diner that my father owns in Bakersfield, California.  I managed the restaurant during a time when my father was unable to do so.  My duties included payroll, inventory, hiring/firing, and general upkeep of the facility., Private Tutor I privately tutored high school students (and one undergrad) in subjects that included physics, chemistry, and biology.  I maintained close communication with parents and am pleased to say that improvement was noted in most cases., Ranch Hand I recently took a trip to Greece to visit my family and ended up staying longer than intended to work on grandfather's ranch for a few months in order to better understand the lifestyle of my family in Greece and to become more acquainted with my relatives.  My primary duties on the ranch were split between caring to the livestock and working in the tobacco fields.  Depending on the day, I would feed, milk, and graze my grandfather's sheep or pick and sew tobacco leaves together for further processing., Neuro-Rehab West Neuro-Rehab West was my first hands on experience in the clinical research field, specifically in the rehabilitation and study of patients with trauma to their spinal cords.  The purpose of the study was two fold:  to provide physical therapy to subjects via stretching and weight bearing support and to also study the effects of this therapy on EMG activity in the legs.  My role was to stretch the patients as well as to maintain proper leg movement on a treadmill as each subject was placed onto a weight bearing  harness., Recreational Indoor Soccer Our soccer team met once a week to compete in organized competitive matches in a co-ed league.  I found this experience to be a great opportunity to take a small break away from the rigors of my schoolwork in Cincinnati.  I had an exhilarating time playing goalkeeper for the first time in my life.  The learning curve for that position is definitely a painful one, but the friendships and camaraderie were extremely rewarding., Systems Biology & Physiology Program Retreat Retreat Description:  The second annual retreat of the Systems Biology & Physiology Program was held on Friday, May 23, 2008 at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The retreat showcased the research of students and faculty in the SBP program, and highlighted systems approaches to research bridging modern physiology and clinical medicine.  Keynote Address: Roger Brent, PhD Other Lecturers: Arnold Strauss, MD Jay R Hove, PhD Jaroslav Meller, PhD Timothy A Pritts, MD, Care Extenders Intern The Care Extender program allowed me to view the dynamic inner workings of a hospital from several different perspectives.  My first and fifth rotation, Med-Surge, allowed me to get my feet wet with regard to a hospital setting.  My duties included patient transport, pick up and delivery (pharmacy and lab), clerical work, and patient interaction.  My second and third rotation, in the cardiac cath lab, provided me with the opportunity to assist in and observe minor heart procedures such as catheterizations, angiograms, angioplasties, as well as emergency procedures, such as codes.  My fourth rotation, in the emergency room, provided the most complete exposure.  My duties in the ER included those of Med-Surge, as well as running EKGs, and observing the spontaneity of a department that serves a diverse population.  My overall experience from this program was priceless., Evergreen Healthcare Center This nursing home was my first exposure to the healthcare field.  As a student volunteer, I had the opportunity to interact with the staff.  Through my questions and their insight, I was able to learn a great deal about the ailments that afflict our elderly today: such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.  I also had the opportunity to interact with the patients.  I was privileged to spend time with patients that had few visitors.  We played board games, took walks, enjoyed lunches together, and spent time talking.  Being able to interact with a group of individuals with such history and insight meant a great deal to me, especially at such a young age., Student Research Project Through a student research project at UCLA funded by Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, I was able to join Dr. Keith Tansey in his research on treadmill training in spinal contused rats.  The research consisted of two sets of contused rats: a trained group and a untrained controls.  After the training phase, immunohistochemical assays were performed to observe any significant neurophysiological differences between the two groups.  My role in this project dealt with the training phase and animal care.  The training phase consisted of running each rat on a miniature treadmill while supported by a boom that adjusted the rat's level of weight bearing.  Between training days, progress was observed subjectively by noting the range of motion of each joint and by objectively recording the motion of each leg through the use of robotic arms attached to each hind leg.  Overall, this experience allowed me to understand, first hand, the dedication and work needed to successfully contribute to a scientific research project., Traveling When time permits, I enjoy traveling to new loctations to experience the people and culture.  So far, I have travelled across the United States and have visited  14 different States.  In addition, I have taken 3 different trips to Europe and have visited 9 different  countries."

    "text": "Just as I have come to truly appreciate my parents, they were both diagnosed with lung cancer -- 6 months apart.  While I haven't calculated the probability of 2 unrelated, married, non-smoker adults having the exact same mutation in the same exon of the same gene, I'm certain it's minuscule. The first instances my parents were diagnosed, I was, ironically enough, doing cancer research in New York. Thanks to modern technology, I immediately accessed the latest research which I voraciously digested. As I got bogged down in the depressing statistics, I eventually grasped what my dad has repeated all along: while he and my mom live, they have 100% survival rates.  My parents' dedication to serving patients and helping others renews my inspiration to be a doctor every day. My dad regularly calls his partners to check on patients he feels he abandoned mid-treatment, and despite his double vision he slowly pages through medical journals daily to feed his constant desire to master more knowledge. My mom, a patient herself, has become more than a caregiver for my dad. She diagnoses his skin infections, and determines whether it's time to administer certain antibiotics, to lance a pustule (which she does herself), or to rush to the ER. My dad has actually avoided minor surgery thanks to her quick-thinking and discerning mind.  Unfortunately I wasn't always so cognizant or appreciative of my parents' keen abilities to help others. In college, I eschewed their advice as I loaded my schedule with coaching soccer, singing, and karate on top of taking the maximum course loads. When my focus and grades suffered, from a combination of overexertion both physically and mentally, racism from my roommate, and the deaths of both of my grandfathers within a month of each other, I finally sought my parents' wisdom during a summer at home. As I searched for direction in my life, I also reacquainted myself with who my parents were, aside from being my parents.  The first thing I noticed that summer was how appreciative strangers were of my dad. The strangers invariably turned out to be his patients, and I was struck by a newfound appreciation for how profoundly he had affected their lives. I'd always thought of medicine as a hard, objective science used to cure patients methodically. Shadowing my dad and several of his colleagues allowed me to observe the compassionate care these doctors provided to people in their most vulnerable state, and I became more intrigued. I watched them use medicine as a vehicle to share knowledge and solve patients' problems, and realized that this mix of science and empathy was my passion. I devoted the next handful of years of my life towards understanding people and their behavior by majoring in psychology, and continued to tackle the physiology of the human body in my graduate studies. My masters program served a dual purpose of also exposing me to non-Western modalities of medicine, on which American patients increasingly rely, to increase the breadth of my knowledge of all possible treatment options. I was especially curious about the body and the mechanisms behind cancer -- a disease which can plague every organ, so I accepted a position researching antibodies for use in cancer vaccines.  As enriching and rewarding my academic studies and ensuing research have been, the perspectives I have gained from my personal experiences are far more salient.  My parents have been treated by an array of physicians, and each one has unconditionally helped us through setbacks, while improving my parents' quality of life on an immediate and personal level. Experiencing healthcare from the other side - not as a patient but as a caregiver - has further fueled my passion to be a doctor. I've seen firsthand that medicine is sometimes more of an art than a science -- particularly as my dad's survival far surpasses his prognosis.  Although leaving my research position for P&G seems a far cry from my goal of serving patients, it was only a quick and temporary detour when my dad was diagnosed with a second, very rare metastasis. At P&G I found the best possible job to leverage my science and psychology background, and now I believe I can reapply what I'm learning to practicing medicine because so much of my job involves understanding consumers, translating our innovative technologies to them, and finding solutions to bridge that communication gap. It is a different type of problem-solving and requires a different vocabulary, but I am continuously honing my communication and leadership skills. I also hope to translate what I've learned from my parents and their physicians into becoming a better person and a better doctor. In the meantime, I appreciate that every day is a miracle I have to spend with my parents. Publication for 2008 USCAP Chen, Y., Schwartz, M., Kitabayashi, N., Hsu, M., Scherr, D.S., and Y-T Chen.

    "text": "I never had the proverbial light-bulb moment that explains why I want to be a doctor.  Instead, the dream of being a doctor has germinated within me since my youngest years.  After mission trips and other service experiences, education abroad, thought-provoking conversations, and exposure to medicine in a variety of settings, the seed planted in my youth has flowered into a strong passion.  It was a mission trip to Juarez, Mexico, the summer before my freshman year in high school, that strengthened my calling to serve others.  Members from my parish and I spent ten days in Mexico constructing a house for a family we had never met.  Not only was this the first experience outside of the US, but also the first time for me to witness extreme and unfamiliar poverty.  Needless to say, I was outside of my comfort zone.  Yet, after a few days working with the family and the surrounding community, these differences quickly dissipated.  Getting to know and provide a new home for this family, who in return treated us as one of their own, gave me personal satisfaction and hope in humanity.  Ever since then, I have believed in the responsibility of helping ones 'neighbors'.  Also, as someone who was even then aspiring towards the medical field, I saw the importance of being able to listen to and work with people spanning many cultural backgrounds.  My recent study-abroad experience in Toledo, Spain reinforced the importance of experiencing cultural diversity as preparation for a medical career.  While in Spain, communication barriers sometimes made it difficult to get across what I wanted to say.  Yet despite my limited vocabulary, I was impressed by the respect and enthusiasm of those I met who were genuinely eager to learn from foreigners like me.  From this experience, I see the necessity of addressing every person with patience and an open-mind.  This ability to relate to people on their own terms, one of my personal strengths, will enable me to be an understanding and considerate physician, someone who is not distracted by superficial differences in race, culture, or language which could otherwise affect a physician's ability to treat all of his/her patients with the same quality of care.  Not only does the medical field fulfill my passion to serve and work with all types of people, but it has interested me since late childhood.  As a young girl, it was common for me to hear my father, a neurologist, talk about patients and work concerns at the dinner table.  Due to my intrinsically curious nature, I often initiated questions related to my dad's work, eager to wrap my mind around how and why people get sick and potential ways they can be helped.  These early dinner conversations were coupled with weekly walks around the block, those special times for asking my dad even bigger questions concerning life, the world, and why everything works the way it does.  To my surprise, my dad often indicated that he didn't know the answer to questions I posed.  What I learned is that some of life's questions do not have clear-cut definitive answers, or might even have more than one acceptable explanation.  To me, the challenging and complex nature of the problems we discussed made them all that more important and exciting to address.  Given my aptitude for grappling with and understanding difficult concepts tied with a desire to serve others, I felt strongly about pursuing a career in medicine.  With my career goal in my mind, I was determined to gain actual experience in the medical setting.  I volunteered in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and Medical Intensive Care Unit at the Ohio State Medical Center during my freshman year at the Ohio State University, assisting and interacting with patient's families during visitation hours while observing the variety of personalities of the hospital staff, the reactions of patients and their families after tragic situations, and the frenetic or stressful activity of most days.  After shadowing several physicians in community pediatrics and academic neurology, I better understand and relish the great diversity of career choices even within medicine.  Also, in the past two years, I have worked in the Financial Assistance Department for the OSU Medical Center.  Here I realized the extent of work involved in running a fully functioning hospital and the large amount of data and information processing that takes place behind the scenes.  My experience showed me the great complexity of the health care system as a whole, as well as the opportunities for improvement.  Ensuring that all Americans have access to basic health care and improving the overall health of our country, while managing our costs, is one of the great challenges of our generation - but one which must be addressed.  I now enter my final year of undergraduate study eager to take the next step towards becoming a doctor.  My personal strengths - compassion for serving others, excellent communication skills, talent/enthusiasm for grasping complex, challenging subjects, and a capacity for hard and sustained work - make me well-suited for the role of a physician.  I welcome the challenge of medical school and residency training to realize my goal of becoming an outstanding doctor for my future patients. Nanny During the summers of 2007 and 2008 I watched over the Monaghan children three days a week.  I was in charge of ensuring the three children accomplished household chores and homework as well as transporting them to and from clubs and team practices.  I would also entertain the kids by taking them to the pool, the parks, teaching them tennis, or playing games with them.  I already had a great deal of experience with babysitting and looking after children before this but nothing on as regular of a basis.  Overall, this was truly a rewarding experience as I have always loved working with kids., Financial Assistance Department- Student Intern I have been a student intern in the financial assistance department of the Ohio State Medical center (OSUMC) since the beginning of my sophomore year in September of 2008, working an average of 10 hours per week while taking classes and then working full time during the summer.  This year, I worked at an additional site in the Financial Counseling Department of the OSUMC as well.  My responsibilities within the first department include analyzing and uploading all of the Hospital Care Assurance Program (HCAP) applications, correcting ICD-9 codes on Bureau of Workers Compensation claims, and communicating with a team of nurses, analysts, and managers to accomplish various other projects.  Since I work with confidential hospital and patient information, I am always cautious to ensure no leaking of sensitive information.  My responsibilities within the Financial Counseling Department include filling out and faxing forms for the newborn babies at OSUMC, calling patients related to their upcoming visits and obtaining up to date insurance information or if they are uninsured, sending out the necessary forms to apply for the HCAP.  Also, I shadow the financial counselors on their rounds in the hospital as they educate patients in person about the HCAP and what they need to apply., Treasurer I have been involved in the Pre-Medicine club since its early beginnings during my first year at Ohio State University and was just voted this spring to be the next treasurer.  I helped to create the constitution for the Pre-Medicine club when it was forming as well as to select the very first officers.  The past three years I have participated in various functions and meetings held by the club.  For example, I joined the pre-med club's Relay for Life Team in 2008 and got another friend outside of the club to participate and raise money for the American Cancer Society.  This spring, I knew I wanted to take an even more active role in this club since I feel I have lot of experience as a pre-medical student at OSU and I have great plans for increasing club membership and for future events.  As treasurer, I will be in charge of membership dues as well as managing the club's bank account and payments for events.  I have already attended three executive board meetings for the club where we have discussed plans for next year.  Also, this summer I will be attending a training workshop to further prepare for my position as treasurer., Dean's List I have made the Dean's List at Ohio State University for a total of 7 consecutive quarters.  This recognition is for those students who earn a 3.5 or above as a full time student., Race for the Cure I participated in Race for the Cure this year with two other individuals from my Pre-Medicine club through Ohio State University.  I raised $150 dollars for this event and plan on participating again in future years., Ohio Academic Scholarship I received the Ohio Academic Scholarship as a result of my high academic achievements in high school as well as being a National Merit Commended Student.  The reward amount is $2,000 per year for my four years of undergraduate studies., Undergraduate Research Assistant I started working in the Stress and Immunity Breast Cancer Projects lab at the beginning of fall quarter of 2009.  This lab conducts cancer research focusing on those living with cancer and quality of life issues such as sexuality, spirituality, post traumatic stress, mind body effects, depression and cancer recurrence.  In the lab, I am one of the primary medical trackers.  This job involves following up on medical information for the subjects in the ongoing studies in terms of their medical diagnoses, current treatment, progress, and recurrences.  In order to fill out the necessary assessment information for the breast cancer studies, I have to know how to read the physician's medical charts in terms of the various medical tests, cancer staging, treatments, and terminology used.  Along with my med-tracking duties, I also follow up on subjects who have dropped from the various studies over the years in an excel file which I created with this information.   Additionally, within three months of working in the lab I was responsible for training other undergraduate assistants in their lab responsibilities and I also helped to write a training guide for anyone who would be taking over my responsibilities with medical tracking in the future., Hospital Student Volunteer I volunteered in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and then the Surgical Intensive Unit on a weekly basis throughout my freshman year at the Ohio State University.  My responsibilities included facilitating visitation hours with the nurses for the patient's families and maintaining a current chart record of the patient's rooms and the corresponding nurses in charge.  This clinical experience demonstrated to me firsthand the amount of collaboration needed to work in a hospital setting.  The doctors, nurses, hospital staff, and volunteers, like myself, all worked as a team to ensure the best quality of care to the patients and assistance to their families.  Having a role in this hospital community and the chance to help the patients and families truly reinforced my decision to become a doctor.  I was awarded the OSU Medical Center Outstanding Commitment to Service Volunteer in 2008 for my year of volunteer service., Flag Football Intramural I was a member of a coed intramural flag football team through the Ohio State Department of Recreational Sports for the fall quarter of 2009., Maximus Scholarship I was awarded the Maximus Scholarship for my four years at Ohio State University for my excellent SAT and ACT scores and for being in the top three percent of my high school class.   As part of this scholarship, I was also invited to compete in the Maximus competition which is held in February for Maximus Scholars to compete for 10 Presidential Scholarships covering full tuition.  Although, I did not win a full scholarship, I volunteered for subsequent Maximus competitions by giving tours to Maximus Scholars and their families and being available to discuss my experiences with Ohio State University and answer any questions., Golden Key National Honor Society I was invited to join this honorary society near the beginning of my sophomore year at Ohio State University.  Since then, I have participated in many of the group activities such as canned food drives and workshops on graduate endeavors and professionalism., Customer Experience Associate I worked at Old Navy as a customer experience associate during the summer of 2008.  My responsibilities included greeting and engaging customers, maintaining a neat, clean, and organized working and shopping environment, managing the fitting rooms, organizing the clothing racks, and promoting  and educating customers about the various sales and offers from the Old Navy Card.  As a whole, my number one priority was to offer the customer friendly, available and quick service in all aspects of their shopping experience., Buck-I-Serv: Alternate Spring Break In the spring of 2009, I applied to participate in a service trip to Slidell, LA to build houses with Habitat for Humanity over spring break.   During this week long service program, ten other Ohio State students and I joined construction leaders from Habitat for Humanity to work on some houses in one of the neighborhoods that had been affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  My group worked about 8 hours every day for a week constructing stairs and front porches, insulating the houses, and cleaning the insides.  I learned how to operate various power tools such as the crosscut saw for cutting the wood planks and power drills to put together the flooring and railings., Leadership Ohio State Leadership Ohio State (LOS) is an organization in which first year Honors and Scholars students can apply in order to benefit from leadership and networking experiences at Ohio State University.  As a member of LOS, I participated in leadership workshop events and various other meetings related to team building and working with fellow members on campus.  At the leadership workshop in particular, we learned the skills necessary to become great leaders such as effective communication, enhanced listening skills, leading with integrity, building trust and solid relationships among group members, effectively delegating tasks to others, problem solving and decision-making skills.,  Nanny, Relay for Life Relay for Life is a 24 hour event sponsored by the American Cancer Society, a national voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer, saving lives, and diminishing suffering from cancer, through research, education, advocacy, and service.  After hearing the positive response from peers who had previously participated in Relay for Life my freshman year in high school, I decided I would get a team together for the following year.  Throughout my life I have seen various family members and friends battle with cancer so this cause is very important to me.  In 2005, my sophomore year in high school, I motivated ten of my friends to join the Relay for Life team that I created.  I set our fundraising goal at $1,000, an amount which we eventually exceeded by a few hundred.  We also held a bake sale which took place during the actual Relay for Life event to raise more money.  The next year many of my previous team members joined me and another co-captain because of their great experience with this event.  In total, I have led and/or participated and fundraised for Relay for Life over five consecutive years.  I have also managed to raise hundreds of dollars each year on my own.,  Student intern in Financial Counseling Department"

    "text": "I grew up thinking I was going to be an accountant like my dad.  The only thing I have in common with that thought now is the number two, the number of years I have now been rejected from medical school.  I did not make the decision to become a doctor early in my life, nor was this decision one that I made lightly.  The realization that I wanted to be a doctor came to me in high school, when I started to apply to colleges.  It dawned on me that it was important to pick my school based on what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, and for the first time, I began seriously considering what would allow me to be the person that I wanted to be.  At the time, I made a list of my strengths and of the things that were important to me.  I knew that I was smart enough and dedicated enough that if I found something I truly wanted, I would be able to accomplish it, leaving me only to find what would bring that dedication. My strengths were initially difficult to put into words, but what I eventually came up with satisfied me.  I would describe the first strength I saw in myself as my ability to empathize with those around me, and my desire to help people, often based on that empathy.  I also knew that I had a strong aptitude for the sciences, and a thirst for understanding, especially in Biology.  I distinctly remember thinking about this strength, and wondering what a person could do as a job related to strength in biology.  The final strength I thought about was the fact that I enjoyed constant learning.  We always had Smithsonian and National Geographic in my house, and I read both of them constantly, as they were my main sources of new information. It was not until all of these ideas had coalesced and had time to integrate that it occurred to me that I might want to be a doctor.  After a good deal of reflection, I became certain.  I was excited to learn, especially about health, and I knew that the field of medicine was constantly updating, and that to be an excellent doctor, you have to keep up with these changes through constant continuing education.  I was certain that this was what I had been looking for, and chose my school accordingly. Now I knew what I wanted to do, and came to college and chose to major in philosophy, a choice that may at first seem strange.  My reason however, was quite simple.  My uncle was just finishing medical school at the time, and he told me that he wished he had majored in something outside of the field of science, so that he would not have focused all of his education so heavily on one topic.  Based on this advice, I realized that I would learn all of the essential science that I needed to from my pre-medical courses, and through classes once I was in medical school.  For this reason, I looked for a field outside of science which brought out my intellectual curiosity.  Looking back now, I am extremely glad I took these classes.  Not only were they interesting and challenging, but they also gave me an ability to analyze in a way that was different from my normal thought process.  I feel that this training will make me a more complete doctor and person. My final year as an undergraduate I found a program that would keep me connected with my goal of going to medical school while at the same time finishing my major in philosophy.  I entered a combined degree program, and was able to get an MA in Bioethics while finishing my fourth year.  This program had many admirable components, and only further encouraged my desire to be a doctor.  The most important aspect of this program for me, however, was the clinical rotations.  This was my first real view of what it meant to be a doctor every day in a hospital setting, and I saw a lot that I expected, and learned a lot that I had not.  In all cases though, these rotations instilled in me an even greater sense of excitement than I had already felt. This is my third year applying to medical school, and I spent my year since graduation finding ways to enrich myself, and finding ways to better prepare myself for my medical school experience.  Volunteering at Habitat for Humanity showed me yet again how much I enjoy giving of myself to others, and being able to work with the future homeowners was like a preview of what I will enjoy once I am a doctor.  Tutoring high school biology kept me excited about what I will be learning once I am in medical school, and throughout my career.  My EMT course has kept me connected to the health care field, and has again assured me that I am heading in the right direction.  Finally, my research has opened my eyes to the academic side of medicine, a side which I now find to have great appeal.  It has also showed me that I have quite an unexpected aptitude in this setting of academic medicine.     While it has been disappointing not to be able to begin medical school as soon as I had wanted to, thus pushing back my ultimate goal of becoming a doctor, it has not made me waver in my desire.  This is something that I have been sure about for quite a while now, and it was not an unexamined decision.  I know that this path will lead me to a career in which I will be aided by my strengths, and I will find deep satisfaction in my work. Bioethics clinical Rotations As a part of my MA in Bioethics, I spent 80 hours in clinical rotations each semester.  My first semester was spent at The Cleveland Clinic, and my second semester was at Metro Hospital. These rotations were an incredible opportunity to experience a hospital setting as a close observer.  I was able to take part in rounds in almost every possible field by the time that I was done with my rotations.  This allowed me to formulate some idea of what I might want to specialize in.  It also gave me an opportunity to recognize the many varied disciplines, and some of what it means to be a part of each one of them. Many of the rounds I went to left a deep impression on me and helped me to yet again realize how much I really want to be a doctor.  Some of the most memorable were the burn unit at Metro and the Palliative Care unit at The Cleveland Clinic.  The absolute unquestioned caring I saw in these doctors reminded me what it is that, to me, defines what a doctor should be.  This is not to say that this caring was not visible in every aspect of the hospital, only that it was most blatantly evident in those two places.  I am glad to have had this opportunity, and feel more prepared to make important decisions about my future career because of it., Disc Golf Disc golf is a sport which is a hobby of mine, and has provided me with a lot of relaxing enjoyment for almost ten years now.  It is a game similar to golf, except that you throw Frisbees toward target baskets.   The sport itself is enjoyable, and I enjoy the fact that when you play you are competing not only with those you are playing with, but also against yourself, trying to beat your personal best scores. Besides the sport itself however, I enjoy disc golf because the course locations are very frequently in beautiful wooded locations.  While playing the course, I am at the same time having a chance to enjoy nature, and to see many beautiful parks throughout the country., Research Coordinator I am in charge of a number of tasks related to a variety of research projects in the ophthalmology department.  I am also writing and editing several papers within the department.  My duties have thus far have been varied.  I was in charge of editing a paper and ensuring that it was ready for submission to a journal.  I am also working on contacting a number of patients for a follow up study on long term visual outcome.  I have performed a number of literature searches, and in one case I am using the papers I find in order to write up the original draft of a case report, with the intention of submitting it for publication.  In order to write up this paper, and to work for them in general, I have had to learn an incredible amount about ophthalmology in a very short time.  I originally knew very little about the field, but my learning curve has been sharp out of necessity.  One of the papers that I worked on has been submitted for publication with my name on it.  This is my first experience working in a research setting, and while I was initially nervous, I have found myself not only capable, but actually quite skilled at the tasks I have thus far been asked to perform.  I am looking forward to continued work here, and to continued exposure to the many different steps of the research process., RBC/Apheresis donation coordinator I began attending Red Cross blood drives my Freshman year in college.  I initially tried to convice as many people as I could to come along with me.  The problem that we kept running into was that there was always a very long wait, and they often had to send people home becasue they simply could not see them all that day. Luckily, there was a Red Cross only about 10 minutes from campus.  By my Junior year, I had a farily steady group of people that I could convince to go to these drives, and I was always looking for more.  It was at this point that I found out about the Red Cross near by, and so I was able to organize people to go to donate more often.   During one of my trips, I met Rick, and he talked to me and a few others about apheresis.  I began to be intersted in this as well and tried to convince people to join me in this endeavor as well as the RBC donation.  This was a much more difficult pull, as you had to be hooked up for at least 45 minutes and often longer.  I did manage to get a small group together for this purpose a few different times, and still manage to bring people with me when I go. I enjoy the challenge of convincing people to come with me, and I always hope that people will be insired to return on their own, and even to tell others to start donating., Habitat for Humanity I began going to Habitat for Humanity in the summer after I graduated in order to keep myself busy and serve my community while looking for a job.  My experience with them was incredible.  I worked daily with dedicated individuals, as well as with the current and future owners of the homes that I was helping to build.   Going so frequently allowed me to continue certain projects all of the way through to the end, which was incredibly fulfilling.  For example, I spent 4 days roofing a house and was incredibly proud at the end of the final day to be able to look at the finished product and know that I had done my part. I enjoyed the organization so much that I began bringing my younger sister when she was available.  By the end of my time there, I was proficient in many of the main tasks completed by volunteers, and I was almost daily put in charge of certain projects with a number of volunteers working under my supervision.  This volunteer experience allowed me to really get a sense of what it means to serve your community.  It also gave me insight into myself, and into my own leadership capabilities.  I intend to continue service throughout my career in medicine, and intend to start volunteering at a group home near where I just moved once I have settled in., Customer Service Representative I began working at Blockbuster in High School, but returned for my summer vacation, and for my winter break during my Sophmore year in college.  My bosses immediately recognized that I was much more motivated than the average employee and gave me many more responsibilities than my co-workers.  I developed a new way to return movies back to the shelf in order to save time, and my boss had me teach it to the other employees at our store. More importantly though, I learned to deal with an ubeleivable amount of complaints while working there.  The complaints were often unfounded and yet it was my job to treat every customer well, regardless of how they treated me or my bosses.  This allowed me to gain a tremedous amount of patience with people, as well as a respect for my bosses, who had to smile as people looked down on them.  It saddened me to see how they were treated, but inspired me to see how they reacted to it.  I feel that the main thing that I obtained from this job was the conviction that I would make sure that I never treated people the way that I saw people treat my bosses., Physician shadowing I have been able to observe some surgical procedures, and to shadow for a short time in the clinic at the eye institute.  I am very grateful to be able to have this kind of exposure to this field, and I am hopeful that I will make contacts in other fields at USF in order to have similar experiences in other fields., EMT training I recently took a course designed to prepare me to become a certified Emergency Medical Technician.  The course was designed to teach basic life saving skills, and was quite interesting, and kept me focused on the medical field.  I was able to ride with my instructor on a few occasions, as I had one of the highest grades in the class.  Now that I am settled in a permanent location, I am excited to take the final test and begin serving the community as an EMT.  I hope to gain valuable clinical experience, while at the same time shifting the focus of my service closer to my final goal., Scuba Certification I went to Honduras with my brother and my Aunt this summer and became scuba certified.  While there is no warm water scuba diving available in my area, I am incredibly excited to use my certification to my advantage.  I hope to save the money this year to go on a trip somewhere with my brother and continue this new hobby. Learning to scuba dive was exhilarating, and the beauty is absolutely awe inspiring.  I cannot wait until my next trip, and enjoy knowing that this is something I will be able to continue with for the rest of my life., Tutor I worked as a tutor for high school students, teaching Biology and Physics.  This job helped me to keep in contact with the sciences during my year off, and also helped me to fine tune some of my teaching skills.  I have helped many of my brothers and sisters as well as my friends when they were stuck in certain classes, but I had never taught in a formal setting before this.  I saw many of the students a number of times, some of them coming weekly to be sure they kept up, and some of the coming numerous times a week to cram for a midterm or final.  My goal with each student was to ensure comprehension of the material, as well as to help them develop the study skills necessary to learn for themselves.  While teaching, I had to learn to deal with occasional failure alongside my successes.  Not every student immediately improved, despite what I tried, and some students, I felt, never improved.  However, the majority of students became much more enthusiastic about the subject, and began performing much better.  I was always happy to see the change in those students, but at the same time, I did not give up on the students who continued to have a difficult time.  I learned valuable teaching skills along with fortitude by working with these students., Tutor My experiences here were similar with those at the Ivy Room.  The only significant difference is that with this service I also taught the SAT, chemistry and math.  I spent a lot of time ensuring that I was well prepared in order to tutor in such a variety of subject areas.  I learned through both of these jobs that learning and teaching will certainly be a constant and consistent part of my life, and the thought of this excites me., Student Facilities Assistant-Case Western Reserve University My initial duties in this job involved working with a number of other students to repair and to set up the residences on campus before students returned for the next school year.  We were also in charge of setting up rooms for conferences, and for fixing them up after the confrences were over.   As the summer went on, my bosses realized that I was often able to figure out what needed to be done on my own, as I was on the actual job site, and so they often put me in charge of a group of my co-workers for the day.  The actual work was not often mentally challenging, but the leadership position that I was placed in was.  I had to prove to my co-workers that I was actually competant to lead them, as well as work at least as hard as them if not harder.  I also had to motivate them to get their work done, which was not always easy, as we were paid by the hour, not by the job, and as our supervision was often fairly lax.  I feel that I gained a lot of experience through my attempts and sucesses at leading others to work hard in this job., Sexual Assault Task Force, Student Member When joining this group, I truly did not expect to enact the kind of change that we were able to in the single year that I was a member.  The people that I worked with were all equally passionate about this issue, and we all worked incredibly hard to achieve our goals.   We were able to a be a part of an entirely new sexual assault policy which was at the end of the year being brought forward to student and faculty groups throughout campus.  When the next school year begins, the changes suggested by these groups will be implemented into the new policy, and it will hopefully be accepted. The previous policy was hopelessly inadequate, and our hope was that with better information, and a more clear policy, the incidence of sexual assault, as well as the help available for victims will be greatly increased on our campus. Besides the obvious benefit of seeing our work go for something good, I also enjoyed the group for its own sake.  In this group I was able to work with many individuals who I probably would never have had an opportunity to collaborate with had we not shared similar goals and interests regarding sexual assault on our campus."

    "text": "On a hot summer night, a young man driving home from a graveyard shift fell asleep at the wheel, crossed over into oncoming traffic and hit a minivan head-on. The force and angle of the crash caused him to slide out from beneath his seatbelt and strike his head on the pavement. As the first person to arrive at the scene, I prepared to start working on the young man. Coincidentally, a doctor arrived and began the first response on the young man, allowing me to attend to the individuals in the minivan. They were in satisfactory condition, aside from headaches and a case of whiplash, so they remained on the curb with each other until the ambulances arrived.   Unfortunately, the injuries the young man sustained were too great and he did not make it to the hospital alive. The news struck my heart. During the next few days, the accident scene kept replaying in my mind. Could I have done more I have always dreamed of helping others, and this accident helped to direct that desire towards a career in medicine.  My work as a student athletic trainer in high school provided opportunities in caring for patients in a clinical environment rather than a trauma scene. As part of the athletic training program, the director of the athletic training program would take us to the hospital she was based at to be exposed to physical therapy in an outpatient setting. I was able to take that information back to the high school and assist athletes in their daily training, to heal, but more importantly, to prevent injuries. I discovered I wanted experience not just during the trauma, but during the aftermath as well. I have also been a member of many different sports teams since a young age, including soccer and baseball. I am not the best athlete at any one sport, but I am athletic and can contribute to any team. I have been managing a Sunday morning softball team of my peers for three years. I know that as a player, there are members of the team whose skills surpass my own. I also know that I excel at organizing a season, taking care of the finances, creating lineups that keep the players content and the team competitive, all while contributing with my own athletic performance. I value the camaraderie that has come from participating on this team, and look forward to perhaps leading a team of my fellow doctors in the hospital after my education. I have been fortunate enough to experience many different facets of medicine. While at the Cleveland Clinic, I had an opportunity to connect with a diverse population of patients, which taught me that healing is about the whole patient. I realized it is relatively easy to set a bone or prescribe a drug. Caring for any patient involves getting them to follow a treatment plan, dealing with health insurance, limiting and managing any setbacks, while keeping their outlook positive. Participating as an undergraduate researcher in addition to my full-time technical position at a biotechnology corporation has widened my appreciation of scientists behind the medicine. While at the ACTRIMS conference on multiple sclerosis in Washington, D.C., the impact and necessity for research in medicine was apparent. Innovative treatments for diseases are developed through hours of dedication by researchers working side-by-side with physicians to determine the mechanisms of disease. As a member of the scientific team at Copernicus Therapeutics, I experienced the first real taste of having people rely on my knowledge. In this position, I have enhanced my decision-making as well as my innovation skills. For example, I took it upon myself to reinvent the ordering system by writing code for an automated Excel worksheet, which saves the staff time searching for the correct products, while saving paper, time and redundancies on the accounting end of the process. In addition to my assigned tasks as a molecular biologist, I have also taken on a separate project using -Galactosidase to visualize the effectiveness of our drug delivery system. My position at Copernicus gave me an opportunity to rely on and apply my own knowledge and skills. Besides the science work in the lab, I have experienced the human side of research. I recently met a family with two young boys who have Cystic Fibrosis. It was remarkable how thankful the parents were that our company was searching for advancements that may eventually lead to a cure for their children. It was as if for at least that day, I was working for those children alone. Exposure to the many sides of medicine has helped me realize that I have already commenced my journey to heal. I am committed to dedicating my life to medicine, which was bolstered when I came upon the young man in the accident. From the research-side, I have learned the background behind the final products used in patient care. While connecting with patients, I realized how knowledge of what is happening serves to ease tensions. At a for-profit company, I learned the balance between the service and product we manufacture under the pressure of a financial bottom-line. Each opportunity in my life has been combined into a repertoire of abilities that will allow me to serve others with care and understanding through a career in medicine. Student Teaching Aide As a student teaching aide for the embryology course offered at Baldwin Wallace College, I was responsible for setting up zebrafish breeding pairs for the student's lab projects as well as designing an RNA isolation protocol that students could complete within the scheduled laboratory timeframe. I demonstrated proper lab techniques and was available as a tutor for the students during and after scheduled lab times to help refine their research projects and address any questions or concerns about class material.  While I was a histology teaching aide, most of my time was dedicated to the student's learning by reviewing histological slides and pointing out locations of the different cells types of various tissues. I helped the student's relate the structures they were viewing to the corresponding functions they were learning about in lecture., Embryology Lab Employee During my time employed in the embryology laboratory, I was responsible for the management of zebrafish habitats and animal husbandry, in addition to organizing and maintaining the general laboratory area. Later in my employment, I was able to perform tasks such as RNA isolation, embryo harvesting, and regulation of the genetic mutant zebrafish., Summer Scholars Program (SSP) During the Summer Scholars Program, I performed research in the developmental biology lab at Baldwin Wallace, under the direction of Dr. Jacqueline Morris. I worked under the funding of the SSP, and received additional funding from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society grant obtained by Dr. Morris. The research was conducted on two genes in the zebrafish genome that have the possibility of effecting myelination in the brain. The results of this research were presented to the rest of the Summer Scholars, and were the topic of my senior exit seminar. Additionally I was able to combine my findings with previous work and present the information at the ACTRIMS national conference in Washington, D.C. Currently I am orchestrating collaboration between my current employers and Dr. Morris that may further advance this research., Military Care Package Day Helped collect and donate materials to be sent overseas to military personnel., Cashier/Customer Service Clerk I began this job when I was almost sixteen, to help my family financially as best I could, while still maintaining my grades in high school. This ended up averaging to be about twenty-two hours per week. I started as a bagger, and then quickly progressed to become a cashier. After that, I was the informal Training Manager, responsible for training any new hires, directing them through their computer training before actually training them on the cash register and compiling a database of the new employees and their training regiment. I spent a year performing those tasks until I was moved up to the customer service desk. I ended up taking a sabbatical from Giant Eagle the summer between my junior and senior years of high school to work at my grandparents hobby shop., Copernicus Therapeutics Inc. I currently work at Copernicus Therapeutics, Inc. under the title of Research Assistant I - Molecular Biology. Copernicus is currently funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation with the hopes of developing a novel gene therapy system applicable to Cystic Fibrosis as well as other diseases such as Retinitis Pigmentosa and Parkinson's disease. Phase I clinical trials have already been completed and work is progressing from the results of that trial towards further clinical trials. At Copernicus, I am responsible for such tasks as plasmid design and construction, subcloning, RT-PCR, gel electrophoresis, protein detection assays, and murine lung tissue harvest and processing. I have also begun to update some of the computer files and programs there to help bring the Information Technology levels up to current standards., Job Shadowing Dr. Kawalek I experienced a side of medicine that was not in a hospital or private practice setting while shadowing and volunteering with Dr. Kawalek. At the Chrysler plant, I experienced the management of acute and chronic injuries in a work related setting. The job required testing of the hearing and eyesight of the employees as a preventative measure. It also required that the employees were educated on the proper use of personal protective equipment., Softball I have played on multiple softball teams for five years.  Seasons start around May and can last until the beginning of October.  I enjoy all of the teams I am on, and continually look to add more.  Last season I played regularly on 3 teams, and was a substitute on another team.  I plan on continuing to play softball as long as possible. Last year I also took over as manager of the team., Baldwin Wallace College Dean's List I qualified for the Dean's List for each of the eight semesters I attended Baldwin Wallace College., Cleveland Clininc Foundation Volunteering I spent every Monday in the Kaiser Emergency Room at the Cleveland Clinic. Much of my time was spent preparing the rooms, taking care of patient needs, transporting patients around the hospital, and taking basic vitals. Additionally, I was able to see just how an ER was run, and the intricate relationship between doctors, nurses, and patients. It was very satisfying to be able to help the patients and their families in whatever way I could, which usually amounted to answering some of their questions, or getting them some basic items. It was also very beneficial to talk with the physicians about their experiences during college and medical school, as well as finding out why they wanted to become doctors. The experiences I obtained volunteering at the Clinic as well as volunteering as an athletic trainer were entirely rewarding, and served to bolster my desires to become a physician., Student Athletic Trainer I was the student athletic trainer for the ladies soccer, basketball, and softball teams for two years in high school. During this time, I learned many first aid techniques as well as rehabilitation strategies and planning. It was also my responsibility to become a liaison between the coaches and the athletes, and to look out for the best interest of the athletes above that of any strong desires of winning the coaches may have held. The head athletic trainer at the school, Beth Csiszar, was also very helpful in directing me towards a career in medicine, guiding me to my first in-hospital experiences. She was able to take the group of six student volunteer trainers to Southwest General Hospital on various occasions. We participated in a tour of the LifeFlight facilities and helicopter, received instruction by a nutritionist on the topic of athlete health, and took a tour of the rest of the hospital, among other activities., Iggle Video Clerk I went back to work at Giant Eagle the fall of my senior year and entered into the Iggle Video department almost immediately. I worked there for a little over five years, through my last year in high school and my entire college career, averaging between 22-25 hours per week. Again, I was responsible for training any new hires in the department in addition to the regular tasks of customer service. I parted ways on good terms, leaving to pursue employment at Copernicus Therapeutics, Inc., AMSA member Medical student organization providing members with access to iinformation on the new topics in medicine.  This organization also runs health fairs which include the latest information on current medical schools and professions., ACTRIMS National Conference Poster presentation entitled Antibody screen of insertional zebrafish mutants identifies novel genes involved in myelination was given at the America's Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) annual meeting in Washington DC. The poster was one of 46 chosen to present at this national conference. The work detailed by the poster was completed during my junior and senior years in the Developmental Biology lab under the direction of Dr. Jacqueline Morris, a large portion completed during the Summer Scholars Program at Baldwin Wallace. The abstract for this poster was also published in the journal of abstracts for the meeting., Pre-Medical Socitey The Pre-Medical Society at Baldwin Wallace consisted of bi-weekly meetings to inform pre-medical students about the latest information, technology, and research in the medical field. Community service projects were performed and speakers employed in the field of medicine were brought to give various seminars."

    "text": "TRAUMA STAT: STAB WOUND, ETA: 5 MIN. Unfortunately, I received this type of page too often on my research assistant pager. This time it happened on a Friday afternoon and my shift was over in 5 minutes, however I could not pass up the opportunity to stay late to see what was coming in. After all, this was one of the biggest benefits of working in the Emergency Department of a Level 1 trauma center. The amount of medical personnel gathering in the Shock and Resuscitation Unit indicated that this case was worse than most. Little did I know that 15 minutes later my desire to enter into the medical field would be firmly reinforced.  From the time the paramedics burst through the door to the time the doctors announced the time of death, I found myself completely wrapped up in what was going on around me. The single stab wound to the lateral wall of the thoracic cavity; the infusion of blood to prevent the patient from bleeding out; the trauma surgeons opening up the thoracic cavity and suturing what turned out to be a puncture wound to the cardiac tissue; the repeated use of an internal defibrillator in an attempt to stimulate the heart. Driving home a half hour later I was still saddened at the tragic ending of another life, yet I could hardly contain my excitement at what I had just witnessed.  Relaying this amazing course of events, I was surprised others did not share my enthusiasm and excitement. In retrospect, this series of events culminated in the first time that I knew beyond a doubt that medicine was my true calling. Since then, I have had a number of equally significant experiences that, while not as dramatic, have confirmed my decision to enter into medicine. More importantly, I have experienced many things that have helped me develop the dedication and character strengths necessary to be a great doctor.  In addition to my work in the Emergency Department, I have had the benefit of volunteering at Crossroad Health Center, a non-profit urban health clinic. Here, I have witnessed first hand the necessity of providing basic care to members of the community that are often overlooked and underrepresented. I've had the opportunity to experience the less glamorous but equally important side of medicine. Caring, compassion, empathy, and a willingness to help are a few traits that have been strengthened in me through my experiences with the patients and staff at Crossroad. One particularly meaningful experience came when a nurse asked for help with a difficult patient. Upon entering, I saw a young boy lying on the table, crying his eyes out because he was afraid to have staples taken out of a gash on his leg. Nothing the nurse or his mother said would change his mind; he thrashed violently any time the nurse came near him. Charged with holding his leg, I talked with the boy to understand why he was so scared. As he explained how much it hurt when the staples were put in, I assured him that having them removed would be much easier. After telling him how brave he was and how cool his friends would think his scar was, he finally allowed the nurse to remove the staples, much to the amazement of the nurse and his mother. Experiences such as this have been meaningful to me in my pursuit of a medical career because it reinforces that I can relate to a wide range of patients and that I have the ability to make people feel at ease.  I can't point back to the exact moment when I knew I wanted to be a doctor. However, given my strong inclination towards the sciences from the time I was young, my choice of medicine is not too great a leap. Yet, upon leaving college I did not feel as though I was ready to undertake such a rigorous course of study along with the financial burden of medical school when I still had much debt from undergraduate schooling. Furthermore, I wanted to immerse myself in the healthcare field to make sure that the reality of medicine and the healthcare environment was consistent with my own vision. I have been satisfied with every answer to this concern.  As my journey through college and beyond has led me to pursue a career in medicine, I look back and fondly recall so many of the experiences where I have left my mark. What I did not expect is the lasting impression these experiences have left on me. My classroom work has taught me the value and reward of hard work and dedication. My persistence in studying for the MCAT has taught me that if I want something badly enough, there is nothing that will prevent me from achieving it. My volunteer and clinical activities have taught me about maturity, responsibility, compassion, sensitivity and perspective. Most importantly, the cumulative result of my journey is the revelation that medicine is truly a passion of mine.   When a person talks about their passion, they take on a fascinating demeanor. Their enthusiasm is contagious and it is apparent to those around them that this person genuinely loves the subject at hand. When talking about my desire to become a doctor and my interest in medicine, my pulse quickens and my tone changes. My passion for the art of medicine will not only allow me to thrive in the arduous medical education process, but it will also be apparent to the many patients I will help throughout my career. Caducea - University of Cincinnati As a member of Caducea, an organization for Pre-Medical students, I was given the opportunity to attend meetings that addressed many different aspects of the field of medicine. I was able to listen to current med school students discuss their experiences, to listen to the med school faculty discuss admissions requirements/procedures, as well as to listen to various area doctors describe their fields of specialization., Upper Level Honors Recognition - UC Honors Program Graduated with the highest level Honors Certificate granted (Upper Level) as a result of completing at least 36 credit hours in Honors level courses., Dean's List in College of Engineering and A&S I received Dean's List recognition in the majority of my quarters at UC for attaining a GPA of 3.4 or higher for the entire quarter., Physician Shadowing I shadowed local doctors to get a better feel for the nature of their work, as well as how they deal with different issues that arise in the medical field., Intramural Sports - UC I took part in various intramural sports while at UC, such as football, soccer, basketball, and softball. This was an important element of college for me because it allowed me to further develop my relationships with my current friends, as well as to meet new people. Furthermore, intramurals provided a way for me to balance the academic side of college with the social aspect, which I feel is imperative for college success., Tutoring in Calculus/Chemistry I tutored in calculus and chemistry for a year and a half. One of my students went from an F to a B in Calculus, which allowed him to graduate with honors and gain acceptance to his first choice of colleges., Volunteer - Crossroad Health Clinic I volunteer at an urban clinic in downtown Cincinnati to gain experience in the family practice setting. Additionally, this gives me experience in working with an underserved population and seeing first hand the benefits of providing basic level health care to all members of the community., Head Coach, 7th/8th Grade Girls' Soccer Team I was a head coach for a 7th/8th grade girls' soccer team at my childhood grade school for 4 seasons. This consisted of a 6 hour/week commitment. In my 4 years of coaching, the turnout for soccer players in this age group doubled. This position provided leadership experience as well as opportunity to facilitate team cohesion., Teaching Assistant - UC Honors Freshman Seminar I was one of 24 Honors students chosen to be a T.A. for the first ever Honors Freshman Seminar class at UC. This involved close corroboration with the instructor and my peers in order to work out the kinks of the class. I was able to listen to a different speaker every week and then conduct a session with 20 freshmen to discuss the speech. I was also given the opportunity to help these students out with the transition into their first quarter at college, as well as to help refine the course for the next year., Customer Service Representative - Comair I work as a gate agent for Comair at the CVG Int'l Airport. Here, I work under extreme pressure on a regular basis, where fast decision making is essential. I have developed outstanding customer service and people skills while working this job, and I feel these skills will only help me in the future to deal with patients who are experiencing difficult times. Similarly I think this job has helped me to realize the necessity of clear decision making under duress, while also making a decision that is in the best interest of everyone involved., Clinical Study Assistant - Emergency Department I worked over 1500 hours in the Emergency Department at University, Christ, and Jewish hospitals as a research assistant. My responsibilities included working with the Emergency Department nurses and doctors to identify patients that fit inclusion criteria for ongoing research trials and then talking to the patient or the patient's family to obtain consent. I also carried out study related procedures, such as blood or CSF banking, POC testing, and performing Audicor and BioZ recordings., Zimmer Inc., Orthopaedic Trauma Division - Co-op While a student in the Biomedical Engineering program, I had the opportunity to work on a co-op job with Zimmer Orthopaedics. During this time, I was exposed to many of the company's trauma products as well as joint replacement products. I was also able to observe a femoral nail placement in a cadaver. This experience was enriching because it allowed me to see the behind the scenes brainstorming and innovation that arises due to the numerous complications that surface in the medical field., Laboratory Processing Technician - ViaCord Work as a lab processing technician for ViaCord Cord Blood Banking and Research Center. Here, I perform a number of lab duties necessary in receiving outside cord blood samples and processing them to isolate the hematopoietic stem cells for cryopreservation."

    "text": "The accelerating innovations of medical technology will exponentially increase man's power to cure disease, but in this changing environment, the physician must never overlook the needs of the individual.  My undergraduate training in biomedical engineering has helped me gain the conceptual skills to harness this evolving technology, but through experiences in medicine and the community, I have developed a more complete view of medicine.  Medicine encompasses my interests, my ideals, and my talents.  Much like a career in medicine, wilderness leadership requires a dichotomy of hard and soft skills.  Last spring break when faced wtih unexpected below zero temperatures in Southern Utah both of these skills were tested.  For weeks, my co-leader and I checked and re-checked gear lists, poured over topographical maps, and discussed every possible contingency.  Advanced preparation and technical savvy allowed us to set camp rapidly.  After the participants were settled, we stayed out in the blizzard for another hour boiling water to be placed in the participants' sleeping bags to stave off frost bite.  Servant leadership is critical in the wilderness because it fosters motivation and trust in those you lead. Trust was tested throughout the rest of this demanding trip when crossing frozen creeks and rallying packs up cliff walls but the team never wavered.  Having learned first hand the importance of team cooperation and strong leadership, I look forward to applying these qualities in a clinical setting.  One of the fundamentally most important experiences of my undergraduate career was my research in the Minnesota Muscle lab.  My project is the computational modeling of the dynamic fluctuations of muscle proteins.  I myself began just as this project did, as a blank slate.  Communicating my results did not at first come naturally.  I had trouble putting the complex data that I generated in computer simulations in the language of the experimentalists.  It was only by learning to see my project from the perspective of my collaborators that I was able to be most effective as a researcher because without complete communication, collaboration cannot truly occur.  The ability to internalize and communicate complex scientific ideas will be invaluable as the landscape of medical technology continues to develop.  As a volunteer at Hennepin County Medical Center in the Emergency Department, I have learned to interact in new ways.  The madness of my first day exposed me to a diversity of patients and ailments that my suburban mind could scarcely imagine.  The most striking moment of that day was translating for a sick Hispanic infant's parents.  Despite being very nervous, I was able to successfully obtain the necessary information, help the couple access medical care, and ease their fears.  As a volunteer, I use blankets, ice water, crackers, and most importantly conversation to make patients as physically and mentally comfortable as possible.  The opportunity to make a small positive contribution to their care has been very rewarding, but I always wish that I had the training to take the next step.  My work with the Y-Scholars gave me a different perspective on the cultural diversity of Minneapolis than I could gain in a hospital setting alone.  This past year I was the site coordinator for Afrocentric Middle School where we facilitated activities such as the egg drop, bacterial growth, and college knowledge jeopardy.  The transition from the chaos and reluctance of the students on the first day to the familiarity and enthusiasm of the last was amazing.  I think the change in the program reflected a transition in how the students and I perceived each other.  My perception changed from one of helping at risk youth to the perspective of a proud mentor and teacher of gifted minds.  This experience has taught me that labels act as lenses through which I view others' behavior.  An example of a student for which this was true was Perion.  At first, he was difficult to work with, just as his teacher had predicted, but as the weeks went on I could see that he was really talented.  I found common ground in basketball and we played almost every week after he'd finished his homework.  Over the weeks he slowly became a leader in the program, but we both had to get over our assumptions to get there.  I am now aware that these assumptions are everywhere.  I think that they are natural and can even be useful in some instances, but I am constantly working toward seeing beyond their limitations.  My experience with the Y-Scholars has profoundly affected the way I view the world and will make me a more conscientious, empathetic doctor.  Engineering and research have broadened and deepened my interest in the biomedical sciences while volunteering has taught me to embrace diversity.  This wide variety of interests has prepared me to adapt and lead the changing field of medicine in an ethical way.  As a doctor, I hope to combine community service, research, and individualized care in a meaningful and synergistic way.  A degree in medicine is not the end goal, it is an opportunity to share my hard work and passion with the world in the best way I know how. HCMC Emergency Dept. Research Associate As a research associate I gather data for a number of ongoing clinical research projects in the Emergency Department at Hennepin County Medical Center.  Using EMSTAT, I identify patients that fit the criteria for our studies.  After identifying patients, I obtain informed consent and perform the study.  These studies cover everything from asthma education, to a comparison of drugs used for procedural sedations.  The data I obtain includes blood pressure, pulse rate, pulse oximetry, and capnography.  I also record a time course for stabalizations in the department.  Through this I have seen and began to understand the chaos of a medical emergency., Minnesota Supercomputing Institute Summer Intern For the past 16 months I have worked continuously in the biophysics lab of Dr. David D. Thomas called Minnesota Muscle.  My responsibilities include performing my own individual research in which I study the dynamics of muscle proteins through a variety of computational methods.  Of particular interest to our lab is the orientation and motion of spin labels and fluorescent labels in relation to the protein.  By understanding the motion of the probe in atomic detail and validating its simulated motions with those observed experimentally we are able to gain insights into the molecular mechanism of muscle contraction that would be unattainable through experiment or computation alone.  I am also responsible for teaching graduate students to use molecular modeling techniques and for presenting my results to the lab on an approximately bimonthly basis. I work approximately 60 hours per week in the summer and about 10 hours per week during the school year.  In my time in the Thomas lab, computational support for abstracts at the annual Biophysical Society meeting has increased from zero to four.  This year we expect at least seven abstracts to include computational data., Hennepin County Medical Center Emergency Dept. Volunteer I work as a triage departement volunteer at Hennepin County Medical Center in downtown Minneapolis.  In this positon I assist the triage nurses.  I take patients to their rooms, clean beds, Posters at 2006 Biophysical Society Meeting In all three of these posters I provided molecular dynamics simulation data validated by experiment.  This technique allows the verification of atomic models such as crystal structures by comparing spectrum obtained Electron Paramagnetic Spectroscopy to those simulated from the crystal structure model.  This required learning quantum mechanical and molecular mechanics techniques.  I used supercomputers for this work, and I learned a great deal about managing my own projects.  Each simulation can take several months, which had facilitated improvement of my planning skills.  Conformational Heterogeneity in the Myosin II Actin-Binding Cleft.    Jennifer C. Klein, Adam R.

Thomas, PhD, YMCA Volunteers for a Day Coordinator In response to the large number of college students that are genuinely good people but feel too overwhelmed to make a long term commitment to volunteering, I co-founded a student group with two of my peers.  The group seeks to provide one time volunteer opportunities in a variety of settings to help the one time volunteers to find something that they are passionate about.  It is in the spirit of the YMCA's goal to build community.  Last year we offered about 10 events ranging from maintanence work at a homeless shelter, to babysitting for the Salvation Army Christmas party, to marshalling a 5K.  We involved over 100 volunteers.  This year we are hoping to double the program's size and reach even more people., International Society of Magnetic Resonance Research 2005 In the spring and fall semesters of 2004, I built and tuned this dual tuned volume coil for H imaging and P spectroscopy of the human head at 7T.  There were a total of sixteen microstrip components in the coil.  Each had to be carefully placed and then precisely tuned.  Finally, we obtained phantom and human head images to test the coil and obtain data for the poster.  This was an interesting and exctiing culmination to several months of diligent work.   A Dual-tuned Microstrip Volume Coil Array for Human Head Parallel 1H/31P MRI/MRS at 7T  Xiaoliang Zhang, Adam R Burr, Xiao-Hong Zhu, Gregor Adriany, Kamil Ugurbil,Wei Chen, Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program My primary research was the translation of a program from C into Visual Basic to shim a magnetic field very rapidly in a superconducting magnet.  During my time in this lab we passively shimmed the 5T magnet by placing pieces of metal in the bore until the field was very homogenous.  It required iteratively mapping the field and adjusting the shims until a sufficiently homogeneous field was obtained.  This required learning to keep a very detailed lab notebook, as not every shim attempt improved the field.  After several months, the magnet was shimmed to better than factory specifications.  My time here helped me become more precise in my work and to increase my creative problem solving ability., Tau Beta Pi Membership Tau Beta Pi is a national honors fraternity that is offered to students of distinguished scholarship and exemplary character as undergraduates in engineering.  Each year the members of the society tutor undergraduates and buy educational toys for underprivileged youth in Minneapolis., YMCA Environmental Backpacking Program Coordinator The Environmental Backpack Program is a 25 year old backpacking program that  seeks to build a community of environmentally minded students through weekly seminars and large spring break trips.  During my three semester term as coordinator, the program more than doubled in size and obtained private funding for a biannual service trip to work on the North Country Trail.  I have led trips to the Porcupine Mountains, the Smoky Mountains National Park, Olympic National Park, and Escalante National Monument.  In doing so I introduced over 50 peers to the practice of Leave No Trace backpacking and was able to help educate several times as many at our weekly seminars which featured topics such as sustainable development, living toxin free, building pop can stoves, and backcountry cooking., George Williams Fellowship Award The George Williams Fellowship Award was founded in 1951 to honor exceptional volunteers and leaders at the University YMCA.  The award is named after George Williams who founded the international YMCA movement.  The winners of the award embody the spirit of service and community.  Since 1951 approximately 500 men and women have received this award., University YMCA Y-Scholars Staff Member The Y-Scholars program seeks to increase the graduation rate of North Minneapolis Public Schools through tutoring, mentoring, and career exploration.  The  programs members split their time between middle school sites and primarily Somalian  immigrant high schools.  My job in this program was as site coordinator for Afrocentric Middle School where I planned and facilitated weekly activities and led three field trips to colleges and universities in the Minneapolis area.  The key aspect of this program is the strong bonds formed between the youth and the leaders.  I also facilitated several weekly seminars dealing with issues that faced our youth such as homelessness, diversity, and poverty., YMCA Coordinators Scholarship This award is given to the leaders of the programs at the University YMCA.  I have received this award on three seperate occasions for my coordination of the Environmental Backpacking Program.  I will receive it twice morethis year for coordinating the Y-Scholars Program., IT Merit Scholarship This award was given to 98 students of the Institute of Technology in2006 for outstanding academic achievement., Council of Campus YMCA's This conference unites the 19 remaining University YMCAs for a week of planning, discussion, and reflection.  I was chosen as one of seven delegates from among 600 volunteers at the Univeristy YMCA.  I was a member of the Alternative Spring Break Signature Program board for the 2005-2006 school year., Researcher - Radio Frequency Coils at 7 and 9.4 Tesla Working with Dr. Zhang so early in my research career was a great blessing.  We built and tuned radio frequency coils for use in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies at 9.4 Tesla at the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research.  Dr. Zhang taught me about the art of science.  Without extremely high precision construction of the coils, the images obtained will not attain the required resolution for these advanced studies.  I was tremendously lucky to work in a field of this great exactness so early because appreciating the precision required to do science was a very necessary lesson.  We built three coils.  One coil was designed to provide extremely accurate images of deep within the cat brain.  The second was a very large dual tuned coil designed that was designed to push the limits of spatial and temporal resolution available at 7 Tesla with the goal of better understanding the transmission of visual stimuli in the brain.  The final coil was designed to study the effect of stem cells on ischemic tissue in the rat leg, which showed improved vasculature with stem cell therapy.  The three projects progressed toward the goal of being able to make my own coils if I should choose to do MR research professionally while simultaneously introducing me to magnetic resonance imaging."

    "text": "As a young student, science and mathematics were always my passion.  While in high school, I had a great love for learning how the world works as well as how science is applied to helping improve people's quality of life.  Because of this, I pursued Biomedical Engineering in college, a field that integrates life science research and engineering to develop medical products.  Although I always admired the personal contact of the medical field, I was content to make long term contributions to improve people's lives.  However, in college several personal events reshaped my career goals.  My brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia, for which he must take medications with unpleasant side effects. A close personal friend with lupus was misdiagnosed early on as rheumatoid arthritis which led to an unnecessary hospitalization.  Furthermore, my brother-in-law was diagnosed with a patent ductus arteriosus which forces him to use oxygen tanks daily. These experiences led me to reflect on my career choice, and in the end I decided I wanted to make a more immediate difference in the lives of others by becoming a physician.      Because I had a limited grasp of the medical field at that time, I sought out experiences to shadow physicians.  I witnessed my first surgery as Dr. Michael Reed removed a Morgagni's hernia from a patient. I have had the opportunity to observe laparoscopic surgeries as well as a coronary bypass. By shadowing Dr. Marc Rothenberg, a world renowned expert in eosinophilic disorders, I was able to appreciate the interaction with patients, especially in how to effectively communicate the details of extremely complex diseases to a young patient all the while providing reassurance to concerned family members. However, I also witnessed many of the difficulties a modern physician faces such as the increasing costs of medical care on top of increasingly restrictive health management. All of these experiences revealed the many challenges a doctor faces but showed me the profound and immediate impact that a physician can make on a patient's quality of life.    While my desire for personal interaction in my career has been significantly strengthened, I have never lost  the desire to make long term contributions to the medical field.  Translational research is the lifeblood of modern medicine, and I wanted to contribute to the cause.  As such, I have spent many years in research environments to gain a better understanding of how scientists study diseases while further developing my analytical and science skills. During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to work for Dr. Karen Knudsen at the University of Cincinnati studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of metastatic prostate cancer, which is recalcitrant to therapeutic approaches used for earlier stages of the disease. My project involved looking at the effects of BAF57, an important upregulated protein that enhances the androgen receptor's activity and proliferation of prostate cancer cells. We hypothesized that ablating it could be used as a therapeutic approach to prostate cancer. I am currently a research assistant for Dr. Nives Zimmermann at Cincinnati Children's Hospital examining the role of eosinophils in allergic airway inflammation.  My overall goal is to investigate the role of a surface receptor in causing apoptosis of eosinophils. These experiences have given me a broader understanding of disease research as I have moved from in vitro models to animal models as well as utilizing patient samples. Also, these labs were great models for patient care driven research and I hope to carry the lessons learned there into my research career.  My experiences have not only allowed me to see how scientists today are studying the etiology of diseases but how they test innovative therapies that will be beneficial in the treatment of disease and improvement in the quality of life for patients.  One of the most attractive aspects of becoming a physician scientist is the ability to observe translational research applied to a clinical setting.  For example, the development of a drug now used to treat hypereosinophilic disorders stemmed from Dr. Rothenberg's research to understand the mechanisms of eosinophils in disease.  In addition, his research has furthered our understanding of the testing, diagnosis, and treatment of eosinophilic disorders through a multifactorial approach which includes the collaboration of physicians and research scientists.  His example allowed me to appreciate the impact that a physician scientist can make both on a single patient as well as a whole branch of medicine.     As an aspiring physician scientist I hope to not only treat patients, but also to advance the field of medicine by designing and innovating new treatments and preventive strategies resulting in better disease management. My education and experiences have laid a strong foundation for a career in medicine and I hope a medical education will further build the framework for a life of service to my community. My diligence, strong work ethic, experience in research and leadership positions, and a compassionate outlook on patient suffering will enable me to rise to the challenge of medical training in order to become an excellent physician. Bilirubin presentation As part of our senior design project, the group's objective was to design a device that would measure bilirubin in neonates non-invasively. The project was an invaluable learning experience and I was part of a cross disciplinary team working toward a medical device. Starting from an optical module that an electrical engineer designed, we had to integrate that to make a product that can be used in the medical environment. I learned from the industrial design students the process to build an ergonomically and aesthetically pleasing product while still be functional. We were able to interview nurses and doctors to clarify user requirements for the product which we named the Bili-Pen. Furthermore, we interviewed mothers to get their perspectives so that we can design a product that would suit them. We presented a poster presentation and demonstrated the device at the Ohio Valley Allied of Life Sciences annual meeting. It was a great experience of learning the process of making medical products and further validated my desire have a career in the medical field., Intramural Sports I find that physical activities are one of the best ways to improve one's mind and body. Therefore, I tried to be active as possible while getting others involved. Therefore, I organized team activities such as the basketball, football, softball, and soccer. I enjoyed organizing the teams because it will also improve building strengthened relationships and communications between friends while meeting new people. Furthermore, it helped me improve my leadership and management skills. One of the most fond memories that I have and still discussed among friends was how we were able to beat a heavily favorite undefeated team in the playoff not because we were athletically superior, but because of our strategy and game plan. And lastly, I find participating in sports helped relieve some stress., Alpha Phi Omega I have been with community service organization for four years and was the vice-president of fellowship during my senior year. I've completed at least of 20hrs of community service each quarter. Some events, just to name a few, werecleaning the streets of surrounding the campus, beautifying the surrounding parks, visiting nursing homes to help the elderlies, and assisting the local food pantry. I also did a service called Nightwalk on every Tuesday night in which I shuttled students in a van around campus and surrounding area if they did not feel safe walking to their destination. My favorite event was the annual Valentine's Day Dance in which we invited about 300 handicapped elementary and junior high school students to dance. I was the DJ for the event and it brought me joy to see the students having a good time. Furthermore, I was voted as the fellowship member of the year by the organization for all the activities I've done to foster fellowship. Some of these activities include intramural sports such as football, basketball, and soccer and having social gatherings such as game nights, banquet, and retreat. This was a successful student run organization because everyone wanted to give back to the campus and the community. I have enjoyed every activities as well as meeting people with similar desires., Publications in Dr. Karen Knudsen's Lab I have provided my technical skills that have resulted in a publication.   Title:RB status is a critical determinant of therapeutic response in prostate cancer cells.  Journal:Cancer Research 2007 67: 6192-6203.  Authors:Sharma, A; Comstock C; Knudsen ES; Cao K; Hess-Wilson J; Morey LM; Berrera J; Knudsen KE.  Title: Targeting the BAF57 SWI/SNF subunit in prostate cancer: a novel platform to control androgen receptor activity.  Journal: Cancer Research 2008 68:4551-8 Authors: 1.\tLink KA, Balasubramaniam S, Sharma A, Comstock CE, Godoy-Tundidor S, Powers N, Cao KH, Haelens A, Claessens F, Revelo MP, Knudsen KE., Co-op for biomedical engineering I wanted to understand what I've learned in the classroom and apply it to the field of biomedical engineering. My project involved the understanding of the current treatments of intracranial aneurysm and to develop a way to test them because of the relapse of aneurysm. Because I was the first member of the lab, my goal was to research and buy the necessary equipments to set up a laboratory for Dr. Haridas. Furthermore, I was exposed to technical computer software to do computational calculations and the learning has been invaluable for my senior design project. I was able to build a model of the cerebral vascular flow systems that is currently being used in the lab today. Overall, the experience has increased my understanding of testing and validation current technologies with the hope to improve the treatments and therefore patient care., Allergy/Immunology I was fortunate to be a research assistant for Dr. Nives Zimmermann where her focuses is to study the role and function of eosinophils. My goal is to characterize the function and signaling pathways of a surface receptor found on eosinophils that causes apoptosis upon dimerization. Although new to immunology, I was able to translate some of my previous experiences in techniques like PCR to make immediate contribution. Furthermore, I wanted to learn more about the field so I took an introductory class in immunology while working. The class has contributed to increased understanding of my own as well as other lab members' projects. Also, I learned of a laboratory model where collaboration between members can accelerate research. For example, one member of the lab has samples of mice inflamed tissues and I wanted to look at the expression of different genes, I could gain quick access to the cDNA. This process would take longer if I start the experiment from the point of inducing inflammation in mice. Furthermore, I have a better understanding of the translational research approach through my interactions with physician scientists., Volunteer at the environmental health I was mentored by a graduate student and learned techniques such as PCR and sequencing. I was able to carry out experiments using those techniques by myself and helped my mentor in his research. This experience exposed me to the research that is being done in the field of genetics and I gained valuable like techniques that could not be carried out in a class., Darwin T. Turner Program I was one of four out of 200 applicants that was selected for this scholarship program. I participated in our annual 10k Walk as One to promote racial justice. I received the Unsung Hero award in 2002 for helping a friend in need and the Outstanding Leadership award in 2005 for participating and leading in activities around campus. Lastly, I tutored students within the program., Research for Dr. Karen Knudsen Most of my undergraduate years working were spent in Dr. Karen Knudsen's Laboratory, where the focus is on prostate cancer.  At first my responsibilities include carrying out side projects of three mentors. I was introduced with new techniques such as immunohistochemistry, western blot, reporter assay, and chromatin precipitation assay. In my previous experiences, I was mostly a technician (learning a technique and use it to carry out an experiment). But as I become more involved in the laboratory, I was able to understand the hypothesis driven research and carry out experiments for my own project. I have gained experiences in presenting my data through a poster presentation for Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) at the University of Cincinnati and also presenting powerpoint presentations to the lab member of my experiments. The analyses, interpretations, and suggestions provided lab members have improved my analytical skills that were used to improve my experiments. Furthermore, my technical skills have resulted in two co-author publications in the Journal of Cancer Research., Tau Beta Pi This is an honor engineering organization and I was the Historian my first year, and then Vice-President of activities the following year. As Historian, my responsibility was to document the activities of the organization. At the end of the year banquet, I was responsible for the presentation of all the activities we've done. As VP of activities, I planned community service and social events for the organization. Some events include raising money and walking in the 5k walk Making Strides Against Breast Cancer and Prepare Affair in which we clean yards for low income and elderlies to better prepare them for winter. I also led the group in intramural sports such as volleyball and soccer. In addition to those activities, I repaired bicycles to be given away to low income family, tutored high school students in math, and assisted the engineering department in high school engineering competition. This organization allowed me an opportunity to provide service to the campus and the community while getting to know fellow engineering students."

    "text": "Timid at first, using her mother's shoulder to hide her face, Jordan, a patient just two years old whom I met this past summer while shadowing, would hardly look at me.  Physically, Jordan was your average two-year-old girl, the only exception being she was on the lower end of the growth charts for children her age.  Yet, her small stature could not begin to hide her large personality.  It didn't take long for her to start a game where she would wrap herself in the privacy curtain to hide from me while her parents and her physician, Dr. Reece, talked.  Although I tried to listen, Jordan had other plans.  When the visit was over, I went to give her a high five or sugar as her parents affectionately called it.  Instead I was greeted with a huge hug as well as a thank you.  Jordan was the kind of child you can't help but like.  She was very outgoing and full of energy, yet easily controlled.  Jordan was always happy and usually wore a big smile.  Very sweet and a good listener, she was also the kind of patient you hope to have, guaranteed to make your day a little brighter each time she came in.  Because my shadowing went on for a few months, I was lucky enough to see Jordan again.  On this visit, talks of removing a small mole on her wrist came up.  However, Dr. Reese concluded that there was no urgent need to have it removed. He also admitted that he didn't want Jordan to dislike him after performing a painful surgery.  For Jordan and I, however, the second visit was much like the first, without the timid beginning.  I share this story because, although simple, it really embodies my motivation for choosing to pursue a career in medicine.  For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be a doctor.  Granted, the initial aspiration probably stemmed from a desire to follow my father's footsteps.  But, since then, my motivations have come from my own life experiences.  These experiences have all pointed me to a career in medicine.  While at Ball State University, I dabbed in many of the world's sciences as I have always found science the most interesting topic.  I immediately gravitated to biology as I found it the most fascinating.  Learning the intricate details about life's ability to exist really stimulated my intellect.  This was true of other related disciplines too, including physiology and anatomy, as well as the social sciences.  Classes about the human psyche and social interactions were among my favorite electives.  These classes helped solidify my choice of a career in the medical field.  I have never looked back on my choice to study biology or the eventual hope and desire to study medicine.  And I still don't, even after I was denied acceptance to medical school.  As expected, I was distressed when I learned I didn't get into medical school the first time around (2007).  I had worked so hard to become what I thought was a competitive candidate.  At the time, it was one of the largest personal disappointments of my life.  Yet, I never would have let this alone deter me.  To continue my education, I applied to graduate school at Ball State.  Soon, more discouraging news came when I was told that my trouble with the law put me at a real disadvantage as a medical school applicant (I have been charged with two misdemeanors, no convictions, both for alcohol related offenses and both before I was twenty-one).  This news, coupled with my newfound passion in research, led me to do what I thought necessary in exploring other career options, and ultimately led to my enrollment into a Ph.D. program at the University of Cincinnati and Cincinnati Children's Hospital.  My time in Cincinnati, however, established that research lacked something I greatly needed in my career.  Research was new and exciting.  It was intellectually stimulating and it directly led to medical advances and therapies used to save lives.  However, what it lacked was a human element that I strongly desire.  I cannot interact with nor touch the lives of the cells that I cultured or the animals I kept, and I greatly enjoy interacting with people, children especially.  I have spent a number of hours this past summer volunteering and shadowing.  I've spent time with children with special needs and many patients' families.  I have felt few things in life as rewarding as this interaction and in the bonds I have made with these people.  My brief contact with little Jordan, as well as others, has had a big influence in reminding me of my need for this human element.  My denial to medical school did temporarily lead me down a different career.  Yet, this career eventually brought me right back to medicine, with a clearer goal and a stronger passion and desire to achieve it.  In an attempt to gain acceptance into medical school, I will have continued my pursuit of knowledge in the classroom, distanced myself from the poor choices of my youth, and spent countless hours preparing in other ways, such as studying for the admissions test (for a second time, three years later).  In doing these things, I hope I have become a better and more focused applicant in my pursuit of a medical career that fits who I am and the person I want to become. Big Brother Although this has not officially started (I am in the process of being paired with a family), I have been accepted and have committed to one year as a Big Brother with the local Big Brothers/Big Sisters here in Cincinnati.  The commitment is at least twice a month for 4-6 hours.  I have wanted to participate with this program for some time now but I have never been in the proper position, whether it be financially or with the state of my residence, to feel as though I could properly volunteer for this service.  I am excited to finally be at that place and am very eager to get started and hopefully make a difference in the life of the young man I interact with.  I really enjoy being around children of all ages and I am excited for the fun and rewarding experience forthcoming., Research At Ball State I was involved in a few research projects.  Briefly, I worked to try and clone and sequence ancient mitochondrial DNA recovered from the dentin of skeletons of prehistoric Native Americans unearthed from Mounds State Park in Indiana.  The ultimate goal was to help determine how the Natives had migrated.  Upon conclusion, my project shifted  and focused on trying to understand and eliminate a multidrug resistant phenotype in a small cell lung cancer cell line.  I used RNAi technology to target specific RNA for degradation thus indirectly limiting protein production.  This later project eventually let to a change in my career path, from medicine to research.  It was new and fascinating and I enjoyed it so much that I decided to explore it more, enrolling at the University of Cincinnati in a molecular biology Ph.D. program.  However, while I do enjoy research and still like to hear about the advances and breakthroughs that come from it, because of other shortcomings I know now that it is not the career for me.  That being said, the hours I spent learning and participating in this field are invaluable and much of what I learned about molecular biology and physiology would provide a good foundation to continue to build upon in a career in medicine., Tutoring During my assistantship I was required to hold office hours for tutoring and other responsibilities, but I always tried to make myself available outside those times if students were having trouble with material in the class.  Although not a requirement, I felt it was part of my job to help my students when they needed it.  In addition, I have always had friends and/or roommates asking for help with homework, mainly in the fields of science and math, which I have always excelled in.   I always found it personally rewarding to help another in this way, which serves to lessen the frustration that can come with confusion.  In addition, teaching someone else tests your own knowledge of the subject, so tutoring was mutually beneficial., Outstanding Senior in Research and the Departmental Diploma During my senior year at Ball State I was nominated for two departmental awards including Outstanding Senior in Science and Outstanding Senior in Research.  Each award went to one senior in the biology department, and I received the later of the two.  I also received a departmental diploma, reserved for students that went the extra mile to complete the tasks outlined for the diploma as well as maintain a high academic standing.  My task was a creative project involving the research I did.  I was honored and humbled to be chosen for the award because I felt competition was strong.  I received special recognition at the graduation ceremony for receiving the departmental diploma, as did all those who received it.  Graduation was a great sense of accomplishment, and while these awards really added to that experience, I include them to show my dedication to the activities I get involved with, a dedication I would take with me into the medical field., Poster Presentation During one of my graduate level courses, we were required to complete and research project, as well as present a poster on that project at the end of the semester.  The poster presentation was nothing too extravagant but it still forced me to speak in front of an audience. It also forced me to communicate on multiple levels; one such that people outside of science could understand and another to prove to my professors that I knew what I was presenting.  This is a skill that can be directly applied to a physician's everyday life, when he or she must communicate on multiple levels depending on if the audience is a patient of colleague., Volunteering for the Local Church Growing up my mother coordinated a few things with the church that I routinely helped with.  The biggest events were the medical missions to a sister perish in Haiti, as well as a general fundraiser each year called the Festival of Trees and Lights.  Growing up our church was always a big part of my family and throughout middle school and high school I was usually involved with helping out in one place or another on a monthly basis.  This really helped me get more involved with the needs of others in my community and elsewhere., HGABEL Grant Recipient I authored two grant applications during my senior year at Ball State to help fund the research I was doing.  The Human Genetics and Bioethics Laboratory (HGABEL) grant was the one I received (in the amount of $500).  HGABEL money came internally and although Ball State has a good research base, it is not a heavily research oriented university.  So while $500 may not seem like much, it was the maximum amount paid out to an undergraduate applying for this grant.  While not only helping me to learn the scientific language used in grant applications, this experience also taught me that what I felt was a great idea and what others felt was an appropriate use of their money often differed.  I really had to take creative and original approaches to sell my ideas.  I believe innovative thinking is important because innovation lies at the heart advancement, which especially important in the field of medicine., Physician Shadowing I have shadowed physicians at many times in my career. However, never have I done so as extensively as I of late.  During the last three to four months, I have put in at least 50 hours of shadowing at the family practice clinic at Ball Memorial Hospital.  I chose family practice medicine because it covers such a wide range of disciplines and because it would also allow me to gain some experience in the discipline I currently lean towards, pediatrics.  During the last year or so, I have felt more and more compelled that medicine is my true calling.  My experiences while shadowing served to strengthen this appeal and solidify my desire of a career in medicine.  Now that I have spent these hours in the clinic, I understand the basics of what this career has to offer.  Thus, my choice to follow such a path is not void of the knowledge of where it would eventually take me., Tanning Consultant I included this experience because it is an example of one of the jobs I held while in college.  While at Ball State, I worked throughout the last two years of my undergraduate studies and as a graduate student.  Although the positions had little to do with the career I was pursuing, they taught me beneficial skills including time management, business management, responsibility, and how to prioritize.  It was tough to balance the course load associated with a premedical student/graduate student with working part time, but the stresses and hard work has paid dividends by shaping the discipline I have today., Graduate Assistant I received a graduate assistantship at Ball State University for the duration of my Masters degree.  Assistantships were not given to all graduate students accepted to the program and there was competition for the available spots.  This competition stemmed not only for the financial reasons, as it provided free tuition along with a small stipend for working while going to school, but also the work experience.  The work I did involved teaching the lab sections that went along with an introductory biology course as well as keeping the grades.  It actually proved to be both more enjoyable and more challenging that I had anticipated.  Trying to get younger students (typically non-science majors) interested in science was not an easy task.  Also, it again forced me to balance school and work.  I completed by Masters degree in one year, so the course load alone was broad and time consuming.  But I came away with a great experience.  It offered me my first chance to teach and assume the role of a mentor to my students who often came to me for help with classroom material.  Many of the younger students also had general questions about adjusting to college life so I was glad to share some of my experiences and advice.  In addition, this assistantship helped me develop my public speaking and leadership skills., Exercise/Conditioning I started taking my personal fitness much more seriously my sophomore year of college.  Since then I have always been a member at a local gym.  I usually try to get into the gym 4-5 days a week and I do a mix of both aerobic and anaerobic exercises.  Recently I have started running longer distances and hope to start entering some 5K and 10K exhibitions.  I include this not only because it is a big part of my life but also because I believe it has helped my personal and professional growth.  In learning about human physiology and psychology, it has become increasingly evident that being active goes hand in hand with overall health and longevity.  My routine over the years has also given me discipline and endurance (physical and mental), both of which I think will help me get through the rigors of medical school., Volunteering at a Summer Day Camp Stepping Stones is an organization to help serve children and adults with special needs.  They offer a summer camp each year where the campers, mostly children with a few young adults, enjoy activities such as arts and crafts, swimming, fishing, and games.  This summer I have been lucky enough to spend a few days as a volunteer at the camp.  Through this, I have been in contact some of the most creative and gifted children I have ever met.  They are such a joy to be around because, as a group, their attitudes are so much more positive that societies is on average.  I have been able play with, communicate with, and learn more than I ever thought possible from these very unique and bright individuals.  This experience has been one I have come to really covet and I think it has opened my eyes to a piece of society that I had not experienced much of prior to Stepping Stones.  I hope to be back at Stepping Stones more this summer and in summers to come., Intramural Sports Throughout my collegiate tenor I was usually involved in some type of intramural athletics.  Examples are flag football, basketball, and volleyball.  Typically, it has been no more than one per season.  Cincinnati Sports League is the organization that runs the intramural sports I have been a part of since moving to Cincinnati.  Athletics of some type has always been a big part of my life.  Although I have always had fun with these sports I also think they have helped build a competitive attitude and have offered an opportunity to develop my leadership and communication skills necessary in the workplace., Volunteering for the Local Habitat for Humanity Volunteering for Habitat for Humanity has been a great way for me to get involved with helping the local community.  It has also allowed me to meet and interact with a lot a amazing people at the job sites.  Although coming from a variety of vocations, everyone becomes a construction worker for the day.  The inexperience of so many presents fun and entertaining challenges as well as opportunities to become a leader of a specific task, however big or small.  One of my favorite things to do is talk with the future residents of the homes we build.  So many have touching stories to tell and they are so appreciative of the opportunity provided to them by Habitat.  Volunteering here has shown me the power of what people can do when they join together to try and defeat one of our countries biggest problems in impoverished housing and homelessness., Ball Memorial Hospital Emergency Room Volunteer Volunteering in the ER at the local hospital was a really great experience because it gave me a first hand look at a specific sector of the health care field and also allowed me to interact with the people being admitted.  My jobs were pretty basic but also important, including things such as cleaning the rooms after use, leading patients to their rooms, bringing the patients comforts such as blankets or drinks, as well as sitting and talking with the patients and their families.  I think the ER volunteers really helped make the visit to the ER less stressful to the patients while also giving them a chance to ask questions and relieve some of the anxiety associated with being there.  My time in the ER has also allowed me to see many of the common procedures and responsibilities of the physicians working there, thus, has also acted as an unorthodox form of shadowing."

    "text": "While driving home from a college visit looking for an undergraduate engineering program, I had some time to sit and talk with my friend and his father. The conversation shifted when my friend's father, a respected surgeon, began explaining to me the subtle intricacies of his profession; his successes, challenges, failures, and relationships. Being a doctor to him meant having a passionate thirst for solving problems and an eager and enthusiastic approach in taking on new challenges. The hours passed when he finally turned the question back to me, Jeff, with your curiosity and natural ability at problem solving, why not pursue a career in medicine  The question spawned a realization; the traits and capabilities that had made him a successful doctor were all attributes that people have used to describe me.  I know I have always possessed an exceptionally high sense of curiosity compared to my friends. As a young boy, if I broke a toy, I was quick to take it apart to find out what went wrong and how I could fix it. I recall during my eighth grade graduation ceremony being named most inquisitive amongst students. It was not the 'future NFL star' award I had wanted at the time, but in hindsight, the award could not have been more fitting. Later on as an engineering student, I enjoyed being challenged with a broad scope of physics, chemistry, and biology that helped me become familiar and competent in the Biomedical Engineering field. Although I may now be older, I still possess the same passion and drive when seeking out new challenges, experiences, and knowledge.  After Co-Oping with a medical device company, Atircure, Inc., through my undergraduate experience, my superiors recognized my hunger to learn and natural curiosity. I was constantly inquiring about our different clinical applications and new concepts. My enthusiasm paid off after graduation when a Vice President of the company contacted me about his new department managing the innovation of new surgical concepts. He knew I had a passion for understanding and immediately recruited me as an engineer on his team. I accepted the position knowing I would be free to explore all avenues of our technologies and treatments while also using that knowledge to create new clinical solutions. In this relatively small department, I work alongside innovative engineers to create new options for cardiothoracic surgeons and electrophysiologists. Every day I explore different scientific technologies that may be applied to new surgical methods, devices.  Not only has this experience illustrated my constant drive for knowledge and understanding, but it has served as a vehicle to move my natural passion and curiosity into the medical field. Every week I work in operating rooms, labs or workshops side by side with surgeons and hospital staff to investigate solutions to life threatening issues. Much like a young boy working to fix broken toys, I have realized that I want to one day work on diagnosing and curing patients.  Equipped with this self realization, I know that I want to attend medical school. When explaining this decision to others, I am often warned of the challenges that lay ahead. However, these people were always quick to acknowledge my ability to seek and tackle new challenges.  During my junior year in college I began looking for some new challenges in addition to my coursework.  I decided that I needed some kind of completely new challenge. A recruitment flyer for the men's rowing team caught my eye one day at lunch. I was sold. The sport offered a new form of challenge that I had not experienced.  Rowing tested my disciplines physically and mentally. I had to maintain a healthy lifestyle, from the food I ate to the hours I slept.  I learned to work my body well beyond its familiar limits. However courageous the physical disciplines may have been, the most demanding aspect of rowing was psychologically disciplining myself. No matter how early in the morning or exhausting a workout was, I learned to focus my work with a goal in mind. All sacrifice had a purpose, whether it was achieving a new personal record time or working for future success with teammates. Eventually, everything about the sport had to be taken with this attitude. I had to I wake up at 4:30 AM for practice nearly every day for what extended to be a nine month season. When some called me crazy for sticking with it, the successes of an individual indoor championship in the winter and a national championship invitation in the spring made the sacrifices and disciplining worthwhile.  I believe my zealous attitude in welcoming challenges suits me well toward the medical profession.  Not only will the disciplines I learned through rowing carry me through the difficult times in medical school and residency, but in welcoming new problems and situations as a committed and passionate physician. Much like I experienced, solutions and successes are not always immediately evident. Physicians need persistence in working toward their ultimate goal.  I believe that my ambition for problem solving and understanding in medicine led to my realization that I wanted to become a doctor. Further, my enthusiasm toward new challenges and goals will make me an outstanding physician. Biomedical Research Co-op As a research Co-Op, I worked under Dr. Balakrishna Haridas and Dr. Todd Abruzzo investigating the biomechanical properties of intracranial aneurysms.  My responsibilities were mainly to design, purchase, and build a flow model of the cerebral vascular system.  I used patient data (CT) to construct  3D models of the vascular geometry, and then refined these models with CAD software (SolidWorks).  Eventually I built a finite element model (ABAQUS) of a saccular intracranial aneurysm for mechanical simulation and failure modes.  I also worked briefly with Dr. Haridas on his PelvicSim project.  This was a joint project through UCBME and Proctor& Gamble's FemCare Division.  For this project, I researched and compiled relevant literature concerning the open research areas.  I then authored several sections of an R01 grant application to fund future research., Biomedical Engineering Society As a society member I attended monthly meetings at the University of Cincinnati chapter.  I actively assisted the society with welcoming freshman into the program and overseeing program exhibits.  I attended the BMES national conference in Chicago this fall., UC Men's Rowing Secretary and Recruitment Head During my second season and a member of the varsity boat of the UC Men's Rowing Team, I was elected to an officer status on the team.  As Secretary and Head of Recruitment, I was put in charge of the team's organizational recruitment of new rowers over the summer and fall of 2006.  As Head of Recruitment, I was in charge of attracting, contacting, and facilitating new rowers for our program.  I ran weekly exhibits over the summer advertising our program.  Once a potential recruit expressed interest in our program I formatted a database of recruits and continually contacted them all over the summer and eventually held informational meetings once school began.  With the recruits now finalized on the team, I attend the daily novice practices as an assistant to the coach and team advisor.  As the team secretary, my responsibilities are focused on business matter.  I work in hand with the team treasurer and coach to finalize travel plans, make financial arrangements, author contracts, and make team decisions., La Clinica Latino Community Health Center During the 2003-2004 school year at Saint Louis University I volunteered weekly at a local clinic for hispanic families known as La Clinica.  I mainly was involved in working with the children whose families came to the clinic.  This typically involved three to four hours of nvolvement with an inner city-youth who spoke English as a second language.  The program worked on a three shift basis.  The first hour of tutoring was strictly done in Spanish with an individual student.  After a short break, I helped the students with their classwork while speaking only English.  The final session of the day would then involve the helping the children with arts, crafts, or some physical activity., Biomedical Engineer I am currently an employee of Atricure under the title Associate Biomedical Engineer. I work in the New Developments and Research department innovating new concepts and ideas to be further developed and validated.  Atricure develops medical devices to surgically treat cardiac arrhythmias and work toward stroke prevention. My role in this process is to take input from surgeons and medical staff and find technology that best meets their needs. I have scaled the clinical landscape, developed testing procedures, and overseen the development of the concepts as they move forward into the verification phases. This has included working side by side with surgeons in operating rooms regularly. After developing concepts and ideas, I then put them to test in animal and cadaver studies. My work also includes clinical consultations at numerous hospitals and business negotiations across the country.  Specifically, I have worked on a cryoablation probe to isolate the pulmonary veins during the Cox-Maze procedure to treat Atrial Fibrillation.  More recently I have worked to develop an isolation clip to occlude the Left Atrial Appendage as a preventative measure against stroke. I headed a large scale chronic study at the Cleveland Clinic to evaluate the clip's effectiveness after 30 and 90 day post-implant durations., Lloyd J. Banks Scholarship for Excellence I earned a $5000 scholarship entering college for my achievements in leadership and community service through high school.  The award was sponsored by the Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield Company., UC Men's Rowing Team Member I entered the program during my second year at the University of Cincinnati.  I started off as a novice team member, and moved in to the Varsity A boat during my second year.    Despite the team's club status, we are considered a varsity intercollegiate sport.  We travel all over the country to compete with the nation's top programs.  This past spring we experienced success at the IRA National Championships in New Jersey.  Individually, I won the top honor at the Regional Indoor Championships during the winter of 2006.  The program requires a great amount of time commitment, dedication, and work ethic.  Typically daily practices run three hours.  During the fall and spring competition seasons, we travel roughly five weekends per season for competition.  With six practices a week, fund raising, travel, and competition, the sport has taught me a great deal about focus and time-management., Knothole Baseball Coach I volunteered my time during the spring and summer seasons of 2005 to work with a 10 and 11 year old boy's baseball team.  Our team was affiliated with a local parish, Our Lady of Visitation.  As coach, I was responsible for 3 weekly practices and roughly 20 games over the season.  I shared the coaching responsibilities with a fellow classmate., 2007 BioOhio Annual Conference I was a presenter and speaker in the 2007 BioOhio Annual Conference.  Alongside my former professor from the University of Cincinnati, I represented both my University and my current employer, Atricure, Inc.  in the speaker presentation entitled Grooming Tomorrow's Innovators., Product Vendor I work for Aramark Vending during the fall seasons for Cincinnati Bengals football events.  Consistently I earned top privileges and placements based on my top sales numbers and work ethic., Atricure Biomedical Engineering Co-op I worked primarily on Atricure's emerging technology regarding their dual electrode bipolar clamps for RF ablations during cardiothoracic surgery.  I worked through the product development cycle on the ASB3 switchbox matrix which incorporated pacing and stimulation technology with their regular ablation devices, as well as implemented new dual clamps.  I developed protocols, built fixtures and prototypes, and tested procedures.  I took part in regular animal labs at the UC Center for Surgical Innovation testing our newly developed prototypes.  I also logged many hours in researching failure modes using bovine heart tissue for bench testing., Community Action Program Through my freshman year at Saint Louis University, I volunteered in every Saturday morning for 4 hours working with an inner city parish youth center.  Our activities included sporting events, crafts, community cleanup, and tutoring with the parish children."

    "text": "Repeat after me: oh-bee-si-tee. I exaggerate every syllable, pointing at a picture of a boy with excess body fat gorging on fries and a milkshake. Does anyone know what obesity means I ask. In response, a 7 year old girl, at 122 pounds and just over three feet tall, quietly shakes her head. Her mother works at a fast food restaurant and feeds her daughter their breakfast items every morning. She is one of the many children I serve as an AmeriCorps member of Children's Hunger Alliance. My main role in this nonprofit agency is to educate children in urban low-income communities throughout Cincinnati, Ohio, about nutrition as a long-term solution for both childhood hunger and obesity. I had two main motivations for committing a year of service to AmeriCorps. First, as an aspiring physician, I hoped to understand and address the obesity crisis in Cincinnati. Second, I hoped to explore my first inspiration towards pursuing medicine, which stemmed from Dr. Samuel Yoo, a Korean medical missionary living in Uganda.    I met Dr. Yoo in my junior year of high school when I was questioning the purpose of life. During his presentation at my church, Dr. Yoo described many hardships and frustrations he had regarding the desperate medical needs of Ugandans. I experienced a moment of revelation when he said, There were times when I could do nothing for my AIDS patients though they were dying in front of me because there was no medicine in the hospital. But when I saw how the patients were healed from their fatal diseases, I could feel my life was worthwhile. At that moment, I saw an ordinary person with a profession that allows him to connect to other human beings beyond racial, cultural and socio-economic barriers; I discovered that this profession is fundamentally committed to using the specialized knowledge and skills for the benefit of others. Through his example, I saw the life worth living and the path worth following.  In order to gain insight into the foundation of medicine shown by Dr. Yoo, I have immersed myself in the very at-risk community in Cincinnati. Living on a poverty-level stipend without a personal vehicle has allowed me to witness the complex etiology of childhood obesity. People of low incomes here are disproportionately affected by the burden of obesity and the associated risks for chronic illnesses. Many experience social and environmental barriers to a healthy lifestyle, such as limited access to full-service grocery stores and high accessibility of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods at a very low cost. Many children lack the opportunity to share meals prepared at home or to develop healthy habits related to diet and fitness. As a woman living in an image-conscious society, I can also relate to the devastating socio-psychological effects of obesity on children, such as discrimination and low self-esteem. Understanding of these issues has given me passion to deliver early nutrition education as a prevention strategy for at-risk children.  So how should I guide these children For me, the answer has not been as simple as low-fat and healthy whole grains. One lesson I learned from my undergraduate research experience was to never take anyone's word for anything. My research advisor always urged me to read primary research articles critically in order to challenge established beliefs, including my own. During my research into the underlying mechanisms of obesogenesis, I have observed how the physicians' perspective on biomedical research is inspired by their direct interaction with patients. Thus, physicians play a central role in bridging the gap between bench and bedside by turning lab results into clinical reality. This literature research has revealed to me that obesity is not only an individual health issue, but a societal and public health crisis. This understanding led me to discover the physicians' role in caring for individual patients at the collective level as public health professionals in order to address chronic illnesses within the larger social, economic and cultural context.  Physicians uniquely bridge the domains of individual health and public health, thus are in the best position to empower the general public through education and advocacy, and shape public health policy regarding social and environmental determinants of health.  Currently, I am striving to promote health among the children I serve. My program incorporates novel research-based nutrition and intervention strategies. As a result, the children have started eating more fruits and vegetables and making healthier choices. However, my short term nutrition class will only yield limited success unless it involves both individual and society changes along with advances in obesity research. As a physician, I will be in the best position to gain new insight into diseases through research, and to create a more integrated community-based prevention program that will have a more lasting, powerful impact on the sick. Through medicine, I will have the opportunity to merge my passions for research, service and public health into a beautiful art that is wrapped in science. In this vision, I can see the purpose and joy of my life, and am committed to making this vision a reality. 2011 Annual Meeting - American Society for Cell Biology Abstract Publications: 1) 2011 Annual Meeting - American Society for Cell Biology  Pamula, M, Hong, Y, Barua, B, Desai, B, Trent, R, Walworth, N, Hitchcock-DeGregori, S (2011).

    "text": "Running frantically to return a drop shot in the final moments of a hard-fought squash match, I felt an unexpected searing pain in my right knee. Only two weeks after my victory at the Midwestern Open Under 17 bracket, I suffered a severe cartilage tear. It seemed impossible! After four years of hard work, training, and constant physical strain, I had finally won my first tournament. With this win, my appetite was whetted and I trained even more vigorously. Thus, despite the serious nature of my injury, I initially dismissed its significance since surgery was not required. After challenging the doctor's orders not to play squash (due to my youthful sense of invincibility), I finally succumbed because of the likelihood of permanent damage. Before the injury, my plan was to receive a collegiate squash scholarship. Unfortunately, my plans went awry and instead of endurance training for squash, I went to therapy for six months. As I journeyed through my first real exposure to the healthcare system, I was amazed at the correlation between the medical profession and my personality.  Due to this injury, I saw the vitality of the profession, and I was inspired to further my goals within the medical field. After my recovery, I began volunteering at Miami Valley Hospital. As a volunteer, I was able to serve patients by bringing them water and delivering flowers. Consequently, I had an insider's view of patients in often-painful conditions. I began to feel what it would be like to assist patients beyond flowers and water, where I could really pay it forward by helping others in the way that I had been helped during my knee injury. Interacting with patients allowed me to see the balance between hope and reality, concern and professionalism, and most of all, compassion and detachment. Due to what I had witnessed, I chose to be a biology and pre-medicine major at the University of Cincinnati.  Throughout college, I continued to volunteer and engage in other activities that enhanced my passion for medicine. I worked as a patient transporter and personal care assistant in the emergency and operating rooms at Miami Valley Hospital. After hearing patients discuss the impact of healthcare, I was determined to not only be a physician, but a compassionate partner in their health care. Through this job, I was able to converse with individuals who had neurological disorders. Interacting with them allowed me to see that medicine is not just improving the physical conditions of the patients, but improving their mental stability and ensuring their sense of well-being.  As I invested more time making contributions at the hospital, I was eager to see medicine through the eyes of a physician. I shadowed an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. John Gallagher, during surgery, office visits, and rehabilitation. Whether it was hearing the doctor drilling through a bone or repairing a rotator cuff, I became even more excited as I was able to connect the knowledge from courses such as Anatomy and Physiology to a real-life setting. Over the course of three months, I experienced the satisfaction of seeing the progress patients made, from barely walking to moving with relative ease. One of the most memorable patients was an elderly woman, who had severe colon cancer but came to orthopedics because of knee pain. As she recounted her feelings of the end being near, I saw the doctor temporarily relieve her pain by listening to her. This interaction highlighted the value of sincerity in providing comfort.  My knowledge expanded as I took more science courses like Biochemistry and Biology of Cancer. In addition to applying this knowledge, I wanted to have a better understanding of how science developed. Thus, I delved into applied research. At Meridian Bioscience Inc., I designed polyclonal ELISAs to diagnose the presence of Salmonella. To continue my research in pertinent diseases, I worked on a project at Cincinnati Children's Hospital to reduce the size of tumors in colon cancer utilizing genetics. Transitioning from being a patient, to providing aid to patients, and finally to performing research, I was able to experience medicine through different lenses. From my experiences, I have also realized in order to meet the needs of my patients and employees, I will also need to appreciate the business side of private practice. I believe running a successful medical practice in today's climate requires both strong leadership and business skills. Through my involvement in university activities, I have developed my leadership skills, and I am currently working to develop my business skills, through my pursuit of an MBA.  I fully comprehend that thus far, I have seen just the tip of the iceberg in the medical field. For me, medicine presents itself as the ideal avenue to channel my skills as a leader, my passion in the sciences, and my commitment to helping others in critical moments. Through the knowledge and wisdom gained in medical school, I hope that one day I can help improve the quality of life for my patients and touch their lives in a meaningful way. Perhaps I can even encourage others, as I have been encouraged, to enter into the medical field. No one is an island. All human beings deserve the right to have compassionate healthcare providers. Supplemental Instructor at the Learning Assistance Center As a supplemental instructor for sophomore biology courses -- Genetics and Cell Biology -- I helped the students by reviewing the dense course material discussed in class in an interactive fashion via group discussions and fun activities to aid in their comprehension. Through my efforts, the third of class who attended improved by nearly one letter grade., ROAR Student Ambassador, VP of Recruitment, President As a volunteer, I represented the university at student and alumni gatherings and provided campus tours and admissions advice to prospective students. As the Vice President for recruitment, I brought the largest group of tour guides in the history of the organization by embracing diversity and making a more stringent and fair admission process. Finally, as President I led an organizational rebranding effort, by committing to develop the leadership capabilities of the members via a leadership experience for course credit in conjunction with the University Honors Program, leadership retreats, guest speakers, and developing an organizational mentoring program. My work in the organization has been recognized in various university publications., Featured Student in University Literature I have been recognized for my leadership ability, service aspirations, and academic prowess in various publications for the local community. Listed below are some of the publications I have been recognized in:  - University of Cincinnati Pre-professional advising student brochure, 2010, recognized for being an exemplary pre-medical student,  - University of Cincinnati Activus, 2009, selected by student government for leadership qualities and outstanding campus involvement, - University of Cincinnati Undergraduate Admissions Viewbook, 2009, selected by President Nancy Zimpher to represent the university to prospective students considering the university. It is viewed by thousands of prospective students and their families worldwide., University Wide Recognitions and Scholarships I have received the Mary Jane Miller Toepfer Memorial Scholarship, Darwin T. Turner Scholarship, and Cincinnatus Scholarship for academic excellence during my time at UC. I have also been inducted into the Mortar Board, Golden Key International Honour Society, National Society of Collegiate Scholars, and Alpha Lambda Delta. I am also part of the University Honors  Program and have made Deans List every quarter in college., McMicken Ambassadors Founding member and Vice President I represented the McMicken College of Arts and Sciences at university-wide events and assisted in the attraction and retention of students, created a McMicken blog and Facebook page to help increase college unity and attract prospective students, and assisted with the planning and execution of Welcome Day for over 1000 freshmen. My lasting impact involved working to increase the communication among the college's various departments to present a unified information session as well as involve current students in the presentation to prospective students., Shadowing an Orthopedic Surgeon I shadowed Dr. John Gallagher, an extremely well known orthopedic surgeon in the Cincinnati area. I watched surgeries and office visits to better understand the art of medicine. I was able to observe a wide spectrum of orthopedic procedures, ranging from complete knee replacements to basic procedures such as discussing a minor injury with a patient., Personal Care Assistant at The Miami Valley Hospital I worked in the medical imaging department, surgery, operating room, and emergency room, moving patients from one area to another to receive the necessary specialized care. I often discussed their care with them and ensured that they were staying in good spirits. I also received training in CPR, maintaining safety of patients, and reducing spread of infectious diseases within The Miami Valley Hospital., Cincinnati Childrens Medical Center Colon Cancer Research I worked on determining the synergistic influence between SPEDF, GFI1, and ATOH1 in tumor reduction in colon cancer. I investigated whether a concurrent sequence in the promoter of the gene can be found to increase SPEDF's effectiveness. If the synergy between ATOH1, GF1, and SPEDF can be directly correlated to the decrease in size or number of tumors, then it would be a valuable discovery. I investigated the interaction among the three genes using bacterial transformations and detection via a luciferase gene. The experience concluded with the creation of a poster and presentation at a UC Research Symposium., Student Developmental Council and UC Telefund Office In these various capacities, I was a student leader for fundraising in the Proudly Cincinnati campaign, which aimed to raise $1 billion to improve student life. I was a founding member and eventual vice president of the Student Developmental Council. In this organization, I spearheaded an effort to add a bike path and a method for students to rent bikes for free to ride around campus. Lastly, as an employee at the University of Cincinnati Telefund office, which requests donations from alums, I was recognized as an outstanding fundraiser numerous times., Research Associate at Meridian Bioscience Inc. Initially, I assisted in the creation of a polyclonal ELISA test kit for the diagnosis of Salmonella, Shigella, and Flexneri. These food born pathogens affect millions of people worldwide, which made work in this field especially important. The second part involved attempting to expand the STAT-EHEC platform, which currently tests for E-coli in a human being in 20 minutes, to test for Salmonella or Shigella as well. The final part of my internship included the development of a database and sorting method to organize test samples, which is still used today, nearly two years later., Volunteer Scholar at The Miami Valley Hospital Over the past seven years, I have volunteered hundreds of hours at The Miami Valley Hospital. My duties included assisting with patients in check in for surgery, delivering flowers, and serving food or water to patients. I had countless opportunities to interact with patients, hospital staff, and doctors. I have also learned a lot about the behind scenes activities that go into creating the ideal environment for a physician to function. Based on my service, I also received a collegiate scholarship., USA President's Volunteer Service Award Bronze Level Receiving this award entailed completing over 150 hours of community service in a single calendar year and meeting various other criteria. I performed service for many organizations, including The Miami Valley Hospital, First Lego, and Wizards of Wright. As a part of both First Lego and Wizards of Wright, I demonstrated scientific principles associated with aviation to underprivileged inner-city children using experimentation such as rockets and paper airplanes. In addition, I volunteered in events that directly helped my local community like Day of Caring, which helped replenish food at the food banks. I also helped with the Beerman Family Thanksgiving Day Dinner, which provided dinner for individuals who didn't have the means to celebrate Thanksgiving Day. Through this award, my efforts were recognized by then President George W. Bush.,  Research Associate,  Supplemental Instructor"

    "text": "The desire to practice medicine was born during my high school years in the Philippines. I was visiting the cadaver lab at one of Manila's top medical schools with my Anatomy class. The open windows, high humidity, and ninety-five degree heat of the tropics, coupled with bodies that were only preserved with massive doses of formaldehyde, created quite a smell. Nonetheless, I meandered through the room totally fascinated. Although stiff remains of their once living forms, the cadavers were far more intriguing than textbooks, and I knew this was what I wanted to study.  I was, and still am, attracted to the field of medicine for three reasons. First is the amazement I have for the human body. Nothing I've come across equals its ability to inspire awe. Secondly, I enjoy challenges. The most rewarding part of my current job is that I am constantly stretched in new ways to motivate and train interns. Finally, I want to be a doctor because of the unique capacity it offers to do good.  I want to look back on my life when I retire, and know that the world is a little better because of the contribution I made in my career.  While I have always wanted to pursue a career in medicine, my route has been non-traditional to say the least. I began working with the Southwestern Company after my freshman year at Wheaton College, not only as a means of paying for college, but because I wanted to hone my communication skills and work ethic. I knew these would strengthen my ability to relate to people from all different backgrounds. I continued with Southwestern for all four summers during college because I was constantly challenged.  The job entails running one's own business, selling educational books to families door-to-door. I learned the value of perseverance, even on days when I worked fourteen hours and earned nothing. And I learned to not get too excited when it seemed like everything was going perfectly.  At the end of four years, I had successfully graduated from college debt free, with tenacity and skills far beyond what I would have learned elsewhere. I was on a high from success with the company and decided to put medical school on hold for another year. At the same time, I had just married my wife Emily, who was on her way to medical school herself. Instead of getting in debt way over our heads, I felt it was wisest to continue my work mentoring students at Southwestern, while she finished her studies. I enjoyed teaching students business acumen, communication skills and principles of personal and organizational management.  It was gratifying to see  them grow and excel. I also enjoyed the success I was having with the company -- the affirmation from others, the free time to pursue other interests like reading, golf, camping, and the opportunity to travel to different parts of the world. During this time I maintained my desire to contribute to countries in need.  For the past two years, for example, I coordinated a service project during a company sponsored trip to the Caribbean. Over 150 students from the company chose to participate each time. But while I have enjoyed and benefited greatly from my years at Southwestern, I have never lost my first love, medicine. The part of the my job that I have found the most rewarding is training and coaching students. This experience has helped me refine my objectives in the field of medicine.  My goal is not only to be a doctor, but to be a teacher of physicians. As I've witnessed in the Philippines and in other countries I have visited, there are many people willing to learn -- just not enough adequate programs and personnel to teach them. The solution of sending more doctors from America, while commendable, is only a short-term solution.  I would like to be a part of a more far-reaching solution, such as establishing a medical school in another country. The need is tremendous, and although I am only one person, I believe that through a life of dedication, I can make a difference. Two years ago I was very encouraged to be accepted at a medical school but, unfortunately, my wife matched in a different city than where I was accepted. Instead of spending the next four years apart, which would not have contributed to a healthy marriage, I am reapplying this year. I have used and will continue to use the interim to further strengthen myself in preparation for medical school. In April 2008 I shadowed Dr. Timothy Pritts, a trauma surgeon, while he was on call and witnessed some incredible procedures.  I then worked with Dr. Jeffrey Schlaudecker, a Family Medicine doctor at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati. This past year I enrolled in the second quarter of Biochemistry 602, without ever having taken Biochemistry before, and earned an A. I feel my knowledge is still as sharp as it was after college, especially given the evidence of my increased MCAT score. I am ready and excited about medical school--the joys and challenges it will bring. It has been almost ten years since that day in the cadaver lab in Manila.  Along the way my path has taken me on a variety of unconventional routes as a philosophy major, a college student selling books door-to-door, and now as a mentor to college students.  Looking back, I would not have had it any other way. Lab TA for general chemistry As a lab/teaching assistant for a general chemistry class I had a variety of responsibilities.  I set up the labs, and mingled to answer questions that arose during the lab session.  I graded all the lab reports and tests.  Outside of the responsibilities of the lab itself, I conducted a complete inventory of the Wheaton College Chemistry department stockroom. Although tedious, I learned a great deal. I was also available outside of lab sessions for tutoring.  Students sought me ought for tutoring because I could simplify the complicated aspects of Chemistry., Organization Leader As an organization leader I was responsible for not only selling the books full-time and managing my personal team of on average five members, but also for managing an additional 5 to 10 experienced students and their teams.  Typically this meant 30 to 40 people.  It was a massive responsibility.  My first time, at the age of 20, our group produced over $600,000 in sales during the three months of the summer.  The next two years we beat that!  I was in charge of keeping students accountable to their work through a nightly phone tree. We had weekly meetings on Sundays which I planned and ran. These meetings were typically 3-4 hours of additional training and motivation. I always tried to plan a fun activity we could all do in the afternoon on Sunday.  By the time I added the hours I spent leading and managing the organization to my other responsibilities of my personal sales and my personal team management, I was working wellover 100 hours a week.  I learned that it is only possible to manage statistics and details, never people.  People must be led.  Overall this job was the most challenging thing I have ever done, and the most rewarding., Summer Sales Internship Each of my summers in college I participated in a summer sales internship with the Southwestern Company.  I relocated to a different state each summer (Oklahoma, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Massachusetts), selling educational books to families in their homes.  It was extremely challenging because of the rejection, the long hours (over 80 hours each week), and the responsibility of managing a personal business.  My first summer I finished in the top 5% of 2000 first year students.  Each summer after that I was ranked in the top 3% of all 3400 students that work in the program.  Before doing this I had never taken a business class, or really had any business experience.  Not only did I learn a great deal about running a business (in my four summers as a student I sold over $250,000 worth of books), but more importantly, I learned to work hard, set goals, and consistently reach those goals.  Additionally, my parents were not able to help me pay for school and Wheaton College was expensive.  Because of my job with Southwestern, I was able to graduate without ever taking a loan!  My main reason for doing this internship was to distinguish myself from other medical school applicants by proving my independence, persistence in the face of challenges, and ability to work long hours under pressure., International Service Projects For the past 3 years I have organized and led a service project for 150 college students. Students who work in the Southwestern Company that perform better than average earn a reward trip. I had the idea to organize a day of service that would be voluntary for the students on the trip. This meant giving up one day of their 5 day vacation to volunteer helping others. I contacted an agency to help with the logistics of finding an area where we would make an impact. I promoted the importance of giving back to the local community to our students. The first year in Jamaica we helped to paint a school and did some construction. The people in the community said it was the first time they had ever seen tourists help the local people. The next year we went to la Ciudad de la Alegria, or City of Joy, in Cancun. This is a comprehensive community outreach center containing everything from a leprosarium to a legal advice office. The place was incredible. We held babies at the orphanage, visited with the residents of the nursing home, helped the staff organize donated food and clothes, and whitewashed the entire parking lot and road around the complex. I wanted to make a real difference for people in these countries. It is a testimony to the character of the students we work with that so many volunteered their time., Marriage to University of Cincinnati Medical student I consider it a tremendous advantage to have a wife that I watched go through Medical School and now start her residency this last year.  I saw the ups and downs.  I am intimately familiar with the many hours of studying, the grueling exams, the structure of the four years, the process of applying to residencies, and the matching system.  Apart from actually experiencing it all first hand, I have had the next best thing.    Altogether I feel more confident that I can succeed in Medical School, and I anticipate the experience even more. I cannot imagine preparation for the challenge., Internship with Dermatologists and Otolaryngologists I invested Spring Break of my sophomore year shadowing a team of dermatologists and otolaryngologists.  I observed them in both surgical and clinical settings.  Each allowed me to participate in basic exams, and was gracious enough to teach me as they worked.  The head of the dermatologist team was a leader in a new technique for skin cancer removal called the MOHS technique.  It allowed for a much less invasive procedure through constant evaluation of small tissue samples being removed.  Furthermore, because of the immediate feedback from the lab, he could have confidence that the entire cancer had been removed. This experience was a great confirmation that I did not just enjoy studying the human body. I found the daily practice of medicine fascinating as well., Trauma Call I recently had the privilege of shadowing Dr. Timothy Pritts, a trauma surgeon, while he was on call. I was able to watch a range of procedures from caring for gunshot wounds, to motorcycle accident victims, to a laproscopic appendectomy. One procedure in particular, a hemicolectomy was incredible. As the resident was opening up the abdomen, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 30/18. Immediately he incised from below the navel up to the chest and thrust his arm up to the aorta. There he clamped down on the descending aorta until the blood pressure stabilized 10 minutes later. It was intense. He then removed the entirety of the transverse colon because it was perforated in multiple places. Dr. Pritts periodically explained the next step in the procedure, and showed me how specific instruments worked. My favorite instrument was the intestinal stapler. Overall I enjoyed watching Dr. Pritts interact with patients. He had a calming effect with them and their families. He always took plenty of time to answer all questions in a manner they could understand. Dr. Pritts is a great role model., Volunteer at Crossroads Health Clinic I volunteer at the Crossroads Health Clinic in Cincinnati, Ohio.  It is in an under-served part of the city.  Their patient population is comprised largely of people with no insurance.    I have assisted them with bringing patients back to their rooms where I can get basic physical information from them.  I also assist with the children where necessary for some procedures, predominantly vaccinations.  My final responsibility has been helping with entering patient information to their database system after appointments.    Overall this experience has kept me involved firsthand in the medical environment., Shadowed Chair of Neurosurgery at Yale University Immediately after my freshman year at Wheaton College I was given the privilege of shadowing the Chair of Neurosurgery at Yale University.  Most of the day was spent in an eight hour surgery, removing a cancer from the left hemisphere's motor cortex.  Before doing this I anticipated enjoying surgery, and this was total confirmation of that interest.  I literally stood at his elbow the entire eight hours of the operation.  I could not have had a better view.  Dr. Spencer was kind enough to explain as he operated, so I could follow, albeit on a basic level.  I love the intensity of surgery, and the possibility of providing an immediate solution to a major problem., Student Manager In addition to the task of selling the educational books 80 hours a week each summer, I was responsible for recruiting, training, and leading teams of other students.  Each year there are over 500 teams in the company and we always finished in the top 5%.  Before the summer I was involved in interviewing students.  Because the job of going door to door is so challenging, and we work such long hours, most people are not interested.  I learned how to talk to people about the importance of getting out of their comfort zone and working harder than they ever had before. During the summer I spent at least ten hours a week coaching them over the phone. Every night I talked to each one so I could hear how their day went, offer advice on technical matters, and provide emotional support. Many times I had them follow me for a day as I worked so they could just watch me handle different situations. Through this I learned that leadership is not about what you say, it is about what you do. A great leader must lead by example., Shadowing Family Practice Doctors at Christ Hospital In December 2008 I worked with some of Christ Hospital's Family Practice residency attendings for two weeks.  Predominantly I worked with Dr. Jeff Schlaudecker, who specializes in Geriatrics.    Each day began with rounding with the residents.  Their philosophy is family-centered rounding, which allows the doctors to round and present the details of a given patient's condition with the family present.  The process ensures clear communication among the residents, but also with the patient and the family members.  Of course, certain situations necessitated meeting without the patient or family.  After rounds, Dr. Schlaudecker would take time to visit a little more with certain patients to clarify the course of action, or glean further information from test results.  Then I attended the residency's daily teaching session over lunch.  Topics ranged from unique diseases, to the special care required for patients with diabetes.    Finally, Dr. Schlaudecker and I share a passion for international medicine.  I enjoyed hearing his many stories of what he was doing overseas., Living Overseas My family moved to the Philippines when I was just two years old.  We lived there with the exceptions of a couple of summers, and my ninth grade.  For the first three years we lived on one of the southern islands, Mindanao.  Throughout the rest of our time there we lived in Manila, the capitol.  So while I am an American citizen, I am more truly a citizen of the world.  I went to an international school where I had friends from over 40 countries.  Our house was in an all Filipino neighborhood, so I was further immersed in the Philippine culture.  As we continue to live in a more interconnected world, the experiences I had growing up overseas are more and more valuable.  I learned how to relate to people from all different backgrounds, not on my terms, but on theirs and I feel comfortable in just about any cultural situation.    It was in the Philippines that my passion for international medicine began.  One of my favorite books growing up was Where There Is No Doctor, essentially a quick reference medical book that covered everything from tropical diseases, to wound care, and even childbirth.  I read it more times than I can count.  In fact, on a trip to Mexico a few years ago, a friend of mine dislocated her shoulder.  I used the technique I learned in that book to put her arm back in place., Lab TA for general biology My work as a Biology lab/teacher's assistant involved planning the lab sessions, and then preparing all the supplies necessary. Many times I was in charge of teaching about the subject that was to be studied. I also graded all the lab reports and tests. I made it a goal to create a fun learning environment, so I was the lone lab assistant to play music during the lab time. My favorite setup was the fetal pig dissection series. I took special pride in a meticulously dissected model for the students to reference. I believe that working hard and having fun are not mutually exclusive. The reviews I received afterwards from the students were highly positive., District Sales Manager Since graduating from Wheaton I have worked with the Southwestern Company for one year as an Associate Sales Leader, and since then as a District Sales Manager.  I intentionally wanted to postpone medical school to allow me to develop more leadership and training capabilities.  My life goal is to be a teacher of physicians. My job entails working with students from 14 different universities, about 100 students altogether.  I recruit, interview, and train them before the summer begins.  During the summer I travel to where they are working to further coach and encourage them in what they are doing.  Most are like I was, with no business or sales experience before coming to us. In addition to learning how to train students, the constant academic environment has kept me fresh (students can earn 3 college credits in either Marketing or Communications because of the training they receive in our program). I know I will be ready to switch sides and become a student again., Global Missions Health Conference The Global Health Missions Conference is an annual event addressing the pressing issues in global health care with an emphasis on missions.  The conference is held in Louisville, Kentucky, each year. Topics range from applying to medical schools, to organizations supporting medical missions, to testimonies about work being done.  There is even a group called Project MedSend that helps physicians make payments on their loans while serving overseas.  My favorite part was the keynote speaker who was practicing in rural Africa.  He was a physician and veterinarian, so he was able to help the people with their own health care needs, and the needs of their livestock.  I continue to be inspired by all the stories.  Each year my wife and I try to attend."

    "text": "The patient, a two-year-old female named Lola, at first appeared perfectly healthy. Aside from her skittish and passive behavior, Lola looked and acted very much like her peers. She socialized and interacted in characteristic ways, hiding and playing for most of the day. Only after dinner one day did I notice that she, while appearing to act normally, was actually not eating. Her food would remain untouched, only to be eaten by her hungry friends. My past experiences told me that Lola was sick, and I needed to act fast in order to save her life. After dirty looks and attempts at avoidance, Lola was separated and treated with a gentle metronidazole solution. After a week on medication, Lola began to eat again and was enthusiastically reunited with her peers.   This situation of a seemingly healthy individual with a lack of appetite is deadly. You may be wondering who would trust me with the life and death struggles of their child, and you would be surprised. You see, since the age of ten, I have cared for many individuals such as Lola and her friends. My years of experience observing, experimenting, and accumulating information have led me to be quite successful at what I do. Lola is not the first, nor will she be the last, to fall sick under my care. It is a good thing that she can't run away from me because she probably would. In fact, she has no legs, is cold blooded, has scales, and breathes underwater.   Yes, Lola is a fish and is one of the many that I have cared for over the twelve years that I have been an aquarist (or ichthyophile, as I prefer). My simple hobby has evolved into a scientific endeavor as I constantly seek ways to improve the growth rate, color, and breeding success of my fish. Aside from my passionate interest in fish, I attribute much of my success to several factors: my caring personality, my scientific mind, and my attention to detail -- all traits that will assuredly serve any physician well.  I realized my passion to care for others unexpectedly. My employment at Sunrise Assisted Living where I served residents at mealtimes was at first just another college job. My low expectations of job satisfaction were pleasantly shattered when I found myself doing more than simply serving and cleaning dishes. Through assisting and guiding the residents with choosing meal options (and even occasionally helping those who had lost their motor skills eat), I discovered a true passion for caring for others. I was deeply saddened to see the physical and mental deterioration that some of the residents experienced, and this realization fueled my passion to provide better care and ensure that they knew they were important to me. And while the occasional grumpy or food-throwing, linen-hoarding resident (a true story) made work an adventure, I always found myself leaving in a better mood than I was in when I had arrived.   My desire to care for others complements my interest in science, specifically my fascination with both the healthy and the diseased human condition. My time conducting research at the Institute of Gerontology, and later at Keck Graduate Institute, allowed me to explore my interest in medical research. Through learning how to conduct single muscle-fiber and histological-biopsy research, I honed my analytical reasoning skills while developing an understanding of the demands of research. Above all else, I have learned the importance of collaboration paired with independence and of persistence paired with dedication.  A caring personality and scientific mind are nothing if one lacks focus and attention to detail. My background as an engineer, along with my work at the Clinical Trials Office as Clinical Subjects Coordinator, has given me an appreciation for, and a chance to sharpen my attention to, details.  Besides learning much about clinical research, I have had the opportunity to see that small details, such as the minute scoring of Graft versus Host Disease or a patient's single episode of eczema ten years ago, are very important.  These experiences have ignited in me a desire to conduct clinical research, and they have helped me realize that being a physician is truly my passion.   My dedication to being a physician is unyielding, and if there is anything I have learned through the experience of applying to medical school a second time, it is just how certain I am that I want to spend my life caring for others. I have used my time to better my mind and myself as a person. My trip to the mountains of India, where I spent a month providing medical care to the villagers of the remote Kashmir region, was an educational and emotional enlightenment. In addition to gaining hands-on field experience, I learned volumes about the culture and state of medicine in a far away land. Additionally, my current study of Epidemiology in a MPH program will give me the understanding to tackle the challenges of disease from a preventative as well as a curative point of view.  I look forward to utilizing my passion, scientific mind, and attention to detail in medicine as I already have in caring for a patient such as Lola. And although you may be thinking that I am some kind of fish-crazed weirdo, I assure you that I am a relatively normal guy -- at least that is what Lola tells me. Emergency Department Research Assistant I am currently volunteering my time as a research assistant for the University of Michigan Injury Research Center, which is part of the Department of Emergency Medicine. One of my projects has been to assist with launching an Emergency Department (ED) study aimed at using Motivational Interviewing to increase adolescent seatbelt use. I have been developing study materials including intervention brochures, screening interview questions, and data code books. I am also working on a study aimed at identifying behavioral risk factors for gun access among adolescents presenting to an urban ED. I am responsible for compiling the study results, conducting data anaylsis, performing a literature review, and writing the final manuscript. My work at the IRC has been instrumental in allowing me to apply what I have learned in my MPH program to a research study., Academic Awards I graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering with magna cum laude distinction from the University of Michigan in December 2006. During my four years at Michigan, I received several academic awards, as follows: Dean's List: 04/30/2004, 12/31/2004, 12/31/2005, 12/31/2006 University Honors: 12/19/2004, 12/18/2005, 12/31/2006, Assisted Living Dining Room Staff I initially chose to work at Sunrise to make some money and help me get through school, but I quickly found that it was much more than just a job. Sunrise was my first experience with one-on-one patient interaction. My job responsibilities included taking and delivering resident meal orders, assisting residents to eat and get to and from their rooms, and cleaning the dining room and kitchen. I also helped with resident activities such as Bingo and Movie Night. Additionally, I often assisted the residents with eating and drinking. This experience was pivotal in helping me realize my interest in working with patients in a clinical setting, and I gained a great deal of satisfaction in my interactions with the residents., Kargiakh Medical Mission I participated in a medical expedition to the northen mountains of India and Tibet through an independent group called the Himalayan Health Exchange. During the month that we were in-country, we hiked in the mountainous regions of northern India and provided medical care for the various villages that dot the region. Many of these villages are totally inaccessible to outside contact for much of the year due to poor weather conditions, and the medical care in the region is sparse to non-existent. As a member of the expedition, I was able to have hands-on experience in direct patient care activities, from conducting a physical exam to deciding on the best course of treatment and advice to give to the patients. I was also involved in running the pharmacy, which included the very challenging task of ensuring each patient understood the directions for their medication. This experience allowed me to get out into the field and get some hands-on experience that would have been hard to attain here in the United States. I learned so much not only about field medicine and basic medical skills, but also about the state of healthcare in another country, and how many people around the world are missing basic access to care., Standardized Patient I presently work as a standardized patient for the Clinical Comprehensive Assessment exams through the University of Michigan Medical School. As a standardized patient, I am responsible for portraying multiple roles in simulated medical interviews and physical exams and then providing assessments and feedback to the medical students on their performances. Through this experience, I have been able to observe the progression of medical knowledge and interpersonal skills of the medical students throughout their medical education. I have gained valuable insight into both sides of the physician-patient relationship, and I now have a better understanding of what is expected and required of a physician in the clinical setting., Physician Shadowing I shadowed Dr. Hussain in the oncology clinic every week during the Winter Semester of 2006. Dr. Hussain and her colleagues gave me exposure to the outpatient clinic, and I was able to visit with patients and observe the physical exam and the interaction of the physicians in deciding upon a clinical course. In addition, Dr. Hussain and her team gave me an informative introduction to urologic oncology and the clinical features of disease. I was also able to observe one of her colleagues, Dr. David Wood, perform a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy., Hospital Volunteer I volunteered in the outpatient clinic and intensive care unit for the Trauma Burn Unit. In the outpatient setting I was responsible for interviewing patients to get pre-exam health information. I was also responsible for keeping the clinic staff updated on room occupancy status and making sure patients knew where to go to. In the ICU I assisted the nursing staff with dressing changes, patient transport, and general unit supply issues. I also visited with patients and their families and helped them with any issues they were having. My volunteering was a great learning experience and I am very glad I was able to spend my time this way., Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) Program I was enrolled in the NROTC program during my first year in college, and for this I was awarded a full academic scholarship. The ROTC program consisted of taking military classes, weekly physical training sessions, mandatory proctored study hall sessions, weekly drill periods, and various exercises such as uniform inspections and Military Ball. I also participated in Drill Team, which gave me extra exposure to marching in formation.  I was awarded the American Legion Award for Military Excellence at the end of the 2002-2003 school year. This award was given to me for high academic, physical, and military performance. Additionally, my company won the Platoon Competition, which was a yearly battalion-wide marching competition. My ROTC experience was a very positive one, and I learned much about military life and being a disciplined and honorable person., Study Group Leader I worked as a Study Group Leader for Chemistry 130, an introductory inorganic Chemistry class. I was responsible for leading a group of twelve undergraduate students in group discussion for two hours each week during the semester. In order to prepare for each meeting I reviewed the current class material and put together an agenda for each session. During each meeting I helped facilitate group discussion and gave the group direction as to how to focus their study efforts. I also attended monthly leader training sessions aimed at improving facilitation and communication techniques. This position gave me the opportunity to develop my leadership and mentorship skills with my peers. I developed a passion for teaching and guiding other individuals to help them learn and understand new information. I also became very comfortable developing and maintaining a positive group dynamic., Red Robin Server and Exporter I worked at Red Robin during the summer of my freshman year and throughout my sophomore year of college. I worked as a server and food exporter. As a server, I took and delivered guest food and drink orders. As an exporter, I was responsible for preparing and grouping guest orders off of the food line. Working at Red Robin allowed me to work within a team environment on a single goal, which was customer satisfaction. My work also allowed me to interact with a wide range of individuals, and I gained an appreciation of the challenges of working in the food service industry., Keck Research Intern My research at the Keck Graduate Institute was conducted though the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program funded by the National Science Foundation. I worked on a project aimed at verfying a metabolic model of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. I had the opportunity to to learn microbiological culture techniques and to run controlled fermentation experiments. I was able to build upon my prior research experience at school in a more independent and project-based manner. Throughout the summer I was responsible for giving several presentations to the faculty, ultimately culminating in a final research paper., Clinical Research Subjects Coordinator My responsibilities as Clinical Subjects Coordinator included serving as Study Coordinator for UMCC 2005.054, an investigational skin biopsy study. I also coordinated the University of Michigan's National Donor Marrow Program Patient Follow-Up Initiative, which involved meeting a data submission benchmark of 90% of forms due for each reporting cycle. In addition, I worked with Study Coordinators on Standard of Care data reports for every patient receiving a stem call transplant at U of M. I also worked closely with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Research Coordinators both in preparing for and during Study Monitor Visits. I worked with research nurses, study monitors, physicians, and study coordinators on a daily basis, and I was also able to go on rounds with the transplant physicians and observe our patients firsthand. This has been a great opportunity to learn the details of oncology and the transplant process, and it has given me valuable experience in conducting the type of clinical trials work that I hope to continue as a physician., Biomedical Engineering Society Committee Chair The Biomedical Engineering Society is a student-run organization composed of both undergraduate and graduate students in the Biomedical Engineering Department. The goals of the group are to learn about the field of BME, connect with the BME community, and promote the study of BME on campus. I was a member of BMES for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 academic years. I was also the chair of the Logistical Committee for the 2005-2006 year. My responsibilities were to organize monthly group meetings, study sessions, community service activities, and social outings. I worked with a small group of students in planning and executing group activities, and I found this to be a great way to improve my communication and interpersonal skills in a leadership position., Student Research Assistant This was my first exposure to basic biomedical lab research. One of the projects I worked on involved collecting data for a human single muscle fiber study which involved learning to tie single muscle fibers to a force tranducing system. I also performed muscle biopsy sectioning, staining, and protein assay experiments. These techniques were acquired through working on several different research projects, and gave me the opportunity to work within a team setting as well as on my own. I enjoyed my research experience and learned that I am very interested in conducting some form of research in the future."

    "text": "Much of my inspiration to become a physician derives from the worthy exemplars of my father, an internist, and my mother, a registered nurse.  Through them, I perceive that mastery of a vast body of knowledge, nearly limitless patience and strong humanitarian principles are essential to the competent practice of medicine.  More tangentially, I have both personally and professionally known hundreds of physicians who, as a group, embody these traits.  One prime example is a physician who travels abroad each year to poverty-stricken countries.  In discussing this with him, it is clear that he might be the only physician these patients ever encounter.  While being an excellent physician does not require such efforts, I believe that his commitment provides an aspirational ideal of what it means to be a physician.  The desire to become a physician coalesces for me into two statements:  (1) I need to help those with problems which they cannot easily and personally overcome, and (2) I strongly aspire to the prodigious intellectual challenge which medical school and the practice of medicine represents.  A similar rationale led me to pursue the practice of law.  One might ask why do I not merely continue in that profession  After doing so for fourteen years, working in a clinical setting for six years and completing several hundred hours of clinical observations and physician shadowing, I have concluded that the assistance rendered in the physician-patient relationship will hold greater personal meaning for me.  Many aspirants likely have personal accounts of loved ones whom they wish they could have helped, and I am no different.  My clinical experiences have only strengthened my desire to seek the knowledge imparted by a medical education.  Currently, I can do nothing to alleviate a patient's problems, but my aspiration will be realized upon becoming a physician.  I have experienced similar gratification as a lawyer.  I know its worth.  I would like to take the opportunity to briefly address certain points in my academic record.  For several years after college (during which I attended law school and took inorganic chemistry), I was treated for depression and resultant physical problems due to a rather grave personal loss.  Delaying my studies would have been prudent, but I failed to appreciate this at the time.  In retrospect, however, I view this period as a vital tempering indispensable to the personal resolve and work ethic I possess today.  Accordingly, I believe that my more recent academic achievements better represent my abilities.  With the exception of organic chemistry (in which only a single A was given), I have received the top ranking in every post-baccalaureate class (all remaining science and math prerequisites) I have taken since 2005, with a GPA of 3.82.  Additionally, I have just completed a Master's in Bioethics at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, graduating at the top of my class with a 4.0 GPA.  Once I have completed medical school and a residency in internal medicine, my intention is to gradually assume responsibility for my father's practice, which represents 4,000 patients.  Thus, in pursuing this path, I will not merely be fulfilling a personal desire, but will also play an instrumental role in providing continuity of care to a significant number of people.  There is one final matter which I will address.  I realize that some might question the utility of allowing a 39-year old admission.  However, I should be able to practice for at least thirty years, particularly if my father is any indication.  To me, this fact adequately satisfies any utilitarian analysis of my candidacy.  I believe that I have adequately demonstrated my abilities as an adult learner, and, moreover, I have kept-up with technological trends.  I also believe that my age and work/life experience could add to both class breadth and depth.  For example, I have enjoyed a certain amount of professional success, hold advanced degrees in law and bioethics, worked full-time for six years in a health care setting, held great professional responsibility, performed a large amount of pro bono activities, lived in multiple states and visited nearly two dozen countries to see how others live.  During law school, a classmate who was a 40-year old mother of three became the law review editor.  At the time, I wondered what drove her to this impressive achievement.  I now understand.  The gravity of occurrences in one's life dramatically shifts with time.  Now, I am the 40-year old.  I realize that admission committees require objective standards to evaluate applicants and also that many of these applicants will present as superior to me.  All I may ask is that the Committee view my age at worst as a neutral factor.  I believe it a positive, but opinions can differ.  Few candidates will labor as hard as I during my medical education, and I will not number among the attrited.  The decision to depart my past profession was not taken lightly, and I fully comprehend the commitment of the coming years.  If given the opportunity, I will eagerly -- and gratefully -- embrace the challenges ahead, striving to do justice to the place entrusted to me.  Thank you for considering my candidacy. Healthcare Attorney As a healthcare attorney, I primarily advised physicians, surgeons, group practices and hospitals on various aspects of the corporate and regulatory law applicable to them.  Additionally, I oversaw various mergers and acquisitions of relevant healthcare related entities.  It was during this time that I began to strongly feel that I should pursue medicine as a career, although it took me a number of years to actually take definitive steps in this direction.  A great deal of impetus was provided by constant contact with many physician clients (I have represented at least 400 physicians and surgeons as legal counsel), some of whom even became friends.  These friendships further encouraged my desire to change career paths., Graduate Student Senate Representative During the master's program in bioethics at Case Western Reserve University, I served as the departmental representative to the graduate student senate.  Primarily, this involved attending Senate meetings, expressing constituent concerns to the Senate, assisting in policy development and reporting to constituents on actions taken by the Senate.  One key initiative focus of the Senate was to obtain better health and dental insurance coverage for graduate students.  This was ultimately accomplished., Clinical Observations During the pursuit of a master's in bioethics, I completed over 200 hours of clinical observations at University Hospitals, the MetroHealth System and the Hospice of Western Reserve, all in Cleveland, Ohio.  During these rotations, I observed in the following areas:  MICU, SICU, CICU, NICU, PICU, BICU, NSU, emergency department, psychiatric consult & liaison, genetic counseling, arrhythmia/vascular service, palliative care, neonatology, heart transplantation, long stay committee, ethics consultation service, institutional review board, ob/gyn ethics, hospice, social work and pastoral care., Mergers & Acquisitions Attorney For several years, I pursued general transactional law, while retaining a number of physician clients.  I credit this time with teaching me two important lessons, both of which I believe will serve me well as a physician.  First was a strong sense of responsibility.  I have personally concluded $300 million in commercial transactions, the majority before I attained the age of 30.  While mergers and acquisitions have little to do with patient care, I offer this to demonstrate that many clients entrusted me with large sums of capital.  People act differently when money is involved, taking umbrage where they might normally let something pass.  I count it as a high privilege that I was so entrusted.  Though money and human lives are two very different things, I believe that responsibility learned in one arena is applicable in another.  Indeed, if I learned to give 110% when entrusted with money and corporate assets, should I not try even harder when entrusted with a human life  The answer is self-evident.  The second lesson was that one must put in the time required, even if it is extreme.  As an attorney, I routinely worked 100 hours/week, and was the top-billing associate at both firms where I practiced.  This was both expected and necessary.  I expect nothing less as a physician., Primary Care Practice Manager I assisted my father in managing his 4,000 patient primary care solo practice.  He is an internist/ID Fellow with nearly 40 years' experience.  The practice's large underserved catchment area is in the Appalachian fringe of Southeastern Ohio.  The practice is quite vibrant, including a full laboratory, x-ray, ultrasound, mammography, bone densitometry and a small pharmacy.  In addition to day-to-day business management, I oversaw all ancillary services.  The most valuable aspect of this experience has been the exposure to clinical primary care medicine which I received.  I was accorded unlimited access to all parts of the practice, including extensive patient interaction.  (Please reference other experiences listed.)  Sharing this experience with my father has been truly rewarding for me.  Indeed, it provided the impetus which led me to apply.  I believe the depth of this experience is unrivaled by any other type of experience I could have had.  I daily witnessed both the ups and downs of primary care medicine.  Unlike a short-lived internship/clerkship, my father encouraged me to gain intimate familiarity with all aspects of his practice.  Though I am certainly biased, I do not believe that I could have asked for a better role model., Lecturer I have periodically served as a pro bono guest lecturer at a local university branch campus in undergraduate law courses, teaching on topics such as commercial practices, contracts and corporate law.  Additionally, in November 2008, I was a featured speaker at the Student National Medical Association Region V Conference in Cleveland.  I spoke on the topic of physicians as contributors to health policy.  These experiences have whetted my desire to pursue teaching, at least on an adjunct basis, in the future, particularly in the area of bioethics., Neuro and Vascular Technician I performed non-invasive diagnostic testing, including ultrasound vascular scanning, autonomic system evaluation and nerve conduction studies.  A primary focus is testing related to complications stemming from Type II diabetes mellitus.  My father's practice comprises a large percentage of patients with Type II diabetes, many of whom suffer from peripheral atherosclerosis and neuropathy.  My father also conducts cardiac stress testing in the office, with which I assist.  This has been invaluable in gaining a rudimentary understanding of cardiac functions.  I also perform other duties such as phlebotomy, EKG's and pulmonary function testing.  Over the last several years, I have performed literally thousands of these various tests, spending many hours one-on-one with patients.  Of all my experiences, functioning in this role has provided me with more insight and more drive to become a physician than any other.  There is a certain fragility to most patients, stemming from their need to know what is wrong with them.  The presence of someone who can offer a kind word and carry out the required (and sometimes unpleasant) procedures in a compassionate manner seems to make all the difference.  Patients place a high value on a considerate listener.  This experience has helped me hone this skill., Assistant Journal Editor I served as an assistant editor on the Case Western Reserve University School of Law's Journal of International Law (JIL).  JIL has received a top 20 rating for journals of its type.  Responsibilities primarily centered around researching and editing Notes which had been submitted for publication in the Journal.  These covered a broad array of international legal issues.  The position provided me with the opportunity to work with experienced, published authors on a wide variety of topics., Attorney Volunteer I volunteered with the Orange County Constitutional Rights Foundation as attorney-juror and attorney-advisor.  The first role was with a Mock Trial program designed to familiarize high school students with the judicial system.  It conducted mock civil trials in which the students filled all roles typical to such a proceeding, excepting that of judge (filled by a sitting member of the Orange County Superior Court) and jury (comprising two local attorneys).  As attorney-juror, I was the fact finder who rendered a verdict at the trial's conclusion based upon the merits of the evidence presented by the student participants.  Feedback was also provided on participants' performance.  The second role was with Peer Court, a diversion program for first time juvenile offenders who would otherwise be normally adjudicated.  A sitting juvenile judge presides as both law and fact finder, just as in real juvenile proceedings.  The role of the attorney-advisor is to counsel either the student prosecutor or defense counsel on points of law, such as presentation of evidence and objections.  As this was a real proceeding, with actual sentencing by the accused's peers, it was important that proper procedure was followed.  This is a valuable program that gives minor offenders a chance to redeem themselves., Congressional Researcher I was a member of a team of four law students who were tasked with production of a faculty-managed scholarly review of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  This review was commissioned by what is currently called the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor.  As a review commissioned by Congress, this article was not, to my knowledge, published in any federal publication.  Nor would it have been published as a law review article, though it was a Note-caliber work.  The purpose of the article was to assist members of the Committee who, at the time,  were considering amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Our submission date was May, 1995., Shadowing Experience In an effort to widen my experiences and to gain greater understanding of various specialties, I have shadowed several local physicians and surgeons.  To date, I have observed in cardiology, neurosurgery, general surgery, urology, gastroenterology, otolaryngology and dermatology.  These opportunities tend to be relatively short in duration (days to a week or two), during which I have been permitted to shadow the physician or surgeon during examinations and consultations.  Additionally, I have been permitted to scrub in to observe a variety of surgical procedures.  These experiences have been tremendously interesting.  In addition to seeing a variety of cases, I have also been able to observe the similarities and differences employed by various practitioners in their physician-patient interactions.  Needless to say, each experience has further strengthened my desire to become a physician., Medical Conferences Since 2003, I have also attended most all CME conferences attended by my father.  These have covered widely varying topics from advanced diabetic care to medical aesthetics to peripheral vascular disease to CMS coding practice.  Additionally, I attended a preceptorship with my father under Dr. Brian Heil, a plastic surgeon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania regarding laser-based aesthetic procedures.  Most recently, my father and I attended a program in Boston sponsored by Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital on the genetic basis of adult medicine.  This was a fascinating experience which coincided with my existing interests.  My future endeavors in bioethics will center on genetics and related technologies., Medical Aesthetics Practice Owner The majority of our patients consult for rhytid and vascular remediation (e.g., rosacea, varicosities), acne treatments and hair reduction.  Botulinum toxin, dermal fillers, cryogens and light-based modalities are used to effectuate treatment.  I participate in all patient consultations with my father, as well as directly assist in every procedure performed.  Interviewing prospective patients has given me valuable perception into human thought processes in the medical context (including the necessity to sometimes try a different tack to gain all pertinent details).  In many respects, such interviewing skills do not differ greatly from those required of lawyers.  In short, the experience has provided beneficial psychological insight.  Assisting in hundreds of procedures has also provided me with significant patient interaction.  I have learned a great deal regarding post-procedure wound care, as I am directly responsible for this.  I count this as a very valuable preparatory experience, as it has yielded both practical skills, as well as some insight into the non-verbal cues to which a good practitioner must be attuned., Guardian ad Litem/Attorney The role of a guardian ad litem (GAL) is to protect children per the best interests standard.  Court appointed representation in this context arises in abuse, neglect and dependency cases.  Generally, the children have been removed from their parents.  Over the past 6 years, I have represented dozens of children, including a case of conjoined twins which gained national media coverage.  The value of the role is underscored in that parents  are generally represented by counsel.  Children's Services is represented by the prosecutor's office.  This leaves the defenseless minors (many of whom are mentally limited from a mother's prenatal drug use or have been physically or sexually abused) undefended.  A GAL's only priority is to represent the child's interests.  I have performed all GAL representation on a pro bono basis.  To date, I have waived over $60,000 in legal fees for the people of my state (at normal billing rates, the sum exceeds $250,000).  While heart rending at times, being a GAL is one of the most rewarding things I have ever done.  Children from disadvantaged backgrounds suffer disparately in such situations.  I believe that I have been able to make a positive difference in their lives.  If I had to select one way in which I have positively contributed to the world, it is this., Graduate Teaching Assistant While a master's student, I assisted professor with his undergraduate bioethics course.  Duties included lecturing if professor was absent, meeting with/advising students regarding coursework, writing skills tutoring, grading papers, coordinating guest speakers, etc."

    "text": "I admit it. I was one of those toddlers who, upon the receipt of her first Fisher Price doctor's kit, started smiling sweetly with my plastic stethoscope around my neck, telling all interested adults that I was going to be a pediatrician when I grew up. From age three all through high school, I stuck with it. As an older child, rather than going through a string of different career plans, I remained fiercely loyal to my future in medicine. When other dreams occurred to me, I didn't waiver, I simply tacked them on to my plan. When I grow up, I thought to myself at ten or eleven, I will be doctor with an Oscar on the shelf (from her younger, less serious days) who writes children's novels in her spare time. It seemed like a good plan.  But maybe the path can't be so straight. Though I entered college declaring myself premed with a biochemistry major, it was not smooth sailing. Bad advice and the good student's feeling of academic invincibility led me to enroll in organic chemistry first semester of my freshman year. I started out in over my head; it did not go well, and it almost derailed me. I wondered how I could even hope to be a physician when I had failed so spectacularly at the outset of my college career.   Looking back though, I am glad for that mistake. Second semester, I filled the slot in my schedule formerly occupied by organic with introductory psychology II, the portion of the psychology sequence that focused on neuroscience. The course was thrilling for me. In it I found my new niche and a new path. While it has been longer and less direct than the one that I initially envisioned, it has led me back to my dreams of spending my adult days in a white coat.   After the organic chemistry incident, I went through the rest of college feeling skeptical about medical school. I finished the prerequisites, and I finally defeated organic chemistry, but I didn't enjoy them as much as I'd imagined I might. I found myself just fitting the classes into a schedule that I overloaded almost every semester to give myself a chance to take the courses that I found more intellectually exciting or just plain fun: psychopharmacology and cognitive neuroscience, drawing and painting. As I approached the end of my senior year, I was unsure about what to do next. While my thesis research on Prozac and Ritalin in the American culture made me certain that I wanted a career in mental health, I still didn't feel ready to commit to medical school.   So I went with a plan of, And now for something completely different! I applied to Teach For America, and was placed as a secondary school science teacher in New Orleans starting in the fall of 2005. After a summer of training, I had only seven days with my students before Hurricane Katrina hit. I evacuated ahead of the storm and watched the destruction from a distance, horrified and unsure of what the future would bring.   I was headed back home to Connecticut to figure that out after the extent of the damage was clear when I stopped to visit family in northern Virginia. Sitting over dinner one night, my aunt suggested that I take a look at what was available at NIH. A brief visit to the website led me to the IRTA program, and with a rapidity that still seems amazing to me, I found myself a member of James Blair's lab in the Unit on Affective and Cognitive Neuroscience, Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program, National Institute of Mental Health.  I've been at NIMH for almost two years now, but my dream for the future became clear to me within a month of my arrival. The research that I have been able to participate in here is possibly the most engaging and exciting experience of my life, and the environment of the research hospital, from the very beginning, felt like coming home.   The joy that I found in the research community inspired me to look at medicine again, and I began to explore other elements of a medical career. With each new step I have been thrilled with what I've found. Seeing physicians and medical research in action has allowed me to become focused on a level that I never felt as an undergraduate, and this focus has allowed me to grasp opportunities that have been informative, rewarding and inspiring. Each medically related experience I have enjoyed in the last two years has made me more certain that medicine is the career for me. The patient contact that I have in my volunteer position with the HELP program is deeply satisfying, the more medically focused classes that I took at the University of Maryland were constantly fascinating, and my position as an ER scribe allows me to spend time with physicians in an environment that from the very outset has felt dynamic and vibrant.  I have friends that tell a tale of trying research or shadowing a doctor and realizing that medicine was not for them, but I have had the opposite experience. Before I came to research full time, I didn't understand what a career in medicine entailed, even though I thought that I had been planning on one for my entire life. Now, with each chance that I have to see medicine in action, I become more excited about making my career in a field that now seems no longer daunting, but instead challenging and fulfilling, a chance to spend my lifetime perpetually learning. HELP Program Volunteer at iNOVA Fairfax Hospital I am a volunteer for the Hospital Elder Life Program. The goal of the program is to provide elderly patients in the hospital with resources and human contact to help them to remain alert and oriented during their hospital stay and increase the chances that they will be able to return home self-sufficiently. During each volunteer shift, I visit with the patients that are enrolled in the program, and perform a number of different interventions, depending on their needs and the severity of their illness. These interventions include just visiting and conversing with them about their history and family, providing reading and listening material, assisting with meals, and mobility exercises including range of motion and assisted walks., 2007 Cognitive Neuroscience Society Conference I attended the 2007 Cognitive Neuroscience Society Conference with members of my lab., Intramural Research Training Award Fellow at NIMH I have worked full time at the National Institute of Mental Health as an Intramural Research Training Award Fellow in the Unit on Affective Cognitive Neuroscience in the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program. In this position I have had the opportunity to work on a number of different projects, including fMRI experiments, neurocognitive testing and pharmacological studies., Player/Captain Boston College Women's Ultimate Frisbee I was a player, and later a captain of the Boston College Women's Club Ultimate Frisbee team. In this position I participated in and led twice weekly evening practices and helped to organize participation in and travel to intercollegiate competitions both with local universities and at regional tournaments., Resident Assistant in Greycliff Hall, Boston College I was the Resident Assistant in Greycliff Hall, the honors dormitory at Boston College. In this position I was responsible for both social and educational programming for 40 residents, mostly first year students in the Arts and Sciences Honors Program. In addition, with a co-RA, I was responsible for the enforcement of university residential life policy. The position involved mediating conflicts between my residents and serving as a peer advisor. In addition I created bulletin boards, and helped to connect my residents with other resources in the community when they needed assistance., Anne Arundel Medical Center ER Scribe I work two shifts a week in the Emergency Room at Anne Arundel Medical Center as a part of the scribe program. In this position, I shadow the ER physicians and aid them in record keeping by making notes regarding the history, present complaint, and treatments performed for each patient. As a scribe I am also responsible for checking and recording laboratory and radiology results as they come back and reporting them to the physician. The experience has been a wonderful opportunity to see emergency physicians in action in the hospital environment., StudySmart Tutor I worked part time for a private tutoring company called StudySmart.  I tutored several high school students to help them improve their performance in courses including biology, chemistry, physics, algebra and geometry. We met in one-on-one sessions once or twice a week. I had the pleasure of working with two of my students throughout two academic years, while I worked with others for only a semester or two.  I also took students in StudySmart's SAT preparation program, a structured one-on-one program designed to improve their SAT score., Residence Hall Employment Throughout my college career I worked for 10-12 hours a week in a work-study position. I served as the monitor for the facilities in the residence hall, including libraries and weight rooms., Editor: Naked Singularity Magazine Throughout my college career, I was on the editorial staff of the literary magazine Naked Singularity at Boston College. During my freshman year, I served primarily as the publicity editor, creating and posting flyers soliciting submissions and advertising new issues. In later years I continued in that capacity and also helped to select submissions for publication and copy edit the submissions that were selected. The time involved was variable, with some weeks requiring no time, and others, while selecting submissions or reviewing layout, involving several longer meetings."

    "text": "The putrid odor smacked me in the face when I entered the room to help the nurse. Joe, an unconscious thirty-year-old suffering from a severe case of necrotizing fasciitis, lay on the bed. From his knees to his chest, Joe was wrapped in bandages that were soaked in yellow serous fluid. Before entering the room, I had found it odd when the nurse asked me if I would be all right; for six months I had worked in this ICU, and the sight of a grievous injury had become a regular occurrence. Most of the nurses, however, shied away from this patient, and as we changed the bandages I began to understand why. A few days prior Joe had cut himself, and an infection, a flesh-eating bacteria, had forced the surgeons to remove huge sections of Joe's body.  I have always been able to detach myself from my emotions. While working as a baseball umpire, I first discovered this talent. I routinely found myself assigned as the home plate umpire because of my ability to remain focused, especially when an obvious bad call had been made on the field. Even after I knew there was no way to rectify a mistake, I was able to keep my emotions in check and withstand a screaming coach and a stand full of angry fans. This skill was effective in the surgical ICU where I worked for two and a half years. Confronted by burn victims, severely critical patients, and hysterical family members I was able to perform my duties in a calm and capable manner.  In the ICU I witnessed the effects of poverty, addiction and violence in the community. Our hospital cared for the majority of the city's underprivileged and low income patients, many of whom had no health insurance or regular medical care. They often suffered from easily curable diseases, but a lack of available treatment allowed their health to deteriorate until they ended up in the hospital. Frequently the unit would be filled to capacity with these patients, and we would work feverishly to attend to as many as possible. Although exhausted, I would still feel like there was more that I should do for these patients. My position limited me to following orders from the nurses and doctors, and I soon discovered that I wanted the responsibility of having a more valuable role.   Going to work was something to which I always looked forward. I would perform hourly rounds recording vital signs, testing blood sugars, and measuring inputs and outputs. I would also help the nurses with their duties which included patient hygiene and repositioning. When patients had to go to the CT scan or x-ray, I would transport them around the hospital. These duties gave me the opportunity to watch how different pathologies and injuries were treated over a long period of time. Working at a teaching hospital also allowed me to learn about procedures such as chest tube insertions, ventriculostomies, and broncoscopies. Additionally, I often would help the doctors by setting up the equipment before a procedure or by gathering additional supplies while keeping the working area sterile. The actions of the physicians in these cases would often elicit rapid improvements in a patient's condition. I became intrigued with the skill and wealth of knowledge of the attending physicians, and my desire increased to become a doctor myself.  As an EMT I've felt limited not only in my understanding, but in my ability to mend injuries and treat illness. My job conflicted with my innate desire to figure out the world around me and manipulate it. As a child I would take apart toys, telephones, stereos, and computers in order to figure out how they worked. Not only did all my electronic possessions work correctly, but I would often create new gadgets from various spare parts. As a student I have felt compelled to delve deeply into the subject matter of my classes. I have been passionate about all of my science classes and would go far beyond the scope of the assigned books. I most enjoyed discovering conflicting arguments among different subjects and learning how contradictory theories often coexist. Similar conflicting conditions exist within medicine, and I look forward to citing journal articles as a physician in order to determine the best course of action when treating patients.  Helping Joe that week at the hospital gave me new insights into the multiple roles of the physician. Initially the goal was to stop the infection, begin the healing process and get Joe back on his feet. Eventually, however, his condition deteriorated and the limits of medicine became apparent. Alleviating Joe's pain became our sole mission. We provided him with dignity, and his family was grateful for our efforts. Joe's situation highlighted for me the importance of focusing my efforts on aiding the patient despite the potential outcome. As a physician I hope to be a superb diagnostician, an inquisitive researcher, or a skilled surgeon who always provides compassionate care for those I treat.

    "text": "Perched on a ridge at 14,000 feet above sea level, I looked out across the Andes mountains. Two days of strenuous hiking had led me here, to the highest point on my route to the Incan city of Machu Picchu. I was out of breath and light-headed from the altitude, but there was no time to rest. Scott, my younger brother, was already bounding down the mountain ahead of me, unfazed by the ascent and eager to continue our journey! Although no one would have believed it that day, Scott is a cancer survivor. At age three, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. For the next two years, I looked on helplessly as Scott underwent brutal regiments of chemotherapy and radiation. I listened as my parents, noticeably shaken but never without hope, tried to explain why Scott was so sick. I witnessed the stubborn persistence of cancer, but also the resilience of the human body. And I observed how skilled doctors, always calm and in control, could outsmart even the wiliest of adversaries.  \tScott's battle with cancer was my eye-opening introduction to the world of medicine. Watching my younger brother fight off such a ruthless disease had a profound and lasting impact on my life. The experience fostered in me a deep respect for the seriously ill, as well as for the courageous people who selflessly care for them. Scott's situation often caused me to pause and reflect upon my own good health. I knew that while I was playing basketball outside, he was most likely lying in a dark room with radiation bombarding his head and spine or sitting in bed with his central line protruding from his chest. Growing up alongside Scott instilled in me a desire to help improve the quality of life for the less fortunate. On a more personal level, caring for him taught me valuable lessons about love and compassion. I feel privileged to have played a role, however small, in helping Scott become the healthy and successful teenager he is today. Most of all, I cherish the unique relationship that he and I still share.  \tMedicine is particularly intriguing to me because it is both a distinctly humanistic endeavor, as Scott's ordeal revealed, and a challenging intellectual pursuit. At UVa, I explored this dichotomy by balancing my coursework with clinical and volunteer activities. I also chose to get involved in scientific research, and I soon realized that I had a natural affinity for the lab. I found myself eager to pursue every research opportunity I could in the hopes of contributing something new and unique to the constantly growing pool of scientific knowledge. At UVa, I worked with physicians and scientists to test newly designed nanoparticles and evaluate their usefulness as contrast agents for the imaging of atherosclerotic plaques. After graduating, instead of applying directly to medical school, I chose to take a job as a research associate at the University of Cincinnati, where for the last year I have used my biomedical engineering background to design and test new methods for imaging blood and lymph flow in zebrafish. I am currently researching the role of regurgitant blood flow during normal heart valve development, and hopefully my research will shed light on the underlying causes of some congenital valve defects. My research experiences, particularly my investigations into the role of fluid flow in development and disease at UC, have directly shaped my conviction to pursue medicine, a profession which is inextricably linked to advances in scientific understanding.  \tMy intellectual curiosity and passion for science are matched only by my desire to help others. Volunteer experiences have offered me the opportunity to form meaningful relationships and share my talents; they have also taught me valuable lessons and improved my communication and leadership skills. As the coach of a first-grade soccer team, I learned more about patience than I ever thought possible, and as a TA for an introductory biology course, I realized how rewarding it was to help a struggling student. Volunteering in the emergency room was particularly poignant, because it brought back memories of Scott's days in the hospital and reminded me that medicine is an inescapably emotional and interpersonal affair. My job was to approach patients and enroll them in research studies, a seemingly simple task that often proved very difficult in the fast-paced, high-stress atmosphere of a level-1 trauma center. The work demanded extensive interaction with a diverse group of people, many of whom were distressed and uncooperative, and I quickly realized that a respectful attitude, a professional demeanor, and a candid smile were more important than any amount of knowledge or preparation.  \t Looking back, it is truly amazing to think that my brother Scott, a child stricken with cancer, would one day be able to conquer the Andes mountains, but modern technology and talented physicians have made this a reality. Medicine is vibrant and fulfilling, replete with stimulating intellectual challenges and complex interpersonal relationships. By committing myself to a career as a physician, I want to experience medicine to the fullest and make a meaningful contribution to this exciting profession. Research Associate at the University of Cincinnati After graduating from UVa with a degree in biomedical engineering, I took a full-time job as a Research Associate in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology at the University of Cincinnati's College of Medicine. I currently work in the laboratory of Jay Hove, PhD, where I study the role of fluid flow in development and disease using the zebrafish as a model organism. I am particularly interested in flow within the cardiovascular, renal, and lymphatic systems, and for my current project I am developing advanced intravital microscopy and imaging techniques to quantify in vivo fluid dynamics and investigate the relationship between regurgitant blood flow and the natural formation of heart valves. I also worked in Dr. Hove's laboratory during the summer of 2004 and completed a project, which was later published, to determine the dose-dependent efficacy of several chemical agents commonly used in zebrafish research. During my two years in the lab, I have gained extensive exposure to a medical research environment and have mastered numerous research techniques., Radiology Department Volunteer As a volunteer in the UVa Radiology Department, I helped create an electronic atlas of x-ray images depicting the normal maturation of the human skeleton from birth to 21 years of age. I was specifically assigned two body parts, the knee and the femur, and was responsible for locating, cataloging, and selecting representative x-ray images of these body parts from an online image database. Working closely with a radiology resident, I had to find normal images taken from various angles for both males and females in multiple age brackets. The images had to be of a high enough visual quality to be acceptable for inclusion into a publishable electronic reference atlas. I was cited as an official contributor in the finished product, which is titled Keats and Kahn's Roentgen Atlas of Skeletal Maturation. This electronic atlas, which functions as a free-standing Windows application, contains more than 2,300 high-quality skeletal radiographs and integrated growth charts. It was published by Lippincott, Williams, & Wilkins on October 31, 2007., Amphibian Facility Technician As an undergraduate, I worked part-time on evenings and weekends in a large facility that housed amphibians (mainly Xenopus) for use in scientific research. My responsibilities included routine feeding, cleaning, maintenance, and detailed record keeping. In addition to familiarizing me with standard animal handling and IACUC protocols, this experience gave me a true appreciation for the amount of labor needed to facilitate the care and husbandry of research animals., ER Volunteer and Academic Associate in Emergency Medicine During my final year at UVa, I spent approximately 200 hours shadowing and volunteering in the emergency room. I began by shadowing the attending physicians and residents once a week for 3 hours at a time. Once I had familiarized myself with the ER, I began volunteering as an Academic Associate as part of a unique pass/fail course called INST 203 -- Clinical Emergency Medicine Research. My main job was to approach patients, explain to them the current clinical research studies being conducted by faculty in the Emergency Department, and then enroll the patients in the study if they were eligible and wanted to participate. At the end of the semester, I helped compile and analyze some of the data that had been collected from these studies. The following semester, I served as a teaching assistant for the INST 203 class, which entailed coordinating and supervising all the Academic Associates in the Emergency Department and ensuring that sufficient progress was being made on each of the different research studies. This position demanded extensive contact and interaction with a very diverse group of patients, and it also required me to work closely with the ER physicians, residents, staff, and student volunteers in a dynamic clinical setting., Informal Study Abroad in Italy and Costa Rica During the summer of 2005, I traveled abroad to Costa Rica and Italy as part of the Jefferson Scholars Foundation foreign travel and study program. In Costa Rica, I spent five weeks at La Suerte Biological Field Station, where I learned about rainforest ecology and completed a field project in which I estimated the health of a tropical stream by way of a macroinvertebrate survey. In Italy, I learned about Italian art, architecture, and culture during a five-week stay at the Erasmus Institute in Tuscany. I also wrote an essay on the interplay between nature and civilization in modern day Tuscany. Both of these trips were meaningful experiences which greatly broadened and enhanced my undergraduate education., Physician Shadowing at a Neurology and Headache Clinic For one full week (approximately 40 hours total), I shadowed medical professionals at one of the largest pediatric headache centers in the United States. Most of my time was spent shadowing physicians (pediatric neurologists) as they saw patients in the outpatient clinic, but I also shadowed nurses, physician's assistants, and child psychologists in the 12-bed inpatient wing. I observed many different medical procedures, including basic neurological exams, an EEG, therapeutic botox injections, a spinal tap, and even a session of music relaxation therapy. I also visited Dr. Hershey's research lab and sat in on a presentation by a representative from a pharmaceutical company regarding a new clinical drug trial. Although only a week long, this experience facilitated extensive contact with physicians and patients in a variety of medical settings., Research Publications I currently have published one peer-reviewed journal article. This publication resulted from research I performed during the summer of 2004 at the University of Cincinnati's Genome Research Institute. I was primarily responsible for setting up the experiments described in the manuscript and collecting all the data. I also helped with the statistical analysis of the data sets and with the creation of the figures in the manuscript. The full citation is:  Craig MP, Gilday SD, Hove JR. Dose-dependent effects of chemical immobilization on the heart rate of embryonic zebrafish. Lab Anim (NY). 2006 Oct;35(9):41-7.  I also have three manuscripts in preparation, one about the biomechanics of fish swimming, one a review article about the role of fluid flow in disease, and the third about cardiovascular flow imaging in zebrafish.

(journal to be determined - , Teaching Assistant for Introductory Biology Lab I served as an undergraduate TA for a 20-student section of BIOL 204. This introductory biology lab course surveyed the enormous range of known life forms, from the simple to the complex, with emphasis on the structural organization and physiological features of different organisms. My job was to help guide the students through the required exercises, experiments, and dissections each week. Prior to every class, a graduate TA and I would spend 2 hours reviewing the relevant material and preparing demonstrations, microscope slides, and example dissections. Then, during the 3-hour lab period, we would answer questions and help the students perform their own experiments and dissections., Musical Outreach in the Charlottesville Community I volunteered my musical talents by helping at-risk youth write, record, and produce creative public service announcements at the Charlottesville Music Resource Center. In an attempt to engage youth in music instead of drugs and violence, the Center sponsors various after school programs and provides a state-of-the-art music studio, instruments, and recording equipment. I worked with groups of 7th and 8th graders, and with the help of the Music Resource Center's staff we created professional quality public service announcements about topics ranging from gun violence and drug abuse to recycling and healthy eating habits. In addition to the production, I played guitar and sang background vocals in many of our recordings. Our public service announcements were later aired on local Charlottesville radio., Scholarships, Awards, and Honor Societies I was the recipient of various scholarships and awards during my undergraduate education:  Jefferson Scholarship (2003-2007) for excellence in leadership, scholarship, and citizenship, which provided full tuition to UVa for 4 years.  Rodman Scholarship (2003-2007). The Rodman Scholars Program is the honors engineering program at UVa. I served as president of this program during the 2005-2006 academic year.  Anne O'Brien Leone Scholarship (2007) for leadership and excellence in scientific research, $500.  David A. Harrison III Undergraduate Research Award (2006) to fund an independent research project, $3000.  I was also inducted into various honor societies:  Tau Beta Pi (2006), the national engineering honor society.  Omicron Delta Kappa (2006), the foremost national leadership honor society. I served as the Nominations Chair for the UVa School of Engineering and Applied Science in 2006-2007.  Golden Key (2007), a national honor society., Research Assistant in Atherogenesis Laboratory I worked as a research assistant in a biomedical engineering laboratory which studied vascular mechanobiology and the molecular mechanisms underlying atherogenesis. My research began in the spring of 2006 when I received one of UVa's competitive David A. Harrison III Undergraduate Research Awards. I had applied for this $3000 award in the fall of 2005 after conceiving and proposing a research project entitled Targeting Capabilities of USPIOs on Endothelial Cell Surface Markers in the Vasculature. My project explored the feasibility of using targeted nanoparticles as molecular contrast agents for the imaging of atherosclerotic plaques. Most of my work involved testing the binding properties of various nanoparticles on cultured endothelial cells, but I also got to perform small animal MRI scans on rabbits and mice injected with different types of contrast agents. I continued working on this project throughout the summer of 2006, and it became the topic of my biomedical engineering senior thesis. My project required me to work with researchers and physicians in many different departments, including cardiology, radiology, chemistry, and biomedical engineering., Poster Presentations at National Conferences In June 2008, I attended the 8th International Conference on Zebrafish Development and Genetics in Madison, Wisconsin and presented a poster entitled Mapping Microscale Flow in Zebrafish. This poster and its accompanying published abstract represented highlights of the research I had done over the past year. At the conference, I also represented my laboratory and the University of Cincinnati at numerous workshops and seminars., Volunteer Coach and Athletics Director at Madison House Madison House is a student run non-profit organization that coordinates over 3,300 University of Virginia student volunteers, develops student leaders, and builds community partnerships. I began volunteering through Madison House in the fall of 2004 by serving as the coach of a co-ed soccer team made up of 5 and 6 year olds. In the fall of 2005 I successfully applied to be an Athletics Program Director at Madison House and was assigned to the YMCA basketball program. In addition to coaching my own basketball team, I was responsible for recruiting approximately 100 UVa students to serve as volunteer coaches at the local YMCA. I also had to organize instructional coaching clinics and supervise the student volunteers throughout the course of the basketball season. I served as an Athletics Program Director again the following year, but this time I was in charge of the larger youth soccer program, and was tasked with recruiting and managing approximately 150 volunteer soccer coaches. Volunteering through Madison House was always a refreshing and enjoyable experience because it combined my love of sports with my desire to make a positive impact on the local Charlottesville community., President of the Rodman Scholars Program The Rodman Scholars Program is the honors engineering program at the University of Virginia. Each year approximately 30 students are accepted into the program based on their stellar academic and extracurricular achievements. My peers elected me president of the Rodman Program for the 2005-2006 academic year, a position which entailed managing the day-today functions of the program as well as planning, implementing, and supervising all Rodman events. I worked extremely hard to revitalize the program, which had suffered from lackluster leadership and budget cuts in past years. My major accomplishments included completely redesigning the Rodman website, securing funding to support independent research by Rodman Scholars, and instituting a Rodman tutoring program., Undergraduate Research Network Technology Director The Undergraduate Research Network (URN), a completely student-run organization, was created in order to promote undergraduate research at UVa. URN organized social events and weekly meetings for students interested in research, sponsored workshops on different aspects of the research process, planned UVa's annual research week, hosted UVa's undergraduate research symposioum, and published the Oculus (UVa's journal of undergraduate research). I first became involved with URN in the fall of 2005 and was soon elected to a leadership role as Technology Director in 2006. In this position, I was responsible for the design and weekly maintenance of the URN website. I also provided technical expertise and support at all of URN's events. In addition, I served on the Executive Committee of URN, which met once a week and provided long-term planning and oversight for the entire organization."

    "text": "It was during my middle school years that I first thought I wanted a career as a physician.  But although my decision to seriously pursue this path came as early as my first few years of high school, it has not been exceptionally persistent throughout my undergraduate career.  I have tried to gain experience to understand what it would be like to be a doctor, and my passion for a career in medicine has never wavered.  However, it was my interest and ability in other subject areas that made me consider and explore other possible career options.  And in the end, I decided that it was medicine, after all, that was best suited for me and would be the most fulfilling. \tMy interest in medicine originally stemmed from my interest in science, which continued to develop and intensify throughout high school.  At the time, however, I was somewhat nave to the medical profession except for my own experiences with family physicians and the atypical trip to the emergency room.  To better acquaint myself with the career, I began to shadow physicians.  The most enlightening experience that I had was in the summer after I graduated high school and also the summers following my first two years of college.  I often spent days shadowing my cousin, who is an internist at a local hospital.  I learned that this type of medicine was far different than my rather enjoyable visits to the pediatrician as a child.  Patients at the hospital were rarely friendly and usually unwelcoming or difficult to deal with.  This, though, did not discourage my desire to become a physician, but it actually strengthened it.  I saw that the physicians got so much gratification from caring for patients, even though most people would consider the circumstances to be very unpleasant.  I knew then that I wanted to do this as my profession.  There are many careers in which a person can help others, but medicine is one of only a few that one can give help as important as improving another's health. \tIn the past few years, I became slightly worried that I chose to pursue a career in medicine only because of an initial interest in biology and the perception that people who are good at science in school go on to become doctors.  I knew that I had thoroughly explored the medical profession, that I would be well suited for it, and that it would lead to a very rewarding career.  However, I never seriously considered any other options, and I feared that there might have possibly been better alternatives.  In my freshman year, my attraction toward calculus and physics led me to consider a career in engineering.  After taking two calculus courses, I quickly realized that although I enjoy learning math, I do not want it to be a major part of my life after school.  I was then satisfied that choosing to be a pre-medical major was the correct decision.  Then, in my sophomore year, I became incredibly interested in organic chemistry.  I found it to be enjoyable, and I seemed to be talented at it.  This was the closest I came to abandoning the goal of medicine.  I talked frequently with one of my professors about careers in organic chemistry, and in my junior year, I even added a chemical science major so that I could start a synthetic organic chemistry research project.  However, I soon became uninterested in the lab work, and I learned that I like the subject in the classroom, but I could never have a career in organic chemistry. \tAfter eliminating math and chemistry, I knew that my career would be related to biology.  In all the time that I had considered other careers, I always felt very strongly that medicine was a great option, but I never thought about other professions in biology.  I had always enjoyed the subject, and with amazing science I learned in each upper level biology course, I became more attracted to a career in research.  So at the start of my junior year, I got a job working in a research lab.  This was very helpful for me, because my experiences there led me to decide that biomedical research would be an excellent career for me.  So by the end of my third year of college, I had narrowed my career options down to two, closely related fields.  In both clinical medicine and biomedical research, I have no doubt that I would not only have an enjoyable, satisfying career, but I would also be a valuable asset.  But in order for me to get maximum satisfaction, I will need to be involved in both sides of medicine, instead of having to choose one over the other. \tIt could be said that my calling for medicine came at a relatively young age, as I had always been attracted to it and all of my experiences in the profession only strengthened its appeal.  However, in the past few years, I have done a lot of thinking and exploring other options, and I am glad that I did so.  I learned that although I enjoy several other subject areas, only medicine could offer me an exciting career in which I get the pleasure and feeling of significance that comes from helping the ill through direct care and research.  Due to my interest in and desire to be involved with both of these major facets of medicine, I have decided to pursue both careers in the form of the M.D./Ph.D. combined degree program. Xavier University Freshman Biology Award At the end of my freshman year of college, I was given the award of Freshman Biology Student of the Year for performance in biology lecture and lab courses., Pre Med Society I am a member of Xavier University's Pre Med Society.  Activities through this group include volunteering time to Good Samaritan Hospital, organizing a volunteer disaster readiness team for Tri Health, and listening to talks by various medical professionals.  The disaster readiness team is a group of students who have volunteered to be ready to assist two local hospitals if there is an emergency.  This would primarily involve moving patients and equipment., Help Build Hope I became involved in a project called Help Build Hope through a local church, and it was also affiliated with Habitat for Humanity.  The project was a one-day mass construction of houses for Hurricane Katrina relief.  Volunteers spent the day building different pieces of houses that were shipped and put together on the gulf coast.  I volunteered in the project and also helped  organize the involvement of Xavier University's Habitat for Humanity., Organic Chemistry Recognition I was recognized for my perfomance on the American Chemical Society organic chemistry exam at the end of my second semester of organic chemistry.  I got the highest score on the test since it has been given at Xavier., Research Laboratory Aide In my time working in the lab, I have done a wide variety of things.  I am responsible for maintaining supplies and reagents in the lab.  I have also been able to learn a lot of new, valuable techniques in helping the investigators with their projects.  This first-hand look at the research world is what prompted me to pursue a career in medical research., Chapter of Organic Chemistry Book In the spring of my junior year, my organic chemisty professor gave me the opportunity to write a chapter of book about organic chemistry name reactions.  The chapter is about the Cope rearrangement, and I am currently still writing it.  The book is scheduled to be published in 2008., Physician Job Shadowing In the summers before my freshman, sophomore, and junior years of high school, I sometimes spent days shadowing an internist at a local hospital.  This gave me my most valuable experiences in clinical medicine, Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship In this program, I worked my own research project for three months.  With the help of my supervisor, I planned and executed experiments to study the function of a mutant protein believed to be responsible for a disease phenotype.  My experiments included cell culture transfections, assays, and western blotting.  I also had to organize and prepare data for a presentation and a poster.  This was a very valuable experience, because although I had already been working in a lab for awhile, it was the first project that I was essentially solely responsible for., Peer Science Tutor Since my sophomore year of college, I have been working as tutor at Xavier's Learning Assistance Center, which provides free tutoring services to all students.  I tutor fellow students one-on-one in biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and math.  Since August 2006 I have also been the leader of an organic chemistry study group.  This group meets weekly, and I am responsible for facilitating group learning and problem solving."

    "text": "A love for science; the gift of caring; an unwavering determination-These qualities, among others, are of a unique subset of attributes I consider to make up a successful physician.  Initially, my personal desire to pursue medicine began as a fascination for science.  At a young age I became intrigued with the inner workings of the human organ systems.  My fascination was triggered by several assignments in the third grade, then flourished at the local library where I would read science books covering many different fields including physiology, anatomy, and immunology.  At that point, I realized that my life's work had to revolve around my passion for the sciences. \t My captivation with biology laid the groundwork for the years to follow.  As time passed I thought about my personal qualities and attributes and how they might shape me to become a caring physician.  I realized that I posses unique experiences that influenced my decision to pursue medicine.  In looking back at my childhood, I truly appreciate how it opened my eyes to the realities of the world.  My determination to become a physician was greatly influenced by my parent's jarring road to success.  At a time when Iran was experiencing great inner turmoil, my mother and father left their homes for the United States in hopes of a successful future otherwise not foreseen in their current circumstance.  At a vulnerable point in their lives, their survival in the United States was reliant on their sheer will to succeed and aided by the generosity of others.  My parents' struggle to build a life from scratch infused within me a belief in the moral benefit of honest work as well as its ability to develop character.  Their stories of how strangers helped them hurdle various obstacles in their lives gave me an everlasting understanding of the impact a simple helping hand can have on someone's life.  Altogether, these experiences have created a passion and drive within me to help others overcome limitations as my parents once endured.  The experiences throughout my life have taught me that everything happens for a reason.  My childhood implanted within me a passion for service, which blossomed even further as I matured in faith.  I believe all individuals are created in a distinctly unique way and are endowed with a variety of passions, desires and gifts.  In the process of growing up, I've discovered that God not only wired me with a love for the sciences but also blessed me with the gift of caring.  Cultivated within me is an inherent desire to make a difference and help those in need.  My heart beats to help those that are neglected and yearning for someone to see their inner potential.  Many of my aspirations are rooted in my desire to utilize healthcare as a tool to heal wounds both physically and spiritually.  In the future, I hope to expand the mission of various healthcare outreach programs to not only provide healthcare, but also to help socially reconstruct the relationship between opposing sects throughout the world.  I feel that great strides can be taken toward mending relationships of opposing peoples by using medical care as the catalyst.   While attending The Ohio State University my innate curiosity for basic science led me to pursue various research opportunities.  Through my involvement in different laboratories, I've gained an awareness and understanding for the importance of research on multiple levels.  While currently studying under Dr. Chandan Sen at The Ohio State University Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute I fully realize that rapid progress towards original medical innovation is contingent on fundamental research.  This realization has helped me grasp the importance of continued research involvement throughout my career, both to become a well-rounded, knowledgeable physician and most importantly to better treat my patients.  My current area of research involves understanding the mechanisms and pathways that allow cardiac fibroblasts to sense hyperoxic conditions and differentiate into myofibroblasts.  In understanding this cascade of events I hope for my research to contribute in creating a variety of avenues for decreasing post-surgery cardiac dysfunction.  I look forward to the opportunity to continue my research throughout medical school and as a future collaborator.  In conclusion, the most important reason for why I want to pursue medicine is that it is who I am.  At a certain point, after working so hard for a particular goal it becomes your destiny.  I stay strong in the belief that hard honest work and the adherence to moral and ethical principles is the sole path toward successfully accomplishing my goals.  Along with my passion for science and humanity, my preparation, work ethic, desire and faith have given me both the self-assurance to know that I am meant to become a doctor and the determination to not waver in my pursuit of achieving this goal. Adopt-A-School Volunteer Tutor Adopt-A-School is a student organization at The Ohio State University in which its volunteers tutor students at Indianola Middle School in conjunction with Hilliard CARES. As a tutor, I helped the students with their studies, primarily in 5th grade science, and served as a mentor in a structured environment., Alpha Epsilon Delta National Member Alpha Epsilon Delta is a premedical honor society that serves to stimulate an appreciation of the importance of premedical education; to promote communication between medical and premedical students and educators; and to use its resources to benefit health organizations, charities and the community.  My involvement with this organization gave me great insight into a future within the medical field.  A couple of my experiences included opportunities to regularly volunteer at Children's Hospital and the ability to engage in ethical discussions with practicing physicians., Golden Key International Honour Society Golden Key is an academic honour society which recognizes and encourages scholastic achievement and excellence among college and university students from all academic disciplines.  Membership to the organization is by invitation only, to the top 15% of juniors and seniors.  The primary mission of the society is to enable members to realize their potential by connecting individual achievement with service and lifelong opportunity., Helix/Tri-Beta: Membership Chair Helix/Tri-Beta is The Ohio State University's nationally affiliated biological sciences honorary.  I served a two year term as the Membership Chair of Helix/Tri-Beta.  The organization is dedicated to improving the understanding and appreciation of the various fields of the biological sciences as well as to provide scientific research opportunities.  Helix/Tri-Beta also participates in a variety of service events to show their ongoing devotion to better the community., Post Graduation Research: Dr. Chandan Sen Lab I currently work under Dr. Chandan Sen at the Ohio State University Medical Center Department of Surgery as a full time research assistant.  The laboratory focuses on the study of oxygen, reactive oxygen species and antioxidant nutrients with an emphasis on tissue injury and repair.  My work primarily involves understanding the mechanisms and pathways in which cardiac fibroblasts sense oxygen and differentiate into myofibroblasts. A key trigger of cardiac fibroblast differentiation is myocardial ischemia-reperfusion.  A consequence of cardiac fibroblast differentiation is the over production of collagen and extracellular matrix resulting in cardiac fibrosis, which is associated with myocardial stiffening and heart failure.  By fully understanding the cascade of events that is occurring during cell differentiation, I hope my research will have implications in creating avenues for decreasing post-surgery cardiac dysfunction., Publication: Cardivascular Research Roy S, Khanna S, Hussain SR, Biswas S, Azad A, Rink C, Gnyawali S, Shilo S, Nuovo GJ, Sen CK. MicroRNA expression in response to murine myocardial infarction: miR-21 regulates fibroblast MMP2 via PTEN. Cardiovascular Research 82:21--29; 2009.  This publication has given me a comprehensive understanding of the work that goes into each paper.  I am very proud of this particular publication because of the significance of this innovative field of microRNA in ischemia research.  It was also acknowledged with an editorial published within the same journal edition.  I provided extensive data pertaining to miR-21's regulatory abilities within cardiac fibroblasts.  Specifically, I was able to show that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a direct target of miR-21 and that modulation of this microRNA regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteases 2 (MMP-2) via a PTEN pathway.   In conjunction with this publication, working in a research environment has taught me that although obstacles are often times inevitable, the only way to surpass them is with an honest work ethic and persistence.  As a whole, the opportunity to study under Dr. Sen has given me an in-depth understanding and appreciation for fundamental research as well as a desire for continued involvement throughout my career., Biological Sciences Scholar of the Year The Biological Sciences Scholars Program is one of thirteen programs within The Ohio State Scholars Program.  Each year a single student having displayed a positive influence in the community as well as strong academics is selected within each program as a representative.  Their profile is then displayed on the honors and scholars website along with a brief description of their experience for review by others who are considering applying for admittance into the program.  I was nominated as the Biological Sciences Scholar of the Year for the 2005-2006 school year., Undergraduate Research: Dr. Erich Grotewold Lab The Grotewold lab is involved in interdisciplinary research including biochemistry, molecular biology, cellular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics.  As a research aide I had the opportunity to acquire extensive knowledge in each of these fields as well as provide research support for the ongoing projects within the lab.  I was able to conduct experiments to understand the functions of several transcription factors within the maize genome; specifically IF-35, RIF1 and zmbHLH5.  Additionally, I studied the protein-protein interactions of several Arabidopsis gene products., Grace Clinic Volunteer The mission of Grace Clinic is to love God and love people and to use medicine as a vehicle to share God's word.  The volunteer physicians and staff strive to provide quality medical care to those who would otherwise not have access to it.  The patient's illness is addressed by considering physical, spiritual, emotional, mental, and social needs.  My experience has generally consisted of providing a helping hand with the setup and disassembly of the clinic as well as to offer assistance in the pharmacy and other areas as needed.  As opportunities arise, I am also able to shadow physicians and learn from their interactions and teachings.  Grace Clinic has given me the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of individuals strengthening my ability to communicate with a variety of people from varying cultural backgrounds., Biological Sciences Scholar The Ohio State Scholars program offers academically motivated students the chance to meet and live with other students who share similar interests and career goals.  There are thirteen programs centered on a particular theme or area of study designed to complement their academic experience with a variety of opportunities to learn outside of the classroom.  The Biological Sciences Scholars Program is a four year program focusing on the exposure to undergraduate research in the biological sciences., Minority Affairs Organic Chemistry Tutor The OMA Tutoring Program was established to assist minority students at The Ohio State University with enhancing and enriching their academic skills.  Specifically, I tutored Organic Chemistry 251 students several times per week.  A majority of my tutoring consisted of assisting students with recommended homework as well as helping them to better understand concepts within the focus of the class., Physicians Free Clinic Volunteer The Physicians Free Clinic (PFC), an affiliate organization of the Columbus Medical Association, is the largest provider of free episodic and specialty heath care in Franklin County.  During my experience with Physicians Free Clinic I have been volunteering as an exam room filler.  This position requires that I familiarize myself with the scheduling board, patient files and physician supplies.  I also help with the upkeep of the clinic and review patient files for any extenuating conditions that require immediate attention.  This experience has given me insight into doctor-patient interaction, especially in sensitive scenarios.  Additionally, this experience has strengthened my ability to communicate in a medical environment with not only patients but physicians as well., Meals On Wheels Volunteer Volunteering for LifeCare Alliance has allowed me the opportunity to deliver meals to homebound adults and chronically ill persons.  Delivering meals allows these individuals the ability to remain in an independent living environment.  Often, I was able to spend small amounts of time sharing a conversation and interacting with each person.  This opportunity not only allowed me to provide a service to my community but also strengthened my ability to communicate with a diverse range of individuals., Wonders of Our World Volunteer W.O.W. is a program which teaches basic concepts of the physical and biological sciences through hands-on elementary-level experiments.  There are a series of six workshops, each focusing on a different concept, offered to classroom teachers throughout the year.

They are lifelong learners, family members, and friends. Their maturity is self evident in the respect with which they treat others. They are nurses, lawyers, teachers, plumbers, engineers, and more. But the most imaginative of them, the ones that have touched me in the deepest way, are doctors. Their ability to connect with others -- my own connectedness with the human race -- is my most compelling reason to seek a career in medicine.  I expect that many personal statements you read will reference sympathy or empathy, both essential qualities that I possess. The idea is that doctors who can relate to their patients' emotional states are better able to care for and comfort them. However it is also said that doctors must exercise clinical detachment in order to select the treatment option with the highest utility. This begets a paradox: if the doctor is emotionally conflated with the patient then he might make a rash treatment decision, but if the doctor is emotionally detached from the patient then he will be unable to evaluate the utility the patient will derive from his decision.  I said that I share connectedness with other human beings, and the bi-directionality of this statement is very much intended. A doctor wants to alleviate the patient's suffering by making him better, and the patient wants to please the doctor by getting better. So, ironically, openly caring about the patient can   induce performance stress. On the other hand, acting detached can make the patient despondent and anxious. The most equanimous arrangement is for the doctor to support the patient unconditionally; to interact with the patient as a friend, but to make decisions as a professional.  I think we all tend to judge other people even though we wouldn't wish to be judged ourselves. We think, If that patient watched his diet a little better, if he got a little more exercise, then he wouldn't be in the mess he's in now. And yet I know few doctors who always eat healthy and work out. The key is to inform the patient professionally that he needs to lose weight, yet at the same time convey personally that you accept the patient the way he is. To appreciate the necessity of this mode of interaction -- that's connecting with the patient!  The ability to connect with others is an asset in any profession, but its use is most profound in medicine. Medical school will do more than give me the technical knowledge to treat patients. It will allow me to practice and hone my interpersonal skills, and then use them to their fullest potential throughout life. I'm not ready to face a dying patient just yet, but under the mentorship of your institution I will learn to do so with compassion and serenity.  Connectedness is not my only reason to pursue a career in medicine. The pay is good and the job offers stability, which is especially appealing to someone like me who plans to start a family. There's also the excitement of an ever evolving challenge, the pleasure of working with highly professional peers, the immediate gratification of knowing I've made a difference to someone, and the respect and independence the title of Doctor commands in our society. Moreover there's the opportunity to contribute to an endeavor much, much larger than myself, and there's the self fulfillment that comes from it.  I think a purely selfless desire to serve others is a foolish reason to apply to medical school that will lead to burnout later on. I am in awe of the human condition, and I possess an unrelenting drive to improve it. I have found my past medical experiences stimulating and exciting, and I am confident in my ability to learn and adapt. Medicine is bound for a future that neither of us can fathom, and I am ready to be there when it arrives. Mitra Lab A paid part-time position at Washington University School of Medicine's Department of Genetics' Mitra Lab. Among other topics, the lab researches novel development and applications of polony sequencing: a new technique for genome sequencing that is 100 fold faster and less expensive than conventional techniques derived from the Sanger Dideoxy Method.  Myself and another undergraduate maintain and program the robotic hardware that executes the polony sequencing protocols. We work with graduate students and professors in the lab to customize the design and programming of the hardware to new applications. Our work gives us hands-on experience with electronics, flow systems, benchtop chemistry, and computerized optical microscopes; and with softwares such as Matlab, C, and Ruby.  Working with Rob Mitra and the many other knowledgeable people in the lab has given me the opportunity to gain experience in areas outside my job description. I have also learned about microbiology, bioinformatics, and most importantly, professional decorum., Beaumont Scout Reservation Beaumont Scout Reservation is boy scout camp in Ashtabula County, Ohio. Boy scouts between the ages of 11 and 18 camp out for a week at a time and participate in daily activities to learn new skills and earn merit badges and rank advancements. I spent three summers teaching scouting skills such as knot tying, fire building, shelter building, cooking, how to purify water, and how to use a compass and map to navigate., Physics Tutoring Cornerstone is on on-campus academic resource center at my university. Its academic mentoring program employs students who have previously done well in a course to mentor (tutor) other students in that course. Only select 100/200 level courses are covered by the program.  I was referred to the program by my physics professor, Tom Bernatowicz, after completing his introductory physics course in the spring of 2005. Since then, I have tutored groups of 2-6 students for two hours a week in Newtown's Laws, Special Relativity, Electromagnetism, (Introductory) Quantum Mechanics, and Thermodynamics. Ironically, most of my students have been premedical juniors and seniors., Cleveland Clinic Research Project In May of 2006 I began a research project at the Cleveland Clinic under the direction of Manikum Moodley, MBChB, FCP, FRCP. The project is a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients admitted to the clinic with acute flaccid paralysis between 1980 and 2005 to find prognostic markers for the disease.  I have worked on the project over the summer of 2006, over the 2006-2007 intersession break, and presently during the summer of 2007. I have now finished a comprehensive review of 41 patient charts and a preliminary statistical analysis of the collected data. I am presently working on a more detailed analysis in preparation for authoring a paper on the subject.  I have also had the opportunity to attend grand rounds, attend neurology conferences at the Cleveland Clinic, and observe the exams of a few pediatric neurology patients., Nursing Home Internship Montefiore is an old age home situated in Beachwood, a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. The facility provides nursing care and assisted living and includes a rehabilitation wing, a dementia wing, and a hospice wing. Adult and youth volunteers help the paid staff by visiting residents, transporting residents to activities, assisting residents at activities, helping out in the kitchen, and even helping the administrative staff with office work.  My position was formally known as the Cadkin Youth Leadership Intern (named after the sponsors). My responsibilities included recruiting youth volunteers, training them to interact with residents, and pairing them with residents or other activity staff. This necessitated visiting residents myself and attending resident-led meetings to ascertain which residents would benefit most from visitation, as well as collaborating with the staff to find out what activities could best utilize volunteers.  I was not involved in the clinical care of any of the residents.  During my spare time over the course of the internship I wrote a computer program that the full-time staff now use to keep track of the youth volunteers., Eagle Scout My advancement to the rank of Eagle Scout represents the culmination of my experience as a Boy Scout. In all I earned 36 merit badges, three palms, held multiple leadership positions within my troop, and volunteered hundreds of service hours at local food banks, animal shelters, nursing homes, schools, and cultural gardens -- all before graduating high school.  For my eagle project I designed and oversaw the construction of Montefiore's first wheelchair accessible garden. Montefiore is a nursing home in Beachwood, Ohio., Ophthalmology Shadowing My high school allows seniors to take 3-5 weeks off of classes for a Senior Search, an academic project that explores career opportunities. I spent three weeks with William Reinhart, MD, Professor of ophthalmology at Case Western Reserve University and at the University Hospitals Residency Program, director of the Cleveland Eye Bank, and diplomate of the American Board of Ophthalmology. I observed all of his patient exams and surgeries during that time and completed a small project on the risk factors and diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma., City of Beachwood The City of Beachwood, Ohio is a suburb of Cleveland with a population of 11,535. In the spring of 2004, the offices of several departments were moved from City Hall, which was in the process of being replaced by a larger municipal complex, to a temporary location. I was hired to assist the resident Information Technology (IT) staffer with the increased workload brought on by the move.  During my stay I repaired and upgraded computers, improved the network infrastructure, and demonstrated a new, more efficient backup technique. Some of the computers I worked on belonged to the mayor, the fire department, and the police department., Tinnerman Wilderness Canoe Base Tinnerman is a canoe base in Ontario, Canada's French River Wilderness Reservation. It is owned by the Greater Cleveland Council, Boy Scouts of America. The nearest major city is Sudbury. Boy scouts from across the United States attend to go on week-long canoe treks of 80 kilometers or more.  Tinnerman had a shortage of guides the summer of 2003 so I took the opportunity to help out. For three weeks, I guided groups of eight adults and youth on canoe treks of the French River. I also taught scouts how to use a canoe, navigate, set up a camp, and cook food., Working So Animals Get Support Working So Animals Get Support (WAGS) is a student-lead service group sponsored by my campus YMCA. WAGS volunteers wash, walk, and socialize animals at local shelters. The group also fundraises at St. Louis's annual Canine Carnival and by putting on an annual community dog wash.  I joined WAGS shortly after its inception to satisfy doggy urges resultant from the absence of my own pooch at college. I took a break from WAGS over the 2006-2007 academic year, but hope to rejoin in 2007-2008, time permitting."

    "text": "I felt like my life had been snatched away. I was fine just a few days earlier.  I had been dining with friends, reading, and enjoying college life.  Soon after, I was isolated in a hospital room and wearing a surgical mask.  A severe migraine, stiff neck, and achy back were just some of the symptoms.  I had been waiting for over an hour before admission.  My body was in excruciating pain.  Previously, I had observed a wide array of life-threatening emergencies, but nothing seemed so terrifying as this.  Finally, after completing the necessary paperwork and providing proof of insurance, the process of treatment began.  The sounds of intravenous therapy as drugs were quickly administered are still clear to me.  Within a matter of days, I had become accustomed to the routine of my treatment.  My body and mind seemed to know the exact hour the nurse and phlebotomist would visit.  The therapy had become unbearable.  I was unable to sleep, my vision was blurred, and I had become depressed.    Though the treatment was difficult, I will never forget Ms. Kay, the nurse assigned to me.  She took care and skill with every technique and her touch was light, gentle, and healing.  She smiled with every word, never failing to comfort me.  Her gift of healing truly eased the pain. During my weeklong stay, I wondered if I wanted to work in such a cold and sterile place.  But then I thought of Ms. Kay and the need for more compassionate health professionals.  What would I have done with out her  I once considered health professionals to be impersonal, lacking interest in getting to know their patients.  My interaction with Ms. Kay had completely changed this perception.  Although she gave me painful, daily injections of heparin, she often shared personal stories and told jokes.  She exemplified compassion and skillful care, qualities I strive to possess as a future physician.  After enduring one week of treatment for aseptic meningitis, I now know what it is like to be a seriously ill patient.  I realized how illness and treatment could take a toll on one's life. I also learned the importance of sound physical and mental health.   Two weeks after being discharged, in addition to getting back on track with school, I was bombarded with mail.  Enclosed were long lists of pricy medications and procedures received at the hospital.  I owed the hospital over $20,000.00.  I knew that health care was expensive, but I never imagined a bill so costly.  Fortunately, I had health insurance, but even with this form of assistance my parents are still paying the medical bill.  As a result of this experience, I further recognize the right to health insurance for all people and the need for health care reform.  I have also observed how the business side of health care may prevent patients from receiving quality medical care and necessary treatment.    Influenced by this experience, I envision my role as a physician to include working with underserved populations.  I find this to be necessary because many Americans lack health care.  As a future physician, I plan to be directly involved in the community.  For example, I will contribute to health fairs or other community events by educating groups on health and wellness topics focusing on preventative care.  I believe that direct contact with communities will encourage members to become more proactive and will help to alleviate health disparities.  I also believe that the involvement of more physicians from diverse backgrounds will change the way in which certain groups view health.   As a result of my treatment for aseptic meningitis, I have witnessed first hand, how illness can truly affect the patient. I know that I will have the ability to relate to future patients, empowering them with the knowledge to make sound medical decisions regarding their health.

    "text": "We have a GSW with a chest wound coming in, the nurse at the triage desk alerts the staff as she receives the call from the paramedics. My dad, an army trained respiratory therapist on staff, explains to me that a GSW stands for a gunshot wound, and this could be very serious since it is a chest wound and it could damage the heart. Five minutes later, the paramedics rush in while performing CPR and my dad and the rest of the staff rushed into the trauma room to save this young man's life. Ten minutes later, the staff that had just entered the trauma room in a hurry walked out with a dejected and solemn look on their faces. I asked my dad what happened in there, and he explained to me that the patient died, and was probably dead before he got there. This was my initial exposure to medicine. My mother had suggested that I volunteer at John Peter Smith hospital, instead of sitting at home watching television all day. I agreed and that day happened to be my first day on the job. During my fourteen years leading up to that point in my life, I already had my life goals set. I loved math and physics so I planned to be an aerospace engineer working for NASA and eventually being able to enter space. The instant that I saw the intensity and hard work that those physicians in the emergency room put into saving that young man's life, I knew this was the profession meant for me.   My whole life I have been around role models who have helped shape my desire to be in a career to help people. My mother is my biggest role model in that category. Her being a single parent while my dad was stationed in various cities, called for me to attend work with her for different days of my life. She is a social worker and always went out of her way to help different people find jobs. Often she would find jobs for people that would make two to three times the amount of money as her. I really couldn't understand how we were living poor and she was helping people of her same caliber find jobs that paid so much more. She told me that when you help people everyday, there is no amount of money that can replace the joy of seeing that person succeed and do well in life. She always said that whatever you do, make it a point to help someone and you will never tire of your job, no matter the compensation. I didn't really understand that statement until my second year of volunteering at John Peter Smith. I was assigned to the NICU and my job consisted of answering phones and helping the nurses with anything they needed. Many times I would see tiny little babies come in and out and more often than not, about half of the infants would die. I would sometimes be so sad not only for the child but for the families of the child. Many of the neonatologists would work long nights caring for these small infants and the next day the infant would die. I asked the physician on duty how could he bear working all these hours, sacrificing family and fun for these infants who were barely hanging on to life. The doctor told me no matter how many infants die, the opportunity to save one is what makes this job worthwhile. Seeing how excited the families would be when the physician would tell them their child could go home, helped me understand this theory and what my mom was truly trying to relay to me. This experience reaffirmed my position to become a doctor.   After those volunteering experiences, I was eager to learn more about the profession and my motivation increased immensely which translated into my coursework. My grades for the rest of my high school career increased and it continued through college. While in college, I wanted to know more about how research and medicine interacted with each other, so I applied for a position in the University of Cincinnati SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship) program. I had the pleasure of working with Drs. Herbert and Finkelman. This experience was hard, but a rewarding one due to the fact that I was truly able to see how research impacts the lives of common people and how physicians are greatly assisted by research. While in SURF, I had the opportunity of shadowing Dr. Martin, a general surgery resident at the university. He would have me wake up early in the morning and take me through the whole day of a surgeon, which included morning rounds followed by procedures and ending with rounds again. This experience was beneficial because I was able to get a true feel for the life of a doctor.   By experiencing the different avenues of healthcare throughout my life I have confidence to know that I am choosing the right profession. I have seen the death and I have seen the joy, I have seen the long hours and the hard work that these physicians put into helping others and I know that this is what I want to do. My mother and father have given me the example of how to help others and through this profession I hope to carry out the same values that they have instilled within me. Who's Who Among American College Students Award for being top 10% of students within their respective college., Dean's List Dean's List Fall 2006, 2007, 2008; Spring 2008, 2009; Honor Roll Spring 2007, University of Cincinnati SURF program During the summer of 2008, I had the opportunity to work in the Fred Finkelman lab under the tutelage of Dr. Debroski Herbert.

    "text": "I'll have a Balvenie Doublewood, neat, with two cubes, Regis Philbin clamored as he sat down at my bar.  I could not help but notice the visible age on his face that was usually hidden under a mask of stage makeup, the result of a long career under fluorescent studio lighting.  As I began rummaging through the single malt scotches, I could not help but stifle a grin. When I took the job as a bartender at the Cricket Lounge, an upscale martini lounge in downtown Cincinnati, I had never dreamed that many of the skills I would come to obtain would have so much relevance to the practice of medicine.  Although not immediately apparent, success as both a bartender and a physician is the result of mastery of a similar skill set, one that focuses on interpersonal relationships, staying calm under pressure, and teamwork.        It is essential that both a bartender and physician be able to relate and empathize with others, be they patrons or patients.  As a bartender, I have had the opportunity to talk to people from all backgrounds with all sorts of problems, ranging from lawyers anxious about upcoming legal battles to dishwashers worried about making next month's rent.  The bar has taught me to listen to people's problems, carefully consider possible actions, and counsel my patrons on a healthy course of action, a process similar to that which  I will have to go through time and time again in clinic as a physician.  Working one-on-one with a patient to solve problems, whether medical or personal, is something I am sure I will always enjoy as a physician.  The enjoyment I experience as a result of such counseling sessions has reinforced my desire to pursue medicine as a career.        On a busy Friday night, things at the bar can quickly get out of control, as patrons shout orders from all sides of the bar and cocktail waitresses grow impatient at the service bar.  Amid the chaos, it becomes the job of the bartender to take control of the situation, prioritize the jobs at hand, and act in an elegant, focused manner to ensure the bar continues to function smoothly. This process is not dissimilar to how a physician must react when a patient codes on the floor.  The bar has taught me firsthand how to take charge in such situations, and further, that I enjoy the challenge of trying to balance so many tasks at once.  The leadership skills I have acquired at the bar will prove invaluable as I pursue medicine, as there will inevitably come a time when a hectic situation arises and my ability to stay calm under pressure will be directly responsible for the well-being of a patient.  The daily, unexpected challenges that are associated with a career in medicine are one of the main reasons I chose to pursue the field.      For the bar to run successfully, it is essential that I work well with my co-workers. My colleagues come from all backgrounds, ethnicities, and social statuses, as they undoubtedly will in the field of medicine.  From the fiery cocktail waitresses that man the floor to the tattoo-clad line cooks that work behind the scenes, my interactions with those around me determine how efficiently the bar will run.  Similarly, as a physician, I will have to be able to work with all varieties of doctors, nurses, and technicians to ensure an ideal outcome for my patients.  A large part of practicing medicine is interacting with other healthcare professionals.  While improper communication at the bar may result in unsatisfactory service, similar communication lapses in medicine could potentially have disastrous results for my patients.  By allowing me to improve these skills before beginning a career in medicine, the bar has ensured that my future patients will receive the best possible care as the result of stellar teamwork.      When I started as a bartender, I never dreamed that the job I took to help pay the rent would have such a meaningful impact on my decision to become a physician. As I approach each patron, I find myself excited to learn their story, listen to their problems, and do my best to lend a helping hand.  For this reason, I look forward to being a physician and applying many of the skills I have developed slinging drinks late into the night. Bartender As a bartender at the Cricket Lounge in downtown Cincinnati, I am responsible for making cocktails and martinis for both lounge patrons and guests in our sister four-star restaurant, the Palace.  Apart from concocting drinks, I am also responsible for stocking the bar, taking care of the cash register, and communicating with cocktail waitresses and cooks., SI Leader for Anatomy and Physiology As a supplemental instructor for the Anatomy and Physiology sequence, I created lesson plans and taught two weekly review sessions covering material from lecture.  My sessions focused on physiology, and consisted of lectures on class material and small group work.  My patience and communication skills were also tested as I fielded questions from the students and tried to explain my answers in ways that would make the material easier to grasp., Research Assistant I worked full-time in a lab that was working to develop a method to perform fetal cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.  Using a sheep model, I conducted open-heart surgery on first-trimester sheep fetuses within the pregnant ewe.  I was responsible for a large portion of the surgery, including surgical cutdown, cannulation of the major fetal vessels, operation of the bypass pump, and closure of the wound.  While in the lab, I also helped develop a rat model for HLHS, an often fatal newborn disease where the left ventricle of the heart does not develop, and conducted clinical research studying the gender differences in the manifestation of the disease., College Honors and Recognitions Since I began my career at the University of Cincinnati, I have been on Dean's list every quarter that I have not been on co-op.  My academic success has recently been rewarded with a SEEBME scholarship, an award that is given to biomedical engineers that display academic excellence.  Additionally, as a sophomore, I entered an essay I wrote about my love of waking up in the morning with a cup of coffee and the newspaper into the undergraduate essay contest and was fortunate enough to place second among all applicants., Research Assistant To begin my research career, I studied the effects of ecstasy and methamphetamine on neonatal brain development using a rat model.  I was responsible for dosing the rodents, running them through a gamut of behavioral tests, including the Cincinnati and Morris water mazes, and collection of brain tissue.  While part of the lab, I also studied the effects of lead and manganese on neonatal brain development utilizing a similar experimental design. This work resulted in a research poster that I presented at two different symposiums., Research Assistant To further my engineering studies, I began working full-time in a lab that studies the fluid dynamics of air flow through the vocal cords. As a researcher in the lab, I helped design and conduct experiments using an airflow visualization technique known as PIV.  This has enabled our lab to become the first in the world capable of visualizing air flow within the glottis during phonation, providing information that has repercussions in airway reconstruction surgery. I also designed and constructed a novel microindenter, which is capable of measuring the Young's modulus of vocal cord tissue in an intact larynx."

    "text": "Is there any caffeine in 'decaf' coffee  I had been pondering this question in science class; my hand shot up for my seventh grade teacher. ... Another question, Gretchen  Yet, I really didn't know the answer until the eighth grade science fair, after I had extracted caffeine from decaffeinated coffee in a college chemistry lab--a productive Saturday afternoon. As it turns out, the professor that helped me organize the project ultimately became a college mentor, and friend after retirement.  My curiosity had led me on an interesting journey....   Curiosity defines my character, and is manifested in every facet of my life--most noticeably in academia.  I am always interested in discovering why things are the way they are. The College of Wooster has therefore been refreshing because questioning is encouraged. Chemistry, in particular, captivates me because it addresses these why questions by pursuing the fundamental level of molecules--why life works.   I am persistent in discovering these truths, a persistence driven by curiosity. The most complex questions would often land me in the office of an expert. I can remember sitting with a crusty, college professor, drawing a connection between system equilibria and thermodynamics. Leaning back in his chair with obvious reflection, he smiled and asked are you planning on becoming a chemistry major, because if you're not, it would be a real shame. This was one question that was not hard to answer.  As the subject matter became more complex, so did my questions. This past summer, I studied the effects of two anticoagulants on blood clotting. The research on deep vein thrombosis sparked an interest in me for the blood coagulation cascade. After investigating different aspects of this process throughout a year of biochemistry, I came to question the role of a particular antibody that causes abnormal blood clotting. Thus, for my Independent Study Project, I will investigate the role of phosphatidyl serine, a cell membrane component, in the abnormal blood clotting observed in Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome.   As in chemistry, my interests outside of the classroom have led me to ask questions, pushing me to take each activity to a higher level. I perform on a musical instrument--the harp. I'm told I was curious about this since age eight. Playing in orchestras has been an excellent way to challenge myself, and for curiosity to flourish.   Similarly, development of minute muscle movements, rehearsed by countless hours practicing figure skating each week as a child and young adult, has allowed me to perform motions on the ice that I could only dream of previously, and enabled me to achieve a Gold Medal in the sport. Curiosity, I believe, is the only way I can account for the results. Ask the question, seek the enactment, and do it.  And I believe that my inquisitive nature is what has compelled me toward a career in medicine. Such a career will require questioning, in addition to discipline. There are many unanswered questions medicine will manifest--cures for disease processes, for pain relief, even for blood clotting disorders, still to be found.   I like the questioning aspect that may help to first recognize the problem in a patient, and then seek an answer. I believe my scholastic background, as well as my harp and figure skating disciplines, have prepared me for the field I hope to enter. I like to think of questions. I like to look for answers. However, in medicine, I realize there probably is one thing I may not find a cure for--my curiosity. Medical Assistant For the past four years I have been a summer employee of the Cleveland Endovascular Institute working as a medical assistant, as well as a file and reception coordinator. My primary responsibilities include assisting in vascular procedures, including saphenous vein ablation and phlebectomy, in an outpatient setting. I've become familiar with sterile technique, and assessment for outpatient care and procedures, and have contributed to the designing of organizational protocols to ensure safety and compliance requirements for the program., Community Service Volunteer From junior high school to present, I have played the harp as a service endeavor. I channel my efforts to support volunteer organizations, including Race for the Cure, Care for Quilts Breast Cancer programs, Hope for Honduras, and Rocky River Kiwanis Club. I currently perform for hospital events such as ER opening (St. John West Shore Hospital) and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit opening (Fairview Hospital). I also play at St. Raphael Church Masses. As I play for these events, I am surrounded by people whose sincerity for giving is a reminder of what my own life's decisions should be motivated by., Skating Instructor I am a figure skating instructor at The Alice Noble Ice Arena in Wooster, Ohio. I teach figure skating for the Wooster Skating Academy to school age children, each Saturday. Combining previous experience as a volunteer skating instructor (Winterhurst Junior Club, 2003-2006) with the Wooster Program, I teach the confidence and skills that help aspiring skaters progress., Chemistry Club I have been actively involved in the college Chemistry Club for three years. As a college sophomore, I served as Outreach Coordinator, with the responsibility of planning the Club's service activities. As a junior, I served as Vice President, where my duties were included organization and invitation of speakers and completing the chapter report for review by the American Chemical Society. I have been elected President, where my responsibilities will be to direct all Club activities. Yearly accomplishments of the Chemistry Club have earned it national recognition as a Student Chapter of the American Chemical Society. In order to maintain this status the club must perform qualifying activities, including service, fundraising, speakers, and National Chemistry Week activities, which I am now responsible for organizing. The experience of serving in each position has been a lesson in time management and organization, however, most importantly in communication., Orchestral Harpist I have performed as an orchestral harpist since age fourteen. I acted as principle harpist for Baldwin Wallace College Senior Youth Orchestra for five years. I was selected to play for the Ohio All State Orchestra in 2006, also as the principle harpist. I have continued my harp performance as a member of the Wooster Symphony Orchestra throughout my freshman year of college. Harp performance will likely remain as an avocation throughout my life., Deep Vein Thrombosis Research I participated in research investigating the effectiveness of two anticoagulant drugs--Lovenox and Arixtra--as observed in patients following knee and hip surgery. The study was a prospective randomized comparison of the two drugs, measured according to ten parameters. In addition to follow-up interviews and surgery observation, I evaluated the post-operative symptoms of seventy peri-operative patients. The research introduced my interest for blood clotting disorders, which I continue to investigate through my Independent Study research., Lab Assistant/Chemistry Tutor In the Chemistry Department, I tutor students in General Chemistry and act as a lab assistant for the Organic Chemistry lab. My goal is to help students with the concepts and techniques that I was challenged by, but mastered. My special interest is NMR, and its relationship to MRI; this has been instrumental in teaching lab students, and will contribute to my Independent Study research., Life Guard and Swim Instructor I've worked as a lifeguard and swim instructor at local pools in Cleveland and Bay Village. As a swimming instructor, I've become attuned sequencing mechanisms for safety, which a teaching program requires., Awards/Recognitions John Heil Award. This award is designated for a member of my high school varsity tennis team who best demonstrates the qualities of sportsmanship and leadership. That year, our team attained second place at the State Competition for Ohio (Division I).  Music Scholarship--The College of Wooster. I received one of eight music scholarships offered to incoming students. This was an auditioned competition, based on music performance skills.   Science Scholarship--The College of Wooster. The award was determined by my academic achievements in high school sciences, and is applied to four years at Wooster. This and the Music Scholarship helped me to attend the college I chose for its liberal arts education.   American Chemical Society First Year Award. This award is designated to the student who exhibits outstanding academic achievement in their first year as chemistry student., Figure Skating-Gold Medalist There are eight levels of figure skating, as recognized by the United States Figure Skating Association; advancing to the next level is achieved by passing a test based on flawless execution of specified skills, as determined by a panel of judges. As a junior in high school I achieved the highest level of figure skating recognized by the USFSA--the Gold Medal in Moves in the Field. This accomplishment provides me with the credentials to coach figure skating at reputable skating clubs. This sport has instilled in me a strong sense of tenacity and self-discipline., Hospital Volunteer-Pharmacy While not attending college, I volunteer at my community's University Hospital affiliated pharmacy. My primary responsibility is to transport medication to every wing of the hospital at regular intervals. Additional tasks, such as filing and labeling medication, are performed. I have had the opportunity to become exposed to the organization of a hospital and the importance of the day-to-day activities that essential to a hospital's function."

    "text": "As I will be a first-generation college graduate, who was home-schooled through the ninth grade, talking about medical school never sounded reasonable, let alone feasible.  In fact, it often elicited a pat on the head or an empty good luck.  However, I strongly feel that my unusual educational experiences have prepared me for a rewarding career in medicine and provided a genuine appreciation for formal education.  With hard work and dedication, I have managed to publish a first-author manuscript, independently study for the MCAT, and currently rank number one in my graduating class, all while funding a large portion of my college expenses.  What once seemed a distant childhood fantasy has now become a tangible reality.  I am forever grateful that my parents chose to homeschool my brother and me, despite that it meant becoming a single-income household.  This educational experience taught me from a young age how to learn independently and from sources other than a textbook.  From teaching myself about Ford Mustangs and white-tailed deer to helping my Dad change the oil in our vehicles and going hunting on our 40-acre farm, I was encouraged to seek out information on my own and apply it in everyday activities.  It also taught me what to value in life and that people always come first.  If someone called the house because their vehicle broke down or if someone was rushed to the hospital, we paused class to go and comfort that individual, resuming the lesson later that evening.  All the while, I learned how to interact with a gamut of personalities in various social environments because my parents fostered heavy involvement in church, sports, and other community activities.  In my opinion, this is why I could enter public school in the tenth grade and graduate as both the homecoming king and valedictorian.  My parents knew that they were providing an exceptional environment for both my social and academic development, and although I did not see it at the time, each of these skills is vital to practicing medicine due to its academic rigor and personal nature.  While in high school, selecting a college and beginning my higher education proved to be particularly difficult because no one in my family had experienced the process.  From choosing a major and university to completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and searching for housing, we were lost.  There were many family discussions about meal plans, class schedules, parking, roommates, and more.  But with time and effort, we overcame the hurdles, and I acclimated quickly to my new environment.  Even after starting school in the big city with no Advance Placement (AP) credit and realizing that my pickup truck was out of place, I discovered my love for Starbucks and transitioned well into college.  In the end, I elected to major in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati because of the tremendous co-operative education program (co-op) and the comprehensive curriculum, which provided me with a unique perspective in both clinical and laboratory settings.  Co-op is a mandatory component of the Biomedical Engineering curriculum where the student alternates between work and class in order to gain real-world experience in his or her chosen field.  Although it has led to an extra year of undergraduate study, I have gained relevant work experience and trained myself as a creative problem solver in both industry and research.  Whether it is functionalizing an in vitro assay, figuring out how to tie a release mechanism for an atrial appendage clip and accurately measure its stretch on manufacturing lines, or designing and implementing a translational research project on aortic valve disease, my engineering education has provided me with the intellectual tools, as well as instincts, necessary for problem solving -- another skill vital to practicing medicine.  While my engineering studies have trained me to understand information presented in a textbook, it has also exposed me to the uncertainties of reality.  Textbooks make medicine appear black and white on the surface, but as you zoom in and dig deep, the details become grey as evidenced by biomedical journals.  This captures my curiosity -- where does my knowledge end versus what has science yet to figure out  Likewise, I thoroughly enjoy rounding in the clinic because it makes the nuances of biomedical journals, in addition to textbook facts, colorfully come to life.  Even at the grocery store, I see the biomechanics and regulatory networks at play when people chew gum, shake my hand, or laugh.  Medicine is attractive and captivating to me because I will never run out of ways to challenge myself, use my education, or teach others; nor will I come close to understanding all that it offers -- the learning will never end. Alternative Spring Break Adams Chapel Baptist Church participated in an outreach effort initiated by the Tennessee Baptist Convention, known as God's Plan for Sharing (GPS), in order to witness to every member within the communities of Tennessee.  While there, I helped this small church prepare for GPS by digitally mapping the Dresden community and optimizing resource logistics.  More specifically, I used Microsoft Excel in conjunction with local maps to assemble efficient teams among the local churches, making sure that the entire community could be reached in one day of door-to-door visitation.  After my teams were completed, I taught Pastor Larry Reagan my methods for future endeavors., Flight of Faith Baptist Church As a member of Flight of Faith Baptist church, I regularly attend both Sunday school and the morning worship service.  Additionally, I help with the musical aspect of worship by frequently singing solos, as well as community outreach activities like the Christmas program., Tau Beta Pi Tutoring Chair As a proud member of Tau Beta Pi, I was thrilled to take on the 2011-2012 Tutoring Chair position.  Through this elected office, I managed and staffed the Engineering Learning Center (ELC) which provides tutoring services to the entire engineering student body, particularly to our freshmen in calculus, general chemistry, and physics.  I have been re-elected to continue developing this marvelous program throughout the 2012-2013 academic year., Teaching Assistant As a Teaching Assistant for the course entitled Engineering Concepts (20ENED116), I provide instruction to freshmen engineering students in calculus, general chemistry, and physics.

Freshmen engineering students make up the majority of those who need tutoring, thus there is an emphasis on calculus, general chemistry, and physics., Research: Co-op #3 Continuing in vascular biology, I am completing my final co-op at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in The Heart Institute's division of Molecular Cardiovascular Biology.  Leading a project focused on the role of Notch1 in human aortic valve disease, a problem affecting more than two-percent of the population, I have recently finished the research design.  Now, I have begun to implement my design using a diverse set of lab techniques, including human primary valve cell culture, immunocytochemistry, western blotting, and real-time PCR.  I am also learning about its clinical relevance, along with other cardiac pathologies, as I shadow in the clinic and attend grand rounds., Research: Co-op #1 For my first co-op, I created a new position at the Vontz Center for Molecular Studies researching Tissue Factor (TF), the main trigger of the blood coagulation cascade.  More specifically, I worked with alternatively spliced Tissue Factor (asTF) -- a recently discovered isoform of TF whose properties are still being unraveled.  In the lab, my work consisted of using genetic engineering and molecular biology techniques to produce a recombinant protein and using it in numerous assays, including: RNA extraction, microarray analysis, endothelial cell adhesion, leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, immunohistochemistry, and a scratch assay., Biomedical Device Industry: Co-op #2 For my second co-op, I gained relevant work experience in the biomedical device industry while working at AtriCure, Inc.  As part of a multidisciplinary, product development team, I worked on stroke prevention and cardiac ablation devices in order to advance the treatment of Atrial Fibrillation and its related risk of stroke., Hospital Volunteer For the past three years, I have volunteered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in the Short Stay Unit (2009), Transitional Care Center (2010), and the Liver Transplant Unit (2011).  From playing video and board games, giving Red-Flyer wagon rides down the hallways, and watching movies, to doing crafts and playing trains, I am proud to say that I help to bring smiles to the faces of sick children.  Walking down the hallways is in itself a humbling experience and provides a blunt perspective on reality.  Every week, even if it is only a single silent smile, I am reminded of my innumerable blessings and the privilege of serving those in need., First-Author, Peer Reviewed Publication I am the first author of a peer reviewed publication entitled Non-Proteolytic Properties of Murine Alternatively Spliced Tissue Factor: Implications for Integrin-Mediated Signaling in Murine Models in the journal of Molecular Medicine., American Society of Hematology Travel Award In order to alleviate some of the financial burdens associated with traveling to a conference, I won a nationally competitive travel award through the American Society of Hematology.

    "text": "For a multitude of reasons, twenty-five is a significant birthday for most people. For me, it marked the untimely death of my brother, my heightened awareness of mortality, and the eventual evaluation of myself, my life and my long-term goals. After such a loss, it would have been easy to lose faith in the world around me, but my family provided me with the support I needed to get through this difficult time. Thanks to them, I was reminded that tomorrow is never guaranteed and that I should therefore pursue my dreams. Having witnessed the poor state of education and healthcare in my neighborhood since childhood, I always wanted to be able to have tangible effects on the lives of people, but did not have the confidence to pursue these dreams.  My brother's unfortunate passing served as a catalyst for me to begin the long yet rewarding journey of becoming a physician.  Growing up in the Bronx, New York, I had limited access to professional role models who look or sound like me. As an adolescent, I wanted to be a medical doctor but I seldom saw female physicians or African-American doctors. This realization affected my self-confidence early on, which in turn affected my commitment to the profession during my pre-baccalaureate years. I decided to major in business administrations as a result, an area where there were more role models with whom I could relate.  Over the course of time, my experiences challenged me to develop self awareness and improve confidence in my abilities.  I have honed my strengths and developed personal and professional skills to begin to become the person I have always wanted to be, and to continue my journey towards addressing inequities in healthcare.   In the wake of my brother's sobering passing I took stock of my environment, which was plagued with violence, poverty, and educational and healthcare inequities. My brother died as a result of the violence, and I quickly begun to look for opportunities to begin to make a difference immediately.  Through my participation with Movement Against Childhood Obesity (MAChO), a program at Weill Cornell Medical College, I was able to work with youth in the East Harlem to tackle the growing childhood obesity epidemic.  I also worked with the American Heart Association, where I helped educate underserved communities on ways to maintain healthy heart lifestyles and I relished the opportunity to help people in one of the most essential areas of their lives - health. Founding the Minority Association for Prehealth Students (MAPS) at Lehman College allowed me to gain leadership skills and delight in seeing other underserved students benefit from mentorship and medical education conferences, in order to better achieve their professional goals.  From my personal experiences, I am committed to removing disparities that exist in healthcare today across the board, including improving the number of underserved groups within the profession. While shadowing physicians and surgeons, I discovered the importance of education and communication within healthcare. During this time, patients seemed to turn to me for advice, for help translating Spanish, and several other matters.  I realized through these experiences that patients are also disadvantaged by the lack of physicians who may look or speak like them.  My decision to pursue a medical degree was further invigorated by these experiences.   The need for clinicians who are immersed in practices that enhance the field became increasingly clear to me.  As a preceptor engaged in academic research at the Rusk Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine, I received my introduction to academic research. This experience combined with being a research assistant for 17 months in a cardiovascular physiology lab at Lehman College and also in a molecular genetics lab at Universiteit Maastricht for three months allowed me to experience science at the forefront of medicine and forged my commitment to address some of the medical field's most urgent concerns by conducting clinical trials, implementing new discoveries into practice and evaluating the outcomes of these discoveries. Although I am aware of the difficulties of pursuing a career in patient care, and research, while also having a family and maintaining an active life outside of the hospital, I intend to remain engaged in academic, bench and/or clinical research, in order to apply new knowledge toward treatment, diagnosis, and other medical practices.  As a future doctor, I am committed to improving people's lives through patient advocacy and optimal care, particularly within populations that are medically underserved. When the day comes and I am dressed in my white coat, I hope to inspire youth within my community to follow their dreams with conviction and the confidence of knowing their dreams are attainable. I have personally overcome several obstacles to reach this point, and I appreciate the person that I have become today as a result of these experiences.  I am ready to take on the challenges of the next steps in my journey towards improving the lives of others through medicine.  Administrative, Lehman Teaching and Learning Commons: Mentor, Coach As a STAR mentor, I supervise coaches (tutors) by helping them set goals, manage time, and by providing support for their tutoring sessions. Some of my other responsibilities include planning and leading trainings and workshops and conducting semester reviews and interviews for returning tutors. As a STAR coach, I facilitated tutoring sessions in chemistry and corresponded with students, instructors, and supervisory team frequently to plan sessions. In both roles, I completed e-portfolios to digitally reflect the planning, organization and creativity required to complete each role as well as wrote weekly blogs on approaches to time, communication, process, goals and resources and resiliency., Molecular Genetics Research Abroad: LSAMP Research Assistant As an existing LSAMP research assistant, I was nominated to perform research abroad at an affiliate institution, Maastricht University. Working with PhD candidate Laura Steinbusch, I studied the effects of endosomal pH on substrate uptake and transporter translocation in cardiac myocytes. By reviewing related articles and experimentation, I gained advanced knowledge of cell biology.  During that time, I regularly performed Western blots, Bradford protein determination assays, GLUT4 and CD36 translocation assays, gene knockdown with siRNA, tritium chloroquine assays as well as cultured HL-1 cells. Also a part of my internship was attending journal club and medical presentations., Cardiovascular Physiology Lab: LSAMP Research Assistant As an LSAMP research assistant, I worked with Martin Muntzel, PhD on the effects of obesity on the sympathetic nervous system. We hypothesized that pathophysiologies of obesity (i.e., Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension) are the result of an overstimulated central nervous system. In this lab, I helped design and test a model of diet-induced obesity in rats by conducting high-fat and cafeteria-diet trials. To measure sympathetic nerve activity and vital signs, I aided in telemetry device implantations by preparing the surgical field, the surgical equipment and anestheticizing the subjects. I also provided suturing and dressing wounds post-op, recorded vital signs and monitored weight daily.,  Customer Service, Minority Assoc of Pre-health Students: President, Co-founder Founding my campus' Minority Association for Pre-health Students (MAPS) allowed me to gain an abundance of leadership skills.

    "text": "My mother learned to become nurturing and selfless early on in her life. At the very young age of nine, she lost her mother to kidney failure. Being the oldest girl in the family, she assumed a maternal role for her two younger sisters and older brother out of necessity. From that day on, she adopted the principle with which she has lived her entire life: others before self. My mother took on responsibilities of a much older woman as she cared for her siblings, cooked for them and cleaned up after them. She also frequently helped them with their schoolwork, even as her own grades were slipping due to the tremendous pressures she was experiencing.  This altruistic demeanor continued into motherhood. My mother still has clothes from before her marriage simply because she would rather spend money on her husband and children. She does not pamper or treat herself. She does not take a vacation from her generosity. More importantly, she has made it her mission to instill the value of selflessness into my brother and me. As a result, her outlook on life has become my guiding principle. Because of this, I constantly search for avenues to practice my core belief.   Through my experiences, I quickly found that becoming a physician would provide me such an avenue in overwhelming ways. My first experience with this came on April 11, 1997--the day I became a big sister. Though this was the happiest day of our family's lives, it was slightly marred by the unsettling news we received about the newest addition to our family. My baby brother had cystic hygroma, a congenital disorder that affects the lymphatic system of newborns and can sometimes be fatal. Thankfully, our family was blessed with an incredible pediatric surgeon, Dr. Victor Garcia, who performed a successful surgery to remove my brother's hygroma, allowing him to come home completely healthy. At the time, I considered Dr. Garcia a hero, and his impact on my family ignited an interest in me. This interest slowly developed into passion as the years progressed and as I obtained more exposure to the field of medicine through my volunteering and shadowing experiences.  Because my mother stressed the importance of altruism, I have ensured that I do as much community service as possible. I have found that it gives me a sense of joy that nothing else can. One of the ways I have given back to the community is by volunteering at Bethesda North Hospital in several different positions and departments over the last four years. Out of all of these positions, working in the Intensive Care Unit was the most impactful and significant to me. Part of my job included answering calls from patient rooms and listening to what they needed. I loved this part of my job because I was able to interact with the patients and help them, even if it was in a small way. Many of these patients were worried and scared so I did anything I could to make them a little more comfortable, whether it was bringing them an extra blanket or a cup of ice. Little things like this made a difference, as many of the patients usually thanked me with a smile or even opted to have a simple conversation with me. I enjoyed these few moments I was able to have with the patients tremendously. As much as I love science, biology in particular, doing research in the laboratory could not compare with my experience in the hospital.  However, volunteering alone did not allow me to appreciate what physicians do on a day-to-day basis. Through my shadowing experiences, I learned about the extent of sacrifice medicine involved. I watched Dr. Victor Garcia scarf down his lunch, run from one part of the hospital to another to answer pages, and apologize profusely to his wife on the phone for being late to dinner. I stayed until Dr. Dyatra Mitchell saw her last patient, closed her office for the night, and sent her employees home to their families. But though the lights were off and the shades were drawn, Dr. Mitchell had several hours of work left to do at the office. As I observed these physicians forgo their personal time that they could use to be with their families or even just eat their lunch in peace, I wondered if it was worth it. Was practicing medicine worth the stress, pressure and emotional strain   I got my answer to this question when I saw the relief on the parents' faces of Dr. Garcia's patients after a successful operation. I got my answer when I saw the terrified kids that came in to see Dr. Garcia crack up at one of his silly jokes. I got my answer when I saw Dr. Mitchell's patients sincerely thank her after she reassured them about their condition.  All my life I have searched for ways to fulfill my personal philosophy, others before self. Physicians like Dr. Garcia and Dr. Mitchell have shown me that becoming a doctor more than exceeds this philosophy. They are the epitome of selflessness, and their example has continuously inspired and motivated me. Thanks to them, I have found a path through which I can apply what I have learned from my mother. Hopefully by becoming a physician, I can get one step closer to also becoming as caring and compassionate as Mom. Active membership in Phi Delta Epsilon A year ago, I got accepted into Phi Delta Epsilon, a prestigious medical, professional fraternity. In order to become a member, I had to apply, go through two rounds of interviews and then rush. During the rush period, my fellow pledges and I had to organize a service event and engagement event for the rest of the fraternity. Now that I am a member, I am on the Graduate committee, which organizes guest speakers for the chapter. I also participate in several service events such as fundraisers and the Children Miracle Network banquet. Through Phi Delta Epsilon, I have been able to give back to the community and explore more aspects of medicine., Active membership in AMSA AMSA is a club for pre-medical students that want to know more about the medical field. We organize and participate in several service events each semester. Some of these events include the Run for World Health and the Multiple Sclorosis Walk. We also bring in medical experts to allow members to hear first-hand accounts about medicine. Because of AMSA, I now have a better understanding of the medical field from numerous different perspectives., Shadowing Dr. Mitchell Dr. Dyatra Mitchell is an internist in Mason, OH. During my time with her, I observed her consult with her patients for a variety of different reasons. I also helped the nurse take patients' blood pressure and temperature. In addition, I helped perform tests such as urine tests, EKG readings and pulmonary function tests. Dr. Mitchell often said that internal medicine is the first line of defense in medicine. This is something I quickly discovered when Dr. Mitchell met with patients with everything from high blood pressure to gout to back injuries. And because Dr. Mitchell runs her own practice, I was able to appreciate the stresses, pressures and rewards of this for the first time., Shadowing Experiences in 2010 (Dr. Pisati and Dr. Sai) Dr. Pisati is an internist at the Cheviot Medical Center. During my time with her, I observed patient visits and assisted the nurses in getting patient histories for new patients. Thanks to Dr. Pisati, I learned a little bit more about internal medicine. Dr. Padmaja Sai (386-586-1861) is an oncologist in Palm Coast. I was able to go on rounds with Dr. Sai. Although it was Thanksgiving, Dr. Sai was fully committed to her patients as she monitored their progress, listened to their concerns and made them comfortable. This experience opened my eyes to the sacrifices physicians make. However, Dr. Sai always spoke positively about her job, showing me the importance of passion in medicine., Shadowing Dr. Brown Dr. Rebeccah Brown is a pediatric surgeon at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. During my time shadowing Dr. Brown, I saw several gall bladder removals, an appendectomy, a muscle and skin biopsy, and removal of an umbilical hernia. I also got to see Dr. Brown as she spoke with her patients and their families before and after the surgery. This experience was very unique and interesting because I had never seen a surgery performed before. It exposed me to a new area of medicine I had not previously considered for my potential specialty., Shadowing Dr. Garcia Dr. Victor Garcia is a pediatric surgeon, and the Director of Trauma Services at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. During my time with him, I observed his patient visits and surgeries. I saw him perform removals of skin lesions and hernias. Dr. Garcia is often referred to do pectus excavatum surgeries. Pectus excavatum is an abnormality where the chest wall is sunken in, impairing repiratory and cardiac functions. Typically, metal bars are used to push out the chest wall and are removed after several years. Dr. Garcia met with many children that needed this procedure. He also had a follow-up with a boy who had just gotten the bars in place, and did a surgery to remove the bars in a young girl., Undergraduate Research in Zoology I do undergraduate research in Dr. Paul James' laboratory in the Zoology Department. Dr. James researches the role the alpha4 isoform of sodium-potassium ATPase plays on sperm motility. Usually, I perform polymerase chain reactions, phenol-chloroform extractions, minipreparations, electroporations, and other techniques used in biological laboratories. I have also observed sperm motility assays and mouse dissections. It has been an incredible pleasure to be able to learn so much in the lab. I have truly enjoyed my time participating in this research, and I hope to continue doing research for the rest of my college career and hopefully beyond., Volunteering at Bethesda North Hospital I have volunteered at Bethesda since high school. Two summers ago, I volunteered in the Emergency Room. In this position, I worked with nurses to stock linens and supplies in patient rooms. Last summer, I volunteered in the ICU, a position only offered to pre-medical students. In the ICU, I helped the unit clerk answer phones and patient calls, sort paperwork and make charts. Both summers, I worked three hours a week. I currently volunteer once a month for three hours as a patient escort. Being a volunteer has given me a unique perspective on medicine. I have been able to view the hospital setting at various levels and branches, and interact with patients in a way I have not done previously., Academic Achievements I was on the Dean's List for one semester and the President's List for five semesters at Miami University. I also received honors five times for having a 4.0 GPA. In addition, I am in the University Honors Program, which I was accepted into when I applied to Miami. I have also received a few scholarships from Miami, including Minority Scholarship Fund, Miami Success Award, Ohio Achievement Scholarship and Ohio Merit Scholarship. Also, I was awarded a National Merit Corporate Scholarship from Siemens. I twice received the Parke and Dorothy Smith Scholarship, which is presented to premedical students. Finally, I was granted the Helen W. Donley Scholarship through the Scholar Leader program., Active membership in Indian Student Association (ISA) ISA is a club that allows people to understand and appreciate the Indian culture. Our biggest events are the Diwali show in the fall and Holi week in the spring. The Diwali show consists of numerous dances representing all of the different cultures of India. Throughout my time in ISA, I have participated in the Freshman, South Indian and Bollywood dances. I am also a member of the Starfish Fund committee, our major philanthropic program. The Starfish Fund is an effort to raise money to build a school for the blind in India. To raise money, we have several Indian dinners, which I help organize. I am glad to be a part of ISA because it allows me to keep in touch with my culture., Active membership in Miami MED Miami M.E.D is a selective organization for pre-medical students of high caliber. To become a member of Miami M.E.D., I applied as soon as I was eligible and got selected. In order to learn more about medical school and beyond, members of Miami M.E.D. are offered many opportunities to meet and listen to people with experience in the medical field. We also organize and participate in many service events, including cleaning the local park and hosting a bone marrow drive. Being in Miami M.E.D. has not only helped me gain a better understanding of medicine, but has also allowed me to meet people who have similar interests and passions., Leadership in Oxfam Oxfam is an international organization that fights hunger, poverty and social injustice. Our university's chapter focuses on the issues of hunger, sustainability and fair trade. We hold an annual Hunger Banquet to shed light on the extent of the pandemic and to allow the participants to have a tangible experience with hunger. For our sustainability projects, we put on fundraisers and use the money to buy things like water pumps for an African village or to provide a loan to entrepreneurs in underdeveloped areas. Our biggest project is increasing fair trade awareness across campus and in the community. We do this by organizing events like fair trade coffee tastings and documentary screenings., Leadership and community in Scholar Leader Scholar Leader (SL) is a prestigious program for students who exhibit strong leadership and academic skills. Students that are chosen for this honor stay in a living-learning community in two of the nation's oldest and most renowned residence halls. After a selective application process, I was chosen as one of the 45 Scholar Leaders for 2010-2011. As Scholar Leaders, we organized and participated in service events and community engagement programs within the program and across campus. We also took a course on Group Leadership and had weekly community meetings to help plan and advertise our events."

    "text": "Everyone has the opportunity to have an influence for good. Each of us is born with certain gifts, abilities, and imperfections.  Each of us makes choices about how we will magnify or overcome our natural selves, and each of us decides how we will use our skills to help others.  One of the greatest recognitions one can make is of the ability we have to improve the world around us.   It is with that understanding that I desire to enter the field of medicine.  There are millions of people on this earth, and each is individually important.  I hope to help individuals live happier and more fulfilling lives by working with them to increase their health.  I have found that everyone has his or her own set of hardships.  For many people I know, these problems relate somehow to their physical health.  One of my closest friends hurts all the time.  Her muscles ache, she cannot lift her arm above perpendicular, and she is often tired.  She covers it up well, smiling as she plays sports or participates in social activities.  Sometimes, however, I can see her cringe and I know she is not feeling well.  This pain keeps her from enjoying life the way she could.  She has even had to quit a job she loves because it was too much strain on her.  She has asked me, Is this normal  Are you in constant pain  It kills me to have to tell her no.  It is here that I have learned that to simply save a life is not enough--we must improve it.  To improve a life takes a multifaceted approach.  This is where our own individual abilities come into play.  I can't fix everyone's problems, but I'm determined to fix the ones I can.  My interests and skills lie in the field of the biological sciences, especially the growth and development of the human body.  I look forward to taking advanced classes, and my bedroom walls are littered with posters of biochemical and physiological pathways and other aspects of biology.  I am in awe when I consider the complexity of the organs, hormones, and all the little pieces that work together to keep us alive.  It is a wonder any of us is still breathing, given the infinite ways for these processes to go wrong.  I just hope that I can learn how to fix them so that people can enjoy healther lives.  Studying and practicing medicine will give me that opportunity.  While in Nicaragua, I was able to participate in hands-on medical experiences.  I worked with the doctors and nurses to see patients and perform minor procedures.  Many people came into the hospital sick with parasites or bleeding from a machete accident.   I got to have the physician's perspective as I worked with them to suggest proper medication and bandage wounds.  As I developed relationships with the Nicaraguan people, I began to see them in a new light.  They were no longer strangers in a third-world country who needed help, but my friends and mentors.  I gained a newfound respect for people around the world, and I hope to work internationally throughout my career.  I recognize that these goals and desires--to help people be happy and improve lives around the world--cannot be realized with nice thoughts and good intentions.  Medicine is not a simple science.  To be effective as a physician requires learning, remembering, and applying the things taught in class, clinic, and life.  While serving as a missionary I spent three months with someone who lived with debilitating headaches. The doctors could not find out what was wrong.   We spent many hours and days inside our apartment because she could not move.  Daily activities became grueling tasks.  I sat in many waiting rooms and doctor's offices, watching them prescribe one more medication that would not work.  It was frustrating for her, and exhausting for me. While I am sure these doctors were well trained, it was still hard to never get any answers.  I would especially like to work with people who have conditions that are difficult to diagnose or treat.  I have always enjoyed finding new ways to look at things, making implications from known information, and solving complex problems.  This has especially come forth as I have been constantly suggesting new experiments as I learn things in class, and particularly as I have worked in a lab.  Some of my literature searches and their application have provided the basis for a new direction of experiments in the lab with which I am currently involved.  This experience has required hard work and long hours.  I have been in the lab late at night and for up to twenty hours a week above what I was assigned.  I spent this time and effort because I enjoyed searching for answers and solving problems, and what problems are more important than those that affect people's lives every day  Ultimately, my motivation for going into medicine is to solve those problems, and to help people to live more fulfilling lives.  As I have seen the trials of my friends, served in a foreign country, and played the role of advocate to a sick individual, I have been able to view the medical field from different perspectives.  These and many other experiences, as well as my love for the science of medicine, lead me to desire to practice in this field myself.  I hope that by doing so that I will be able to make my own impact on people around the world. Summer Medical and Research Training (SMART) Program As a participant in the Baylor College of Medicine's Summer Medical and Research Training Program, I had the opportunity to work with the lab of Dr. Francesco DeMayo.  Dr. DeMayo's lab studies lung development and cancer, as well as embryonic interactions with the maternal uterus.  The lab uses several mouse models to study different diseases associated with these systems.  Making a mouse model can be very time consuming, especially during the DNA recombination process.  My responsibility in the lab was to create a generic construct that could be combined with recombineering technology to eliminate the final DNA recombination steps.  During this process I had the opportunity to learn new techniques that I had only minimally used in the past.  While in the lab, Dr. DeMayo as well as several of my supervising post-doc and graduate students were in and out of town.  I was left to do much of the work independently, with only occasional assistance.  I was able to solve many of the problems I came across as I worked long hours and studied the resources I had.   Also during the SMART Program I had the opportunity to hear daily lectures on different topics within the biomedical sciences.  I was able to ask questions and learn things that I could apply to the lab at Baylor, and also to my research at BYU., Hospital Volunteer I had the opportunity to volunteer in two areas of Utah Valley Regional Medical Center: the Intensive Care Unit waiting room and the Emergency Room.    In the ICU waiting room I guarded the unit doors and admitted approved visitors. Despite the fact that I wasn't involved in any interesting patient contact, I was able to learn a lot from watching the families of the critically ill.  I could see the ones who had been in and out for weeks, and those who had just arrived.  There were some who sat in quiet solemnity as they pondered the imminent loss of a loved one.  Others had a family reunion, complete with games, snacks, and lots of laughter, as they tried not to think about what was happening on the other side of the doors.  Either way, seeing the emotional roller coaster and the trials of the close friends and relatives of those who were very ill provided an interesting perspective I hadn't seen before.  I am able to empathize better with the families of the suffering because of this experience.  In the ER I got to actually work with the patients. Wheeling them down the hall and occasionally checking on their needs offered the opportunity to visit and talk with them.  I am grateful to have seen these different views on medicine., Full-time Missionary I spent one and a half years serving as a full-time proselytizing missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  During this experience I received no pay and funded my own expenses.  I took off of school, work, and left my home to share with the people of Maryland the truths I hold dear.  Although leaving behind my academic life may not seem like the most rational decision for someone who is about to apply to medical school, I know that the things I learned as a missionary will benefit me throughout my life and career.  I had the unique opportunity to meet thousands of people of essentially every sort of background.  I made friends that I probably wouldn't have ever known as I visited with people, listened to their problems, and helped them to find joy in their lives.  I learned to see things better from other people's perspectives, how to listen and care, and how to be a more powerful advocate for people in need.  This experience, however, was not always easy.  I sometimes spent six or seven hours a day going door to door, looking for people who might be interested in hearing my message.  There were days when staying inside would have been preferable.  Nonetheless, as I diligently continued forward I was able to meet people and have experiences that would change my life and theirs., Undergraduate Research I worked in Dr. Barrow's lab for a year before I left to serve a mission, and am currently involved with the research there again.  We have been studying developmental biology, particularly the role of Wnt5a in limb development.  I started out in the lab performing basic experiments on mouse embryos.  After only one semester, the professor asked another student and me to co-lead a project (a responsibility not generally given to undergraduates) to describe some specific aspects of Wnt5a mutant mice and to use these data to try and elucidate some more information about the Wnt5a signaling pathway.  I had the opportunity to lead and instruct other students, and make decisions on how the experiments should be run.  I read hundreds of papers about Wnt5a and the phenotypic abnormalities associated with it, and combined the things I was reading with data we collected to think of some of my own hypotheses about the way this protein might be working.  I have recently returned to the lab to find that these hypotheses have inspired some of the experiments that are now being performed.  Currently, I am working with chick and genetically modified mouse embryos to work on a similar project, determining the effect of removing portions of the apical ectodermal ridge on the direction of cell division and migration., Summer International Medical Internship In the summer of 2005 I had the opportunity to spend 2 months in Nicaragua with the Foundation for Sustainable Development in a complete Spanish immersion program.  While there, I lived with a native family in Ciudad Sandino and helped in Hospital Nilda Patricia Velazco de Zedillo, a small hospital which consisted of an outpatient clinic and an emergency room.  In the mornings I would start in the nurses' station of the clinic and take vital signs and weigh the patients before they saw the doctor.  After an hour, I would spend time with different physicians specializing in general medicine, pediatrics, and neonatal care.  I was able to observe the doctors as well as participate in patient histories, suggesting medication, and performing procedures such as Pap smears.  I spent the afternoon in the emergency room.  I mainly helped patients who had minor cuts and wounds-- cleaning, bandaging, and occasionally stitching them up.  I also observed and aided the attending physicians in the central unit as well as the Oral Rehydration Unit for those suffering from diarrhea.  While in Nicaragua I also went to church, socialized with people I met, and gained a greater appreciation for working with those of third-world countries and the need to respect the culture and focus on sustainability when providing aid., Teaching Assistant- Biology 120 Science of Biology In the three semesters that I worked as a teaching assistant for Biology 120, I had the opportunity to work with many different aspects of learning.  The professor, Dr. John Bell, was the Associate Dean of teaching in the college of Biology and Agriculture and had done significant research on education and teaching methods.  Thus I not only taught Biology, I also learned a great deal about helping others learn.  I worked with individual students and sometimes had to invent five or six different ways to explain a concept before the light would turn on.  I supervised small groups and led them in the right direction as they worked together to do homework problems or practice questions I wrote for them.  I also worked in the large lecture hall setting, helping students solve in-class questions and even taught class a couple of times when the professor was out of town.  The class taught fundamentals of Biology with an emphasis on scientific thinking.  We not only taught about DNA and cellular respiration, but also how to interpret data and some statistical analysis.  Throughout all these experiences I was able to learn how to help others learn by leading and encouraging rather than lecturing, and gained a very solid grasp of the basic concepts in Biology., Science Tutor Upon returning home from serving a mission in April 2008, one of my greatest concerns was that I would not be able to remember all of the things I had previously learned in school.  As I began to open my textbooks, however, and reviewed the material, all the things I knew came flooding back to me.  So, I decided to apply for the position of science tutor.  For the past few weeks I have been working with a student taking a bio-organic chemistry class.  I generally work with her a couple of times a week, reviewing and explaining the lectures in ways she can understand.  In addition, I help guide her to understanding of the material by asking questions and leading her in the right direction.  Thus far, her understanding of the material has increased dramatically and she is much more able to perform well on exams.  This experience has been a good one for me as I have always enjoyed teaching science and seeing others succeed.  It has also been a good excuse for me to get back into the academic field before I start classes again in the fall., Teaching Assistant- Biology 240 Molecular Biology When I took Biology 240- Molecular Biology, I studied with a group of people I knew, and often played the role of group leader/ teacher.  In fact, they would invite their friends, and I was occasionally confused for a teaching assistant.  I decided after this experience that I enjoyed teaching biology and really did want to be a TA for this class.  I spent the following semester tutoring a student and helped him raise his grade about 20 points.  Over the next two semesters I had the opportunity to teach several groups of students.  We learned scientific concepts, but also discussed classic experiments in Molecular Biology as well as experimental techniques.  I not only helped students learn the material, but understood it so well myself that I could teach any lesson without notes or preparation.  Due to my previous tutoring experience, the professor would occasionally have me work one on one with students who were particularly struggling with the class.  As I helped them to understand the basic concepts that they had missed previously, they were all able to succeed in the class, and grades improved dramatically.  This experience was valuable in that I not only learned Biology and teaching methods, but also had the opportunity to ask questions based on the experimental concepts I was teaching."

    "text": "Hmm  The first part of the response I received was monosyllabic.  An utterance of neither confidence nor certainty.  In the average human, it should have raised doubts and concerns; for me, it raised questions and excitement.  What did this hmm mean and what would it lead to  I eagerly awaited another response, but the next was more cryptic than the first.  I'll be right back.   At this point, I should have been concerned, worried that something was wrong; this only served to increase my excitement.  I waited, questions running through my head faster than I could keep track of them to make sure they would be answered.  Suddenly, the door opened and a familiar site greeted me; a man in a white coat, stethoscope dangling lazily about his neck.  I expected an introduction, but the first thing he uttered was the phrase: Ah I see.  Once again, I was greeted with a response that offered no clarification, no reason as to why the first person had come and gone and no indication as to what was happening.  The first words offered by a medical practitioner to a patient should be comforting and explanatory, yet the response I had just received from a nurse and a physician were neither.  The physician had yet to look at me, and continued to examine my arm as he told me I needed to head to the hospital for some X-rays.  I found myself looking from my arm to him, wondering if either would offer some insight, until finally, the doctor looked up at me.  Your TB test was positive, but don't worry yet.  Worry  Worry would have been my last verb of choice.  I wanted to know how I had become TB positive.  What did it mean  How common is it  What's going to happen now  These questions didn't come to me out of fear, but rather out of curiosity.  This was fascinating.  I almost felt lucky, as if I were experiencing and learning about something that most people failed to have the opportunity to do.   During my senior year of high school, I was required me to learn about a career that interested me.  I chose to shadow a radiologist at a local hospital.  As part of the entry process for the hospital, I was required to have a tuberculin skin test; thus I found myself in the predicament I described.  The first course of action was to rule out active tuberculosis.  I made my way to the hospital to have a chest X-ray and a week later, I found myself in front of the desk of a prominent infectious disease doctor.  He informed me that I didn't have active tuberculosis and quashed the one worry I had, going into the annals of history as Tuberculosis Stefan, spreader of disease in Kalamazoo, MI.  This experience, among others, made it clear to me that I wanted to pursue medicine.  This curiosity to learn more about this ailment, to understand it better was an amazing feeling, and one I wished to experience again.  Yet it wasn't until the summer between my sophomore and junior years of college that this realization fully came to bloom. For a few weeks, at the summer camp of the Pediatric Neurorehabilitation Program at the University of Michigan, I, along with two physical therapists, an occupational therapist, and a special-education instructor, helped traumatic-brain-injured children learn to swim or at least become comfortable with the water.  One of these kids was having particular difficulties.  Movement limitations on land were exacerbated in the water, and this led to a fear of getting his head wet.  His fear was rightly justified, since any fall would have resulted in his head getting wet, as well as no means of returning to the surface.  Yet on this particular day, with many assurances that everything was ok, the kid went for broke.  He threw his head forward, under the water, held it for a second, and brought it back up.  It's difficult to describe exactly how I felt: the immense joy for his success, the relief to know he had enjoyed it, and the gratification of knowing that I had been a part of it; the moment was the most rewarding experience of my life.  This experience offered me a new outlook on medicine, and my desire to pursue a career in medicine.  Instead of it being just the next step, it became my passion; a change evident in my approach to school.  Yet this new dedication didn't allow me to overcome a poor freshman and sophomore GPA that wasn't reflective of my abilities. I spent the past year studying at the University of Cincinnati and earning my Master's in Physiology.  As part of the curriculum, I took medical school courses alongside the medical school students.  Whether it was having a stake in my education, my parents had previously paid for my undergraduate studies, or the realization that in order to achieve my dreams, now was the time to impress.  I witnessed a maturation within myself.  After my sophomore year, I realized that my previous performance in school wasn't reflective of a student wishing to gain entry to a medical school, and this year, the realization came full circle.  Working part-time and taking medical school classes offered me a new outlook on what entry to medical school required, and I strove to achieve that.  I have become more focused on my goals with a better understanding of how to reach them. Mentorship Dr. Hodgman, a radiologist at Bronson, served as a mentor for me for a period of five months.  I witnessed various procedures, and occasionally, with a patient's permission, his interaction with patients.  I also watched him view and dictate x-rays, MRIs, and cat scans., Summer Intern During the summers of Sophomore and Junior year, I worked as a summer intern for the Pediatric NeuroRehab Center assisting with children who had suffered a traumatic brain injury.  I helped children work through various activities including swimming, studying, horse-back riding, and writing as well as groups that focused on speech, community volunteering, and fitness., Volunteer at the CFF B. cepacia Lab I served as a volunteer in Dr. LiPuma's lab creating reagents as well as serving as a researcher.  The purpose of the research was to determine the best method of sterilization for portable nebulizers., Kaplan MCAT Instructor I teach MCAT content and strategies to prospective medical school students.  At first, I was apprehensive, because I was unsure if I could lead a class in the discussion of the wide array of MCAT topics; yet as my first class continued, I found myself finding the experience more and more enjoyable.  I enjoy teaching.  I am able to help students achieve their goals while simultaneously stimulating my mind through our constantly changing discussions., Volunteer at Good Samaritan Hospital I volunteer in the Emergency Department at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, OH.  I help facilitate the flow of patients to the registration desk and direct the family members of patients to the patients' beds.  The experience has been very rewarding thus far.  During a time of chaos and concern, I help to provide stability., Intramural Sports I was a team member and team captain for an intertube waterpolo team and a team member for a broomball team.  Our coed broomball team finished second in the league playoffs., Relay for Life I was a team member for three years and served as a team captain for one year of a Relay for Life team.  Each year, we raised, collectively, approximately $2,000., Summer Intern I worked as a summer float filling in for positions in the laboratory, billing department, medical records,  and in patient registration., Volunteer at University of Michigan's Health System I worked with speech pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and psychologists to rehabilitate children who had suffered a traumatic brain injury.  For part of my volunteering experience, I worked at the office, but during the spring and summer, I worked at the Therapeutic Riding Institute in Ann Arbor.  The Pediatric NeuroRehab center helped patients ride horses during these sessions in order to improve balance, strength, and decision-making skills.  I was a side-walker for the children that served to provide safety as well as guidance.  As a result of my volunteering, I was awarded a pin for 24 months of excellent service to the University Health System.,  Technician,  Technician"

    "text": "I became interested in medicine in 2007 when Dr. Wexler, an associate dean at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine spoke at a seminar I was attending. Over the next two years I increased my knowledge of the medical field by physician shadowing, conducting translational research and coaching a public health education program called Girls on the Run, all of which increased my interest in obesity related diseases, mainly cardiovascular disease and diabetes.   One approach to reversing the trend in the obesity epidemic is public health education. I currently coach for Girls on the Run, a disease prevention program that encourages preteen girls to develop self-respect and healthy lifestyles through running. This program incorporates healthy-living lessons into running activities. By the end of the season, girls are able to run a 5K. Participating in this program increased my awareness of the physical, social, and psychological consequences of health conditions on pre-teen girls. For example, I worked with a 4th grader named Katy in the program that was slightly overweight and afflicted with Asperger syndrome. She was nervous about participating in the program because she was afraid other girls would make fun of her. Katy didn't believe she could run a 5K or fit in with the others, but I knew she could do it. I encouraged her the entire season. I was always willing to listen to her ideas and gave her a lot of positive reinforcement. She trusted and depended on me to help her express her ideas in the group and I was flattered when she asked me to be her running buddy for the 5K. I feel rewarded knowing that I helped several girls, including Katy, improve their health and self-confidence. However, I am only able to interact with a subset of girls and their families. In order to impact the health of a broader population I want to go to medical school and learn the skills to prevent and treat common illnesses.  I observed physicians in various areas of medicine; family practice and cardiology influenced me the most. High cholesterol, high blood pressure, and type II diabetes were the most common reasons patients were visiting the family physician and are also risk factors for heart disease. I have personally experienced the impact of these diseases on patient quality of life and patient families. I was never able to meet my grandma because she died of heart disease before I was born and I lost my grandpa to a stroke when I was only nine. I felt like I was the only person without grandparents. I did not realize how common these diseases were until I shadowed. In general, the family physician and cardiologist treated the patients by minimizing their controllable risk factors with drug therapy and encouraging lifestyle changes. When necessary, the cardiologist treated patients with angioplasty or referral for bypass surgery. Cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes became of interest to me as a result of the loss of my grandparents. Shadowing encouraged me to work in area of medicine that deals with these illnesses and their associated risk factors.   Because I am interested in obesity as a contributor to cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes, I am pursuing a master's degree in Environmental Genetics and Molecular Toxicology (EGMT) at the University of Cincinnati in order to learn more about causes and treatments of medical conditions associated with obesity. Currently, I am assisting in the development of dietary and pharmacological intervention strategies to prevent and treat diseases associated with a high fat diet. For example, some effective anti-psychotic medications cause weight gain and insulin resistance as side effects. One objective of this research is to develop more economical strategies that are as effective as current treatments in preventing weight gain and insulin resistance. The EGMT program has increased my knowledge about how genes and environment, in particular a high fat diet, interact to cause disease. But in contrast to physician shadowing, performing lab work does not provide me the same satisfaction as interacting with patients directly.   Coaching the Girls on the Run program, physician shadowing, and performing research facilitated my decision to pursue a career in medicine. Girls on the Run reinforced my decision to pursue a career in medicine so that I can aid many people in improving health and reducing risk factors for disease. The loss of my grandparents at an early age and physician shadowing reinforced my desire to work in areas of medicine that deal with prevalent health conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Performing research made me realize my true passion lied in treating patients directly. Shadowing and research both made me aware of the need to treat patients effectively and economically. As a result of my experiences, I want to attend medical school and complete a residency program that prepares me to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other obesity-related medical conditions. And in case you were wondering, Katy finished her first 5K at the end of the season and is participating in the program next year. University Hospital Center for Emergency Care Volunteer As a Center for Emergency Care volunteer at University Hospital, I play an important role in maintaining the high quality of service offered to patients and the community. It is my responsibility to assist patient families by answering common questions, providing directions, or directing family and friends to additional help resources available in the hospital. In addition to serving the community, volunteering has helped me grow professionally. Every time I volunteer I have the opportunity to practice my communication skills with patients, visitors and hospital personnel. I also have the opportunity to develop problem-solving skills in an emergency health-care setting., Parish Involvement I am a member of the Good Shepherd Catholic Parish. I became involved in the Prayer Blanket Ministry in 2005. This ministry is dedicated to providing love and hope to those in need. In this ministry, I sew small blankets with a hopeful prayer inscribed for people in need of love and support. Many of the people who receive blankets are seriously ill. The blankets they receive provide comfort and support, reminding them they are not alone in their illness. The gratitude expressed by the blanket recipients is rewarding. For the past 3 years I have also participated in the Lamb Tenders ministry. Once a month on Sundays I watch parishioners' children while they attend mass. I enjoy working with children and helping out church members at the same time., Blood Donation I am a regular blood donor since 2007. Blood donation is important to me because without the readily available supply of blood, life-saving medical procedures and treatments would not be possible. So far as I have been notified, my blood has been used in treatment of two children at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. I plan to continue donating blood after this July 4 due to the one year wait requirement for leaving the country., Undergraduate research I conducted research in the lab of David Lentz PhD, for over two years. My project focused on Classic Period Maya agroforestry practices at the Chan Site in Belize. The objectives of our study were to identify trends in forest product use over time and to aid our understanding of agroforestry practices of the past. I identified plant remains using light and scanning electron microscopes, and by comparison to reference collections. Analysis of over 271 samples revealed several patterns of wood use including: a decline of pine use, increase of palm exploitation, and a dramatic increase in hardwood utilization during the Classic period. Pine seems to be imported into the site from the Maya Mountains along with other trade items during the Late Preclassic period. That exchange seems to halt during the Late Classic period when local hardwoods and palm became dominant in the assemblage of wood remains. These findings parallel models of rampant deforestation just prior to and perhaps contributing to the 9th century Maya collapse. Our findings were presented at the Society for Economic Botany and Society for American Archeology meetings in 2008, and will be incorporated into a multidisciplinary publication of the Chan 2000 year history. In addition, this research was the basis of my undergraduate honors thesis., Girls on the Run I currently coach pre-teen girls in a running program at the Blue Ash YMCA site. Girls on the Run is a disease prevention program that encourages preteen girls to develop self-respect and healthy lifestyles through running. The curriculum addresses all aspects of girls' development: physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being. Practice takes place twice a week for 12 weeks and an educational lesson is incorporated into each practice. Each lesson consists of introducing a topic, a warm up game incorporating the topic, and a workout in which the girls run or walk laps. At the end of practice the girls nominate each other for an energy award. An energy award is a cheer that the awarded girl receives for something positive she did during the lesson. Each lesson the girls increase the number of laps they can run. At the end of the season, the girls participate in a 5K run involving all the Girls on the Run sites in Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky.  This program successfully inspires healthy lifestyles in preteen girls and often times in their families because parents or siblings of the girls often elect to be running buddies. This commits them to get in shape to run a 5K with their daughter at the end of the season., Master's thesis research I currently conduct research in the lab of Dr. Shertzer at the University of Cincinnati in the Department of Environmental Health. The objective of our research is to compare conventional diabetic drugs to common over-the-counter medications in the prevention of olanzapine-induced adverse metabolic changes. Olanzapine is an atypical anti-psychotic associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes by causing: significant weight gain, glucose intolerance, and hyperlipidemia. Co-treatment with metformin or rosiglitazone minimizes the olanzapine-induced metabolic changes in humans. Acetaminophen, an over-the-counter analgesic and antioxidant, is also capable of reducing the weight gain and adverse metabolic changes resulting from olanzapine treatment in mice. The purpose of our study is to directly compare acetaminophen to metformin in its ability to prevent adverse metabolic changes due to the administration of olanzapine in mice consuming a high fat diet. We hypothesize that acetaminophen will decrease metabolic changes comparably to metformin. If our hypothesis is correct then acetaminophen may offer an inexpensive alternative or adjuvant therapy with conventional diabetic drugs to treat metabolic disorders., Women In Science and Engineering (WISE) Program I participated in the Women in Science and Engineering Program (WISE) during the summer of 2007. This program provided me the opportunity to work with distinguished female faculty. I was selected via a competitive application and interview process. The WISE program is a twelve-week intensive research program in which I worked closely with an experienced faculty mentor conducting research. The program structure included weekly seminars with guest speakers who presented strategies on how to research, write, and present a research paper.  At the conclusion of the program, I wrote a research paper and gave an oral presentation to faculty, staff, and students., University and Departmental Scholastic achievements I received multiple scholastic honors. I received Dean's list most quarters of college, I graduated Cum Laude, and I graduated with departmental honors in Biological Sciences. In the departmental honors program I completed over a year of research under a mentoring professor, submitted a written thesis of my research, and made an oral presentation at the university-wide spring undergraduate symposium and participated in the departmental poster sessions both my junior and senior years. I also exceeded the minimum requirement of a 3.3 GPA to be eligible for the program., Editorial Assistantship I was selected as editor's assistant for the 'International Journal of Toxicology' in the 2009-2010 academic year and my assistantship was renewed for 2010-2011. The assistantship includes a tuition scholarship and stipend. My responsibilities as an editor's assistant include: evaluating scientific articles submitted to the 'International Journal of Toxicology' for novelty of the research, selecting expert peer reviewers for submitted articles, proofreading text to detect errors in spelling, punctuation, and syntax, and data basing annual journal records. This job requires frequent initial and follow-up communication with submitting authors and peer reviewers and regular interaction with the Editor-in-Chief., Thomas C. Kane outstanding senior award I was selected out of 95 seniors in the Department of Biological Sciences to receive the Thomas C. Kane outstanding senior award. This award is given to only one senior each year. I was nominated and selected by faculty members in the department on the basis of academic achievement, leadership, and campus and community involvement., Physician Shadowing In order to increase my knowledge of the medical field and to experience first-hand what it is like to be a physician, I shadowed the following physicians:  Erik Powell, M.D. Family Medicine Alliance Primary Care 3306 Ruther Ave. Cincinnati, OH 45220 Phone: 513-584-8600 Approx. 30 hrs office observation  Dr. Suzanna Gomez and Dr. Salvador Rosales Internal medicine Hospital William Allen, Turrialba Costa Rica Contact: Rich Garrison main@adventurespanishschool.com  Approx. 78 hrs medical Spanish instruction and observation  Daniel Tramuta, M.D. Interventional Cardiology Comprehensive Cardiology Consultants 10496 Montgomery Rd. Ste. 104 Cincinnati, OH 45242 Phone: 513-791-2055 Approx: 30 hrs hospital and office observation  Brett Coldiron, M.D. Dermatology, MOHS surgery The Skin Cancer Center 3024 Burnet Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45219 Phone: 513-221-2828 Approx. 8 hrs office observation  Kathryn O'Malley, M.D. Pediatrics Muddy Creek Pediatrics 6400 Thornberry Ct. Ste. 610 Mason, OH 45040 Phone: 513-398-3900 Approx. 20 hrs office observation, Adventures Education Spanish School Medical Program The Adventures Education Spanish School Medical Program is a 3 week medical education program in Costa Rica. I participated in this program to improve my Spanish speaking skills and knowledge of the culture in order to better serve the Hispanic community as a future physician. During this program I learned medical Spanish terminology and patient interaction skills necessary to establish my ability to diagnose, take patient medical histories, and better relate to patients and their families in a culturally sensitive manner. The classroom curriculum consisted of daily, basic medical vocabulary and more detailed medical terminology, combined with medical exercises necessary to communicate with Spanish speaking patients. Classroom lessons were accompanied with weekly visits to local clinics and the Turrialba hospital. The visitations were observational with the addition of some basic hands on medical tasks including blood pressure measurements and using a stethoscope to listen to heart and lung function., What's In a Doctor's Bag 'What's in a Doctor's Bag' is a program designed to educate our youth about what happens at a doctor's check-up. Many children are scared to go to doctor and this program alleviates some of that anxiety. Our group goes to preschool and elementary school classrooms to read the book 'What's In a Doctor's Bag' by Neil Shulman M.D. The story tells of a young boy who is afraid of going to the doctor. On his visit, medical instruments jump out of the bag and teach the boy how they are used to keep him healthy. The book comes with instruments that are passed around so the children can become familiar with them. The goal of the presentation is to alleviate their fears of visiting the doctor. We also incorporated a new book into our presentations called 'Germ Patrol'. This story explains to kids how shots work and attempts to build their courage when going to the doctor. I participated in the program from summer 2007 until I graduated and served as membership chair in the 2008-2009 school year. I successfully recruited new members and expanded the opportunity to participate in the program to education, allied health, and nursing majors in addition to premedical students."

    "text": "In high school, I volunteered on Saturday nights at Regina Health Center, a home for retired members of religious communities, serving dinner to the residents. Before dinner, I always discussed baseball -- which players should go to the All-Star Game, the Indians prospects, the home run derby -- with Brother Green, a die-hard Yankees fan. In my senior year, over the course of two months, Brother Green's health rapidly deteriorated. He went from using a walking cane to a walker and then to a wheelchair, before becoming bedridden. During his final days, I brought dinner to his room and read him the sports section. It was hard to see how much pain he was in, coughing violently. I wanted to ease his suffering. But besides providing him the sports scores, there was little I could do for him. After Brother Green passed away, that desire to help him stayed with me, first sparking my interest in medicine. The first physician I shadowed was my uncle, a psychiatrist. On our second morning together, a hostile patient was admitted to his ward who refused to cooperate with the nurses. George was standing in the corner of his room when we arrived. My uncle approached him, walking slowly, and then dropped to one knee. In a calm voice, he asked, George, is there anything I can do for you He posed a few additional questions in a similarly soothing manner, and in a few moments, George was suddenly docile, agreeing to treatment. I marveled at the way my uncle handled this challenge with patience and empathy, using compassion to connect with a difficult patient. Since then, my uncle has become a role model for the kind of physician I would like to become. On a recent visit to India, I shadowed a pediatrician at a municipal hospital in Mumbai where my uncle once interned. The physicians, with only basic resources, treated a continuous stream of patients from neighboring slums with care and compassion. I would like to bring this sense of service to a career in medicine. During my two summers at the Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute, I sought to connect my interest in medicine with my lifelong interest in science, particularly my major, chemical and biomolecular engineering. For both summers, I worked in a tissue engineering lab, reacting polymers to form hydrogels, and testing mechanical properties of different biomaterials attempting to mimic cartilage. I also observed experimental animal surgeries including a total heart replacement, vertebral disc repair, and arthritic knee repair. Watching these procedures, I found my interest broadening to include not just bench-top research, but also clinical applications of this work. Though I found the science involved in lab research fascinating, an urge to work closely with people has compelled me to seek out opportunities to learn more about clinical medicine. While in Cleveland, I spent time in an outpatient dialysis center with a nephrologist. While learning about the different causes of renal failure, I came to know a dialysis patient named Frank, who one day said to me, You want to be a doctor, right Catching me off guard, I returned a hesitant, Yes. Well then, you are going to need confidence, he snapped. I regained my composure and reassured him of my confidence. Good, because I only trust a doctor who can look me in the eye and tell me what is wrong. I paused, and gazing at him directly, replied, Sir, your kidneys are damaged because of your diabetes, and you are going to need dialysis three times a week. There was a brief pause before a smile spread across Frank's face, and he began to laugh. For that brief moment, Frank had placed me in the shoes of a physician, and I began to see the degree of composure and confidence required. As a leader in student organizations at Johns Hopkins, I developed the kind of confidence in working with others that will be important as a physician. In my junior year, as the vice-president of finance for South Asian Students at Hopkins, I took the initiative to organize and prepare a culturally-themed lunch for 120 students, sacrificing considerable time and energy to ensure the event's success. It was a rewarding experience, and I became even more involved in the organization for the rest of the year culminating in my election as president. The same year, as treasurer of the Catholic Community at Hopkins, I helped plan and coordinate an interfaith potluck thanksgiving dinner with several campus religious groups. We expected about 150 students, but over 320 students attended. With some quick thinking and prompt action, I led the effort that ensured there was enough food and drink for all. As the president this year, I learned how to negotiate different personalities, settling, for example, a dispute that arose because a board member was not reelected by listening and empathizing with her, convincing her to stay involved in our community. My life experiences have ranged from teaching children in the slums of Mumbai to serving Thanksgiving lunch to homeless in Cleveland, nurturing in me a passion to be of service to others. This spirit, combined with an interest in science and research, led me to believe my vocation in life is to be a physician. I look forward to the challenges and rewards of a life in medicine. Host for prospective students at JHU As a member of Hopkins Student Ambassadors and the Multicultural Student Volunteers, I hosted high school seniors interested in attending Johns Hopkins University. The students spent the night in my dorm room and spent the next day shadowing me around campus, attending my classes and lectures. For MSV, the majority of students were from underrepresented minorities. I also shared lunch with prospective students visiting campus through a program run by the admissions office., Phonathon I called alumni all over the country to solicit donations for various funds at Johns Hopkins University., CHADIS Research Assistant I contacted parents of patients at Johns Hopkins Wyman Park Pediatrics, inviting them to participate in the Child Health and Development Interactive System (CHADIS) questionnaire during its development for the Center for Promotion of Child Development through Primary Care. In some cases, I sat with parents before their appointment and guided them through the questionnaire., APTT Peer Councilor I received training for a semester in Peer Listening and Crisis Intervention to become a peer counselor. I listen to students talk about their problems and ask questions which help guide students towards making their own decisions after a self-evaluation of their problem., SASH Cultural Organization I served as the vice-president of finance for the South Asian student group on campus for the 2007-2008 year, writing proposals for funding, filing for financial reimbursement, making purchases and assisting at all events sponsored by the organization. I organized service venues for annual Gandhi day of service, prepared and cooked cultural food for the annual SASH Class Bash, emceed both the Fall and Spring cultural shows, and was the deejay at the annual fundraising formal. I am currently the elected President of the South Asian Students at Hopkins for the 2008-2009 year., Catholic Community and Newman Group I started attending the Catholic Community at Hopkins' Newman Nights my freshman year and sang in the church choir on Sunday mornings. My junior year I served on the board as the treasurer, writing grants and proposals for funding, filing reimbursements, making purchases, and placing orders for supplies. As a board member my responsibilities included running one weekly Sunday mass, attending weekly board meetings, and running Newman Night dinners and activities on Thursday nights. In addition to cooking dinners for Newman Nights and planning activities, I was a major contributor towards the first Catholic Community sponsored Interfaith Potluck Thanksgiving Dinner and the Interfaith Center's Cosmic Coffee House program. I am the elected President of the Catholic Community at Hopkins for the 2008-2009 year and I am running the Cosmic Coffee House program for the Interfaith Center., JHU ChemBE Department Undergraduate Research I synthesized and experimented with multiple modified dextran and polyethylene based hydrogel biological scaffolds capable of supporting stem cell seeding. Materials used include dextran methacrylate, dextran maleic acid (Dex-MA), dextran allyl isocyanate (Dex-AI), dextran chloroacetate (Dex-AC), dextran allyl isocyanate-ethylamine (Dex-AE), and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEG-DA). From surface seeding experiments I found specific combinations of materials which supported endothelial cells and began searching for an optimum compositions which resulted in cell attachment and spreading on the hydrogel surface. Modified dextran-PEGDA composites have applications in tissue repair and regeneration, with the primary focus of my research on vascular differentiation, delivery, and regeneration., Academic Advising Tutor I tutored Cell Biology for Academic Advising to small groups of 3-5 students in the Spring of 2008 and will continue tutoring through the 2008-2009 school year., Friends of Baltimore Schools Tutoring I tutored math to public and private school students, ranging in age from 8 to 14, at an evening homework club program for children living in Baltimore's Remington neighborhood., Orientation Student Advisor I volunteered to be a Student Advisor for a group of undergraduate students majoring in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from the class of 2011. I helped these students select courses and offered advice on the difficult transition from high school to college from my experiences. I will continue to be a resource for these students as they enter their second year of college., REAP volunteer and fundraiser I volunteered to teach in a balwadi (small elementary school classroom) in the industrial slums of Kalva, outside Mumbai, India. Later, I wrote an article in the largest Catholic magazine in India, The Examiner, describing the experience and petitioning the community to assist in the effort to educate the poor. I continue to volunteer on return trips to India. I also help fundraise for REAP among family and friends., Dance Team Member I was a member of a Bollywood/Hip-Hop fusion dance team, Masti. All dances were student choreographed. As an exhibition group, we performed at various festivals and non-competitive events including JHU CultureFest, both Fall and Spring SASH shows, the Hindu Student Council's Diwali celebration,  JHU Parent's Weekend, and at Drexel University., Senator for the Class of 2009 I was elected as a Senator representing the class of 2009 to the Student Government Association of Johns Hopkins University. I am currently serving on the by-laws committee, rewriting the Students Rights and Interests section. Also, I represented JHU at the annual National Association for Campus Activities (NACA) SGA Conference-East and my group won the case study competition, which I helped prepare and present., AIChE Car Competition Team Member I worked as a member of the AIChE car team for two years, researching and developing ideas for a novel fuel source to power the car at the annual AIChE car competition. I helped in the design and building of the chassis and also in testing the car's propulsion system in order to calibrate the performance of the fuel cell., Cleveland Clinic Undergraduate Research I worked two summers, from May through August, in a tissue engineering lab in the biomedical engineering department at the Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute. My responsibilities included synthesizing a novel tyramine substituted hyaluronic acid (TS-HA) hydro-gel developed in the lab. The first summer I extracted synovial cartilage samples from the articulating surface of pig knee joints in order to test the ability of TS-HA to crosslink with cartilage in situ. I used differential centrifugation, isopycnic centrifugation, chemical chelation, dialysis, and lyophilization to extract and purify the proteoglycan, aggrecan, from cartilaginous mouse tumor cells. The pure extracted aggrecan was mixed with TS-HA to make composite materials with mechanical properties similar to synovial cartilage. The application of this research was for in vivo cartilage repair of synovial joints damaged by arthritis. My second summer I tested the mechanical properties of several TS-HA and tyramine substituted gelatin composites, calculating an aggregate modulus from the stress and strain data. This modulus was used to find an optimum composite with mechanical properties similar to the nucleus pulposus of vertebral disks. The application of this research was for vertebral disk repair and replacement."

    "text": "I have lain awake at night, more than once but not several times, having the misfortune to experience a complete and thorough purge of both ends of my digestive tract, unable to retain a drop of liquid.  I would shiver from perceived coldness around me yet sweat simultaneously.  This is the extent of the severity I have suffered from illness; merely a case of the stomach flu.  It is by no means life threatening, yet it left me so out of control and incapacitated that it is the image that comes up most frequently when I reflect upon the symptoms of disease.  I think that this is a reasonable representation because it reflects the loss of quality of life that is inevitable when suffering from disease.  It is also humbling to know that anything I have endured is nothing in comparison to that which a sufferer of a persistent disease must tolerate every day.   My general idea of healthcare is therefore treating patients to improve their quality of life.  This is aimed at improving their condition so they have less time impeded by disease or injury and more time living their lives.  However, this simplistic view does not encompass all aspects of health; for more serious conditions, death is the outcome if left untreated.  It is a natural part of life, but tragic when it occurs unexpectedly, leaving lasting pain for the family and friends affected.  I have had frequent reminders of this pain by witnessing the devastating effects of death on familes, losing members of my community, losing a friend, and also my roommate's father to medically-related issues.  These events have me firmly believing that compassion and understanding are required when addressing medical issues because it not just the patient's life but also the lives of his or her loved ones.   Now that I have explained my thoughts on healthcare, I will detail my personal growth during college.  As I am only applying to UCCOM through the Dual Admissions Program, I wish to use the rest of this section as a statement of appreciation.  I have already professed my enthusiasm for life, service, and healthcare in applying to the Dual Admissions Program, and my acceptance into the program indicates that you must believe this as much as I do.  However, I am not the same person I was four years ago; I resolutely believe that these changes have brought about nothing but improvement.  For instance, my interest in medicine is no longer an interest but a passion.  My reactions and reflections of my experiences with healthcare through my education, shadowing, and volunteering have me convinced that this is my vocation.  The timid curiosity of a high school sophomore in his first dissection has grown into a pursuit for knowledge and understanding of life's structure and function as a key to helping my future patients.   College education has helped me see the world more clearly and allowed me to evaluate and develop my perspectives.  For example, any romantic views I may have held about medicine were disillusioned by my trip to Jamaican hospitals, in which healthcare is often ground down to the raw form of survival.  Prospective patients would be given what they needed to survive and nothing more, because that is all that could be allotted.  The nurses, who provided essentially all of the treatment, worked tirelessly to help their patients without expecting anything in return.  I found their motivation truly laudable and I strive to exemplify that kind of resolve in my own work. Other than realizing my passions, my other major area of improvement is my character.  In college, I am now making all of my decisions and taking full responsibility for my actions.  This has brought about my maturation in behavior and values.  I have patience and balanced temperament in response to challenge and stress, allowing for more thoughtful decisions.  I have improved as a student and a mentor, more adept at interpreting and conveying information.  I have a new perspective that I live in a world with individuals, each just trying to make it in their unique way, not just by competition but collaboration, in which greater outcomes can be achieved.  This bestows an inherent respect for all, although it may be improved or lost based on actions.  Although these claims are difficult to prove in writing, it is enough that I know them, and so I take pride in my personal actions, values and beliefs.  I do not claim to be the model citizen; I am a man pursuing his dream.  I am grateful for my opportunity and I will be the best I can be.  Assistant Janitor (summers only), Volunteer at Grant Medical Center During my first summer at Grant, I volunteered  delivering newspapers, magazines, and flowers to patient rooms around the hospital.  I learned about how to interact with patients and the special care and respect that is needed when entering a patient's room.  In my second summer at Grant, I worked with patient transport to discharge patients from in-patient procedures using a wheelchair.  This required some training as I often had to assist the patients in and out of the wheelchair.  This was quite an enjoyable experience for me as I liked helping the patients leave the hospital and conversing with them. Overall, I had a great experience working with the patients and staff at Grant Hospital., Scholar Leaders of Miami University During my sophomore year, I participated in the Scholar Leader Program, which is a living-learning community on campus that is focused on community service and campus involvement.  All members of the community lived in the designated residence halls and enrolled in a class focused on topics such as social justice, personal identity, privilege, and reflection.  The community met weekly to present and participate in service opportunities both on campus and in the local area.  Typical community activities ranged from volunteering at a local soup kitchen to participating in homecoming week events., Ambassadors for Children: Jamaica During spring break of Spring 2012, I participated in a service trip to Jamaica with Ambassadors for Children.  Before the trip, we collected donations of soap and bandages for the hospital and we were able to bring hundreds of pounds of donations with our luggage.  The focus of the trip was on education and medicine, and we visited both the school and hospital in the rural town of Kemp's Hill. While at the school, another pre-med student and I gave a lecture to a sixth grade class with the topic of medicine and Jamaican health issues.  At the hospital, we distributed our donations and raised enough money to present them with a neonatal monitor., Summer Custodian Job For the past four summers, I have worked at my former grade school and church parish as a janitor.  I work all summer from 6am-2pm from June until I go back to school in August.  The head janitor is recovering from back problems and is only working for half of the day, so the two other student workers and I do almost all of the physical work.  As the oldest and most experienced summer worker, I often act as the leader and must take initiative with what needs to be done.  My daily tasks include preparing and waxing floors, painting, cleaning, moving furniture, and general maintenance work., Principal's List/Dean's List I have been on the Principal's List or Dean's List every semester I have been at Miami University.  Principal's List is awarded for students earning a 4.0 GPA and Dean's List is awarded for earning a GPA of 3.5 or greater.  I earned Principal's List in Spring 2010, Spring 2011, Fall 2011, and Spring 2012.  I earned Dean's List in Fall 2009 and Fall 2010., OMA volunteer and future site manager Opening Minds through Art (OMA) is a service organization that connects Miami student volunteers with elderly dementia patients in local long-term care facilities to conduct weekly art project.  OMA is intended to provide therapeutic art experiences to give the patients a creative outlet and help them cope with their disease.  My involvement will be directed at founding a new branch of OMA at a facility in Oxford next year.  I must coordinate volunteers as a site manager and raise $750 dollars next semester to cover the cost of art supplies.  I have committed a great deal of time to this project and expect it to be a rewarding experience during my senior year., Miami University Honors Program The Miami University Honors Program challenges students by obligating them to fulfill advanced requirements in addition to general major requirements.  Honors students must maintain a 3.5 GPA, complete nine Honors experiences, and submit an ePortfolio that reflects how their experiences have displayed inquiry, collaboration, critical thinking, intercultural understanding, and communication.  Honors experiences are often fulfilled by rigorous, interactive Honors classes, but they may also be completed by petitioning internships, research, or other experiences. Due to the more rigorous courses and expectations, the Honors Program demands several additional hours of work and study each week., Pelotonia 2012 Rider The Pelotonia is an annual charity biking event aimed at raising money for research to find a cure for cancer.  100% of the money raised goes directly to cancer research at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.  Currently, there are nearly 6,000 riders registered, who have collectively raised over $6,000,000.  I am riding with my father, and together we must raise $3,050 to participate.  We have recently met that goal and are looking forward to the event on August 10-12, 2012.  My course will be a 50 mile ride from downtown Columbus to New Albany, which I have been training for throughout the summer.  Additional information can be found at www.pelotonia.org., Shadowing Preceptorship with Dr. Taylor III The preceptorship was run though Miami University and pairs doctors who are Miami alumni with pre-medical students at Miami for a week long shadowing experience.  The preceptorship was awarded through an application process due to a limited number of participating doctors.  My preceptorship was from December 19-23, 2011, with Dr. Charles Taylor III, a colorectal surgeon at Mount Carmel branch hospitals.  Over the course of the week, I shadowed for about 40 hours, including  16 hours in the operating room.  The procedures I viewed included colonoscopy, rectocele repair, and full abdominal colectomy.   I thoroughly enjoyed shadowing Dr. Taylor and was grateful for the opportunity."

    "text": "Attending medical school has not always been a dream of mine. Nobody in my family has ever attended medical school, and, truthfully, my family has always had limited interest in anything scientific.  When I entered high school I thought that I would pursue a career in economics. During my sophomore year of high school I had my first significant exposure to biology, and I immediately realized that human biology was of great interest to me.  Since that day science has been the center of my studies as well as my hobbies. The physical world and the biological world have captivated me in both my academics and everyday life. Attending medical school would give me the opportunity to transform my interests into a career.  But I do not want to become a doctor simply because it interests me, I have always viewed medicine as a very honorable profession because of its dedication to helping people in need.  I witnessed such dedication first hand six years ago when my father had open-heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic to repair his mitral valve.  About 20 minutes after being brought into the recovery room following the surgery to repair his valve, a second, emergency surgery was needed in order to stop the bleeding that had developed as a result of the surgery.  My father lost three pints of blood, but the surgeons were able to identify the source of the bleeding and to stop it.  To say the least, this was a traumatic event for my family.  It meant a great deal to us that the surgical fellow who performed the emergency surgery was very caring and willing to devote a great deal of time to answering my mother's questions after the surgery and over the days that followed.  What I witnessed and experienced on those days not only confirmed my belief in the great skill of many physicians, but also the depth to which they touch people's lives and how they can make such a difference in the lives of their patients and their patients' families.  I came to see medicine as not only an honorable profession but as an opportunity to make a difference in people's lives. Being able to do this while working in a career built around my interests would be the perfect scenario.  Engineering Internship, University Hospitals Dermatology Research I have worked on a variety of different research projects in the Dermatology Lab at University Hospitals, Cleveland. My work has included  monocyte isolation from whole blood, as well as cell surface staining and analysis using flow cytometry., Interstate McBee I worked three summers in the Interstate McBee factory as a manufacturing intern. During the first summer I worked primarily in the shipping department, and during the second and third summers I spent most of my time working in the 'rebuild' division.,  Lab Technician"

    "text": "The official shook a clipboard in my direction. I could see he was saying something but it was lost among the earsplitting cheers of the massive crowd which had melded into an intense roar. He was signaling my entrance. As I stepped into the weight-throw ring at the 2010 Horizon League Conference Track and Field Championships, I felt a burning struggle in my shoulder. My muscles tensed against the full weight of the 35lb implement pulling my arm towards the earth. This would be the throw that would define my athletic career.  I felt no pressure. I began my throw. To the fans and spectators gathered it would appear as a flash; a finite movement consisting of 3 rotations of my body lasting less than 2 seconds. They could only bear witness to the balance, strength, and finesse; but were unaware the harmony of these characteristics would be the culmination of a lifetime of hard-work, dedication, and sacrifice.  It would be these qualities that would allow me to reach my athletic goals, and will help me achieve my ultimate goal in becoming a doctor.  Without the proper balance during the throw, the force of the implement would pull my feet off the ground. In the same respects, I've had to learn to balance my time against the forces of Division-1 athletics, academics, and volunteer activities. Despite 20 hrs of practice/week during my graduate program at Loyola, I was still able to tutor Roberto, an at-risk 3rd grader, as well as volunteer in the Department of Orthopedics at Weiss Memorial Hospital to assist in patient rehabilitation following surgery. I feel my athleticism was inspiring to many patients on their road to recovery as it was often the topic of conversation; however, my most meaningful experience was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) with patients that couldn't yet say a word.   Much as I was known for my athletic finesse, in the NICU I was known amongst the nurses for the finesse with which I could pacify the infants. The intensity of sound produced by the whole of the crowd at the championship meet would pale in comparison to that emitted by one baby in the NICU as it cried out in pain for appeasement of its addiction. Their screams made me feel helpless; I felt I had no abilities that could provide them with meaningful care. Then I realized that these infants were in so much pain that my strength was in my ability to provide them with comfort during their time of need. It was through this experience in the NICU that I learned the true meaning of strength.  Chief Yellow Lark of the Lakota Sioux said, I seek strength, not to be greater than my brother, but to fight my greatest enemy -- myself. The throw is trained primarily by focusing correction and improvement in areas of technique where mistakes have previously been made. I felt no pressure during my championship throw because the other athletes weren't my competition. I had faced my competition each day in every choice I made and had consistently been victorious in choosing to address my weaknesses. In this way I was able to develop my strength and mature as a thrower which led to a championship performance.  As I climbed the podium those around me reflected on the  performance of the day, but I was the only one aware of the struggle I had undergone to get to that point. It wasn't easy facing rejection after my first application. I can't even compare the sense of failure to my athletic career because becoming a doctor is so much greater than any athletic accomplishment I could imagine. At that moment I had a choice. I could accept that I was weak and allow myself to fail, or I could acknowledge my weaknesses and mistakes and seek to improve them so that I could grow strong. I honestly never even considered the first option, partly because my athletic training had instilled in me a mindset to never quit, but also because I'm certain in my career choice.  I chose to improve my academics through graduate work. In the Master of Arts in Medical Sciences program I learned to reach out to others, not only when they needed help but also when I was in need. I was humbled by the challenge to balance the magnitude of work with the directions I was pulled by my volunteering and athletic commitments. Through this continuous challenge I have matured as an individual and grown stronger as a student.  I choose to be strong for those who don't have the choice; I choose to be strong for my brother. The infants in the NICU, fragile from the unbearable pain they suffered, were helpless in their situation. They suffered the consequences from the choices of others, but my strength allowed me to provide them with the soothing comfort they needed. Through my strength in athletics and academics I provided an example for Roberto to aspire to during a time when his choices are critical in directing the course of his life to develop his full potential.  In a reflection atop the podium of an athletic goal realized, it became evident that I choose to better myself time and time again in order to achieve the highest it is possible for me to achieve and to aid others in achieving their potential. Although I may leave competitive athletics behind, the lessons I've learned have prepared me to achieve my ambition to become a doctor.

I've become proficient at feeding, changing, burping and comforting infants; despite being nervous the first time I held a neonate smaller than my forearm. I shadowed the attending and students as they made rounds and observed basic procedures such as tying off the umbilical cord. I've developed skills in bedside manner; which at times has arisen out of necessity upon receiving the look from a mother who sees a stranger holding her child. I often served as the intermediary between the families and the medical staff; families often felt comfortable asking me questions regarding the treatment of their child. One of my most memorable experiences was Easter Sunday when I helped arrange for a mother a picture of her quintuplets, dressed in pastels in a basket.  I worked with babies born to maternal addicts. The pain of their addiction manifested in their writhing and screams. I hoped their suffering would end when I administered methadone and comforted them. This provided some solace because I've lost a friend to an overdose of methadone. The experience taught me that concern, caring and a hug can do a lot for even the smallest patients., Tutoring At-Risk Youth I chose to work with at risk youth because I identify with their backgrounds. These aren't inherently bad kids, but the situation they've been raised in can make it easy to live life without developing to their full potential. I know how lonely the world can be when all you have is your dream. I've experienced the struggle they will face should they aspire to more from life than society expects from them. I want to act as a role model and mentor for Roberto, just as Dr. Colosimo has done for me.  I had some experience tutoring teammates; however, they were my peers and were eager to learn. Tutoring inner city youth proved to be substantially more challenging. The first time I met with Roberto I became impatient when he wouldn't complete his work. His continuous attempt to play hide-and-seek caused me to become so frustrated that I was unable to communicate with him. In case I wasn't already aware of the fact, Roberto had written on a piece of paper you didn't help me. Rather than give up on him, I reevaluated my attempts at communication. At his age I certainly wasn't looking for another authority figure. I believe he was just looking for a friend and someone to believe in him. I've come to realize patience and have learned how to provide him help he can benefit from., Children's Hospital I first worked with patients at a Halloween party. I was dressed as the Incredible Hulk and a small child was brought forth in a red wagon. I knelt down to give a toy to the child; but could see she was not so much interested in the toy as she was with me. She thoroughly looked me up and down. Suddenly, she brought her arm from her sleeve so abruptly that her IV was almost completely displaced.  She didn't flinch because she was preoccupied with flexing her arm. She asked me to feel her muscle, which I did, and for my opinion on its quality. I assured her it was a strong muscle. Upon request, I presented her with my green arm for appraisal. She asked if I thought her muscle will be that big when she grows up.  I was very moved by the experience; however, the impact of her question didn't truly begin to take effect until about 2 years later. I began to contemplate the events more deeply and realized how helpless I was to offer anything more than a slight distraction to the patients; patients that weren't much younger than me. The sickness I'd only heard in rumor and had never experienced had been brought to life right before my eyes. It now had a pulse, a voice and a life of its own. My experience at Children's motivates me to continue to make a difference in the lives of others., Zimmer Power Station Laborer I gained insight on the effects of career choice from my co-workers, which I gave personalities: the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  The Ugly didn't have the capacity required for skilled labor. He was insecure, would deviate from his responsibility and ask others to sign on as team leader. He taught me to recognize my intellect as a true gift not to be squandered. The Bad had dropped out of college to take the job he described as easy money. Each day he went through the motions and his misery became apparent. When I began to share his unhappiness I realized it was caused from an absence of challenge. The Good was truly working his dream job; made evident by the manner in which he approached his work. He demonstrated the happiness that can be attained from a career that's just right. He told me about his son who had recently applied to medical school, which added to my consideration of the career.  I was at a crossroads in life. It was my 2nd full time job working unskilled labor in a hazardous environment. I'd worked this way for the past 15 years. I've gained experience working under pressure, which can certainly be demanded of a doctor. I now value the gift of a medical education. I desire and embrace intellectual challenge because I've come to realize the satisfaction it can yield., Mini Medical School I met Dr. Colosimo in the spring of my freshmen year when he treated my wrist for an injury I received during practice. I inquired into his medical career and discovered he too had been a collegiate athlete and was now an orthopedic surgeon serving, among others, collegiate athletes and the Cincinnati Bengals NFL team. I became very interested with his profession and life story. He contributed to my interest in a medical career while acting as my role model and mentor.   It was under his direction that I attended a series of lectures held one evening/week for a month where he would be speaking. The lectures were formatted to simulate those given during medical school and given by medical faculty on current research. This experience provided me a broad perspective into the medical field and has allowed me to understand that which Matsuo Basho put best when he said, Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise. Seek what they sought. I initially had desired Dr. Colosimo's career; however, after hearing other faculty speak I began to consider the many careers in medicine. I've come to realize that I do not desire his career; rather, I desire my own career in medicine. His guidance provided me the inspiration to aspire to a life where I would fully develop my potential through becoming a doctor., Undergraduate Community Service I volunteered at Saint Rita's School for the Deaf in Cincinnati, Ohio on Halloween 2008 after some teammates that were learning sign language and working at the school asked for help. I worked alongside deaf children in a haunted house which allowed me to gain a different perspective on haunting as well as insight into the deaf community.   I volunteered at the Children's Hospital Halfway House in Covington, Kentucky on Martin Luther King Day 2009. I worked alongside children from broken homes to paint their recovery house.  I volunteered to clean streets in Cincinnati in conjunction with the fraternity Phi Beta Sigma. I am not a member of the fraternity; however, a teammate asked for help and I was able to participate a few Saturdays in spring 2009., University of Cincinnati Track and Field Captain/Member I was given an athletic gift which I saw both as an opportunity to develop the financial means necessary for my education and as a challenge for personal growth. I pursued a career in track despite the skepticism of many. My family and community saw a seemingly irrational pursuit. Their apprehension was not unfounded as even the coaches declined to offer scholarship at first.   Motivated by my dreams, I was compelled to walk-on the team. I learned to succeed by setting realistic athletic and academic goals and striving to accomplish them each day. I was voted captain by my teammates in 2007. I worked with my team to establish individual goals. We became united to push individuals out of their comfort zone so that each would achieve their goal. I established group study and tutoring for my teammates, and extended the sessions to other athletes and students.  Achievements: Best Freshmen Award  Freshmen and School Records: Hammer and Weight throw  2007: Most Outstanding Athlete Award  2008 Penn Relays champion   3x All-Big East Conference 07-09 (Top 3 athletes), Shadow Dr. Bokulic I was introduced to Dr. Bokulic by his wife, after she had heard from my roommate I desired a profession in medicine. Dr. Bokulic is a pediatric pulmonologist and is also faculty at the University Of Cincinnati College Of Medicine. I was inspired by how personal he made the visit, including taking a rather lengthy patient history. I had never before experienced the behind the scenes look into the career. This included not only the interpretation of X-rays, but coordinating the acquisition of the x-ray from other hospitals. Simultaneously, he consulted 3 other patients and gave each his undivided attention. Dr. Bokulic provided me with invaluable insight into the career. His biggest complaint was in the amount of paper work that is now involved with each patient; although, it appeared to me that his problem had several potential remedies. The experience helped develop my understanding of the occupation of a doctor as not simply the idea of helping people., Research in Organic Chemistry I was invited by my former organic chemistry teacher's assistant to conduct research for the department. My research was focused on elucidating the unique electrochromatic and fluorescent properties of corranulene through functionalization in order to investigate its potential use in organic light-emitting diode technology.   I learned patience following the 7 step experimental protocol in the solution phase synthesis of corranulene as well as the research process. The synthesis had to be restarted each time I spilled any solution during the transfer or allowed the solution to be contaminated with water during certain steps. The importance of accuracy quickly became apparent in order to maintain the precision of the results. The research process taught me to analyze and interpret results as well as use them in order to form new ideas. Often I'd use protocols outlined in recently published literature to synthesize compounds for investigation which taught me the value of careful documentation, interpretation, and reporting of results., Assistant Coach I'm naturally a very shy person, but track has allowed me to meet people and interact with different personalities. As a graduate student I didn't have much time available to spend bonding with the team; however, I soon realized a potential I held within to motivate teammates with my words. I try to lead by example in all things and can only attempt to inspire others to do their best.  After the completion of my eligibility as an athlete, my teammates came to me and asked for help. I couldn't turn my back on them. I immediately transitioned from the position of a teammate to a coach and actually took on the responsibility of developing their abilities. Their performance became a reflection on my leadership, and I used the skills I've acquired to push my former teammate to break a school record.  The most important thing I learned is that you can't coach the will to win. Athletic ability can be trained but ambition must come from within., Loyola University Chicago Track and Field Member I've come to realize the dedication required by greatness and the sacrifice that goes hand in hand with commitment. When I fell behind in my graduate studies I felt obliged to uphold my time commitment to the team and sacrificed some of the time I needed to excel in my studies. This wasn't a choice of athletics over academics; rather, I had a moral duty to uphold. I chose to do right by many rather than for myself. I was the one trying to do too much and my commitments had become greater than the available time. I learned I have limits.  This high level of competition has allowed me to experience the glory in championship and the dishonor of defeat. I've learned to approach things with a certain confidence. I perceive a record or accomplishment as inspiration to better myself. I ask myself to do more, and to do what others haven't done before. I anticipate and expect to be successful because I hold myself to a higher standard. It's not the success or the shortcomings I've taken away from the experience, but the values that I've gained that will allow me to be successful in medical school.  Achievements:  Weight Throw: School Record, NCAA National Meet qualifier, Ranked 11th Nationally  Horizon League Conference (HLC) Champion  4x HLC Athlete of the Week (December 2009-February 2009),  Labor, Student Assistant in Department of Orthopedics My athletic career as well as my work with Dr. Colosimo piqued my interest in orthopedics. Most of my volunteering had been with children, but this experience allowed me to work with adult patients in the clinical setting.   I worked with the department head to plan reunion parties for patients and complete data entry for patient records. I aided physicians in the pre-surgery consultation to educate patients about their procedure, expectations for their experience and to plan post-surgery rehabilitation. I assisted physical therapists in many aspects of patient recovery including helping patients set rehabilitation goals, motivating and working with them to reach those goals.   This experience allowed me to work with a variety of health-care professionals in different aspects of the medical field. I gained an understanding of the specific roles each has in patient care and the necessity to unite each for optimal patient treatment.    I observed a spectrum of different ideal patient outcomes in terms of functionality.  I'd become accustomed to younger athletic patients and found them to be easily motivated in recovery, whereas the majority of these patients were older with a primary goal of retaining independence."

    "text": "Everything in life leads up to a single moment and the decision made following that moment.  \tThe red fireball grows hastily, screaming through the night sky. The sound so loud it's numbing, and you find yourself eerily calm, as your body has not yet realized the impeding threat. As quickly as it begins it ends with a thunderous explosion then momentary quiet. Silence is broken by the cries of a close friend and the initiation of gunfire from the familiar Kalashnikov rifle. Time is short for the injured soldier if someone does not intervene, at which moment I rush out to begin treatment. Interestingly, I found I have an aptitude for being able to apply medical training quickly and decisively in order to save life as necessary. This all too real event happens to be one of the many experiences that have propelled my desire to become a physician, but this was not my original career focus. \tFollowing graduation from high school, I aspired to become a teacher in chemistry. The desire to teach is partly the reason I later found myself as a Green Beret, whose primary mission is training indigenous forces. The events of 11 September 2001 changed the lives of many people, myself included. My focus changed in the following months. I realized, at the culmination of spring semester at Miami, what I must do for my future. I felt compelled to serve my country before I serve myself, and two months later I enlisted into the United States Army under an experimental Special Forces (SF) program. \tI went through the most intense military training for twenty months, where I learned the importance of commitment and dedication to task. An SF candidate must be able to perform both physically and mentally better than 99% of the military in order to succeed. They must attain fluent command of a language like Arabic and pass proficiency exams within a six-month window. That is in addition to the multitude of other tasks each candidate must master. This is one of many factors that give SF training one of the highest attrition rates in the armed forces. Through committed effort I would succeed in training and for the next three years I would deploy to the Middle East. \tA Green Beret operates in small twelve-man teams where it's imperative you learn the duties and skills of the team around you. I was a SF Engineer Sergeant, but beyond my duty position I focused my attention on developing medical skills and training. If I was not on a mission, I was in the medical office expanding my understanding of combat medicine. \tWhile deployed my passion for the medical profession truly developed. During combat operations I would be called upon on numerous occasions to treat people on the battlefield under gunfire. The infatuation I developed for medicine eventually drove me to make a hard decision, remain at a job in which I excel or pursue my dream of becoming a physician. With decision made and my contract with the United States Army expiring, I registered back into college pursuant of my mission. \tWith a heavy class load, the dedication to task and focus I learned as a soldier enabled me to achieve high marks throughout my undergraduate studies. In just over two years from when I started back to college I will have graduated.  In addition to my academic pursuit I was involved as president of What's in a Doctors Bag and shadowed at University Hospital, Cincinnati. \tIn the past year I have logged more than 270 hours shadowing with Dr Jay Johannigman and the trauma team. During these experiences I've participated in numerous surgeries and trauma calls to the emergency department. While shadowing it was not uncommon that I stay with the trauma team for thirty of more hours interacting with patient and physician alike. Shadowing a giant in the field of trauma medicine has greatly enhanced my ability to communicate compassionately with patients and think decisively. Experiencing the clinical side of medicine has helped me know that this profession is something I must be part of.  \tBecoming a physician is more than a desire; it is a committed passion. My experiences performing lifesaving procedures, both in combat and clinical settings, have given me the initiative to excel in the grueling academic years to come. The leadership skills and the dedication to task I learned as a soldier makes me certain I will be able to overcome the challenges ahead. In the end I will stop and look back knowing everything has lead up to this moment and the decision made. Special Forces Engineer Sergeant During my time in the United States Army, I was a Special Forces Green Beret with occupation specialty 18C, the designation of an Engineer Sergeant.  My areas of expertise were logistics, force protection, explosives, tactical entry, and training indigenous personnel. Training Iraqi Special Forces was conducted using my learned command of the Arabic language.  I was the Operations Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) during Operation Iraqi Freedom IV with ~140 American soldiers in my charge and under my leadership.  I was head instructor on explosives, unit tactics, and convoy operations for over a year at a battalion level.  I aided cross training on medical treatment of casualties and administration of inoculations to both Iraqi and American soldiers. I fulfilled leadership positions and duties well above my pay grade where I excelled to a high degree, which acted as a catalyst for my rapid promotions and numerous awards. I was personally responsible for the ensured logistical and tactical support of a battalion of ODA's (Operational Detachment Alpha) for more than 9 months. This was one of the most rewarding, grueling, and fulfilling jobs in my life. In this job I learned extensive leaderships skills, mentorship, and responsibility., Assorted Medals and Awards During my time with 5th Special Forces I received the following awards, decorations, and medals in addition to the Bronze Star. 1- Army Accommodation Medal for service during Operation Iraqi Freedom III 1- Army Good Conduct Medal 1- National Defense Service Medal 1- Non-commissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon 1- Armed services ribbon.  1- Iraqi Combat Medal 1- Global War Terrorism Medal and Expeditionary medal 1- Special Forces Tab 1- Combat Infantry Badge 1- Parachutists Badge., Induced Optical Activity in Glucosaminoglycans During the past year, I have been conducting research under Dr. Apryll Stalcup and graduate student Floyd Stanley, investigating glucosaminoglycans (GAG's), namely heparin. The study was initiated in response to fatal interactions reported by hospitals, resultant from over-sulfonated chondroitin contaminating heparin stores from outside the United States.  Dr. Stalcup's research group and I have has been investigating methods to develop a new, innovative, and readily available process to rapidly test heparin supplies without relying on heparin activity. Using circular dichroism and dye complexes that specifically bind to heparin, a chiral (GAG), it is possible to change the spectrographic signature predictably and consistently. The long term goal and prospect of this research is to produce a reliable indicator complex that can inexpensively and accurately detect specific conformations of natural Heparin from contaminants. This would allow for medical establishments to test heparin quality and composition, limiting the chances of fatal patient interactions. This research has allowed me to be co-author of two and primary author of one potential publications., Analyical Chemist of the Year, University Cincinnati For my dedication to research and commitment to the field of analytical chemistry during the academic year 2008-2009, I was awarded the University of Cincinnati Analytical Chemist of the Year., Bronze Star Medal For unwavering leadership in the face of hardship, dedication to the mission, confidence in placing the lives of soldiers before my own, and the ability to think on my feet conducting more than sixty combat operations in the most hostile regions of Iraq, I was awarded the United States Army Bronze Star Medal.  A Special Forces Green Beret is often placed in leadership positions well above their experience level, where my ability to succeed was demonstrated. I became the Operations Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge (ops-NCOIC) of a battalion in preparation for and during Operation Iraqi Freedom IV from April 2006 to June 2007. Preparing for deployment I trained and advised 140 American Soldiers in combat operations and emergency life saving procedures that would ultimately ensure safety for the soldiers and the successful completion of their missions to come. Leading combat operations from the front, in spite of the mission's unremitting occurrence of danger, every combat operation was completed successfully and I brought the soldiers home without injury or life lost. For dedicated commitment to the stability of Iraq, pursuit to the health and safety of the soldiers in my charge, and passion to excel under all conditions I was awarded one of the United States Army highest honors: the Bronze Star Medal., Physician Shadowing, Trauma Surgery In June 2008, I began shadowing at University Hospital in Cincinnati, under the guidance of Dr. Johannigman once monthly until present. The experience begins during morning rounds, and often I remain on call with the trauma team until the end of morning rounds the following day. While rounding I have developed the imperative skill of appropriate bedside manner physicians must display while simultaneously being a leadership figure that develops the proactive health care of patients. I was afforded multiple opportunities to participate in surgery ranging in complexity from excision of foreign objects to splenectomies and lung resections. Through critical and intense supervision I assisted in the evaluations of patients condition and disposition, moments after their arrival in the emergency department. Medical training I developed as a Green Beret proved to be invaluable. On one specific call, my understanding of ballistic characteristics and wound pattern was called on to help verify a method of injury, better enabling the physicians to evaluate and determine courses of treatment for the patient. The experience has taught me the dedication it takes to be an integral member of a trauma team as well as physician responsible for the health care of a community in need., Triathalons/ X-terra/ Marathons Over the better part of the last six years I have been actively involved in numerous Triathlons, X-terra Races, and Marathons. In the Army, physical fitness is a critical component of everyday life. I found that physical exertion was my way of handling the stresses of military and civilian life. Looking for a challenge and to push my limits of physical exertion lead me to participate in my first marathon in 2003 and I have never looked back. When I completed my marathon I wanted to see just how far my body could be pushed. Since then I have been finding new ways to challenge myself. Up until now I've participated in 3 marathons, 2 X-terra Races, and 1 triathlon. These activities have provided an interesting way to introduce excitement, while challenging me both physically and mentally, while continuing to be my outlet for the bumps that dot the road of life., President, What's in a Doctors Bag The program focus is to interact with children and help develop their understanding of health care. The objective is to reduce a child's fear associated with hospitals and medical facilities. We have accomplished this task through direct interaction with children in grades K-3. Members of the group visit local schools and read a book developed by Dr. Neil Shulman. The book is designed to create discussion about health and lifestyle for children. Additionally, the book and it's accompanying Doctors Bag helps expose the children to safe toy instrumentation they may experience while at the doctors office. Through this interaction, the goal is to reduce the fears and anxieties many children have with visiting doctors and physicians as a result of being uninformed. As president of the organization, it is my responsibility to hold meetings, develop the outlook and plans for the organization for the upcoming year.  The duty also covers interaction with university administrators, develop continuity between the organization, the University, and the Schools with whom we interact. This community engagement opportunity was personally fulfilling and truly helped develop my appreciation for the complexity and thirst for knowledge children have about their own health care., College of A&S Research Colloquium This poster session was a research colloquium for all undergraduate research students to present the findings compiled over the year. Each student actively engaged in research through the College of Arts and Sciences spent approximately two hours explaining their study to those interested.  My poster was titled Heparin-Induced Circular Dichroism In Bicyclic Aromatic Anti-malarial Agents. In this study, anti-malarial binding with heparin was investigated using circular dichroism (CD) and UV/Visible (UV/Vis) absorption spectroscopic techniques. Heparin-induced activity of two bicyclic compounds, chloroquine and N-methyl-N'-(7-chloro-[4]quinolyl)-1,3-diaminopropane (QD), was observed.  This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of heparin-induced CD activity in bicyclic, aromatic compounds. These findings support recent research suggesting heparin-drug interactions occur mechanistically through electrostatic binding of GAG polyanions and anti-malarial cations. This poster session helped further develop my communication skills and discussion of clinical data., Special Forces Basic Combat Course While serving in 5th Special Forces Group, 2nd Battalion I was tasked with training and preparing 140 non-combat soldiers to deploy to Iraq. These soldiers, prior to my training had had little combat instruction. Due to the small size of 5th group, it's not possible to only take combat operators into hostile situations. In order for the unit to be successful at its mission in Iraq, these soldiers must be able to operate effectively under any type of situation. The three month long course was designed to put each soldier in command of a situation.  The training I developed, and the instruction I conducted or coordinated for, covered combat first aid, marksmanship, communication development, mission planning, and urban movement techniques. The learned skills of the soldier were reinforced using an experiential and hands on practical that was graded for performance.  The training culminated in a large scale, continuous around the clock 4 day long, simulated operation. Every scenario was tested, helping the soldiers develop and learn. The training I developed helped the unit and I bring all 140 men back from deployment without injury. This experience helped develop my teaching ability, lesson planning, leadership, multitasking, and coordination logistics. It may have been one of my most memorable duties"

    "text": "Recalling my past, I have had a special relationship with the toilet.  From my first months in the U.S. as a FOB - short for fresh off the boat, meaning a recently immigrated, maladjusted person - to seven years as a bulimic, I have cried, studied, and waited to complete this application, to the pungent odor of bodily excretions.  When the Asian Financial Crisis left my father jobless in Korea, my family made the bold move to the U.S. for the promise of a better job market.  Embarrassed by my broken English among my American classmates, I hid in the bathroom during lunch and studied my Korean-English dictionary.    To my financially struggling family, becoming a medical doctor was the highest honor I could achieve.   Because they funded my college education, I pursued a career in medicine.  When I had to drop a course and finish my departmental honors research as a less demanding undergraduate research project, in order to graduate on time post-meningitis, I felt I had fallen short.  There were other roadblocks in my endeavor to becoming an M.D.:  being left out of my family in receiving the long-awaited permanent residency status due to a clerical error, applying to medical schools without a green card and later fearing the financial burden it would place on my family, and not being able to adequately prepare for the MCAT during my sister's pregnancy, abortion, and brain tumor.    Because it was so gratifying to dismiss all self-control and eliminate the evidence of it in a simple flush, I sought bulimia for comfort, after two years of hard-achieved remission.  It gripped me stronger than ever.  I gorged with the knowledge that I was going to purge - in front of an open fridge, shoveling food into my mouth with hands because forks and spoons were too small.  The bites were so large it hurt to swallow, and I developed a rhythm of breathing to prevent choking in between bites.  After purging, I would assess the amount of food in the toilet to see if I had gotten it all.  If not, I would vomit more, sometimes until all I could produce was bile.  With stress came the urge to binge, but with subsequent purging also came guilt and the realization that I needed a more constructive way to handle difficult situations.  I was spending hundreds of dollars on food each month, and flushing the excess food reminded me of the emaciated children I had seen in global health documentaries, standing in line for food rations.  To compensate for the guilt I felt, I dedicated more and more of my time to helping underserved persons through volunteering.  Unexpectedly, I found the self-effacing joy of service along the way. I felt at ease sharing my stories of immigration and bulimia with people I met at nursing homes, soup kitchens, and free clinics, and they told me their problems of economic hardships, parenting troubles, and oftentimes, rising medical bills.  They welcomed me, reaffirming my desire to serve.  Their stories appealed to me, inspiring me to take actions to alleviate problems in my community.  During what I had expected to be a tedious wait period, I encountered valuable opportunities to prepare for a career in medicine.  I attended lectures by Dr. Paul Farmer and Sen. Bill Frist, discussed healthcare policies with Rep. Jim Cooper, and participated in the grant review panel for the HIV/AIDS Initiatives of the United Way of Metropolitan Nashville.  It was stimulating to read about Dr. Farmer's accomplishments in the U.S and Haiti, and to learn that doctors can improve the quality of patients' lives at individual and societal levels.  Even as a non-medically trained volunteer, I found opportunities to help.  I was elated imagining how much more I could contribute as a medical doctor, with the relevant knowledge and training.     With a more positive outlook and a concrete goal, I felt confident.  What I had initially pursued to gratify my parents had become the profession of my choice - medicine had become my calling.  Encouragement from the persons I met made my volunteer work rewarding and compelling, and I now view my body as one dedicated to service, to a selfless purpose.  Placing such value on my body helped mitigate my binging urges, and steered me again to remission.  Once after a binging episode, I was delayed in purging when the only bathroom in the house became occupied.  As I waited too long, fear of not being able to regurgitate triggered an intense panic attack - blurry vision, profuse sweating, with my heart pounding.  I am reminded of that feeling of distress and desperation when I see people in true need of medical care, too intimidated by the high cost of service to seek medical attention.  I remember the determination of my past self as a FOB too, hiding in the stall with my Korean-English dictionary and eagerness for learning.  I crammed the words in my brain with the same urgency I had felt during binging.  In my desire to help others, I am reminded of the feeling today:  the compulsion to learn, to act, and to become someone with the power and knowledge to navigate new areas of study and help those in need. Undergraduate Research:  RGS4 Transcriptional Regulation As a neuroscience major in undergraduate school, I worked on a research project designed to study the differential gene regulation in schizophrenic patients.  Following is a summary of my research in Pat Levitt Lab at the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center:  RGS4 (Regulator of G-protein Signaling 4) modulates the G-protein directed signaling pathways by increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis.  Its mRNA and protein expression levels are significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients in comparison to those of control subjects, but the mechanisms of Rgs4 regulation are not yet known.  In an attempt to study the transcriptional regulation of the schizophrenia candidate gene, we identified 15 putative enhancers by performing homology analysis across several vertebrate species.  Our experiments revealed two of the enhancers (enhancers 4 and 5) to repress Rgs4 transcription.  Subsequent studies identified CREB and HOX family proteins as transcription factors for Rgs4, with high binding specificities for the identified enhancers.  Future studies will focus on the differential regulation of the transcription factors in schizophrenia disease models and ways to target such regulation to restore RGS4 expression to the control level., Certified Nursing Assistant Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) training was offered as a part of the health occupations class in high school, and I took the opportunity to explore career options in geriatric medicine.  After completing the lecture and exam portion of the requirement at Northwestern Technical College, I received my clinical training at the National HealthCare Corporation.  There, I worked closely with the nurses and learned how to communicate with and care for patients while providing bedside care.  After developing close relationships with patients who had been abandoned by their families or coped with depression after losing their limbs to diabetes, I became interested in the ethical issues that physicians encounter in caring for elderly patients.  Inspired by the experience, I designed the project Exploration of Medical Ethics to increase my understanding of controversial issues in geriatric medicine, e.g., assisted suicide, living will, and forcible administration of psychotropic drugs., Hands on Nashville Project Coordinator During my first year in Nashville, I started searching for community service opportunities through Hands on Nashville (HON), whose website features a project calendar for local volunteer events.  Since sophomore year in college, I have served as the project coordinator for their biggest annual event, HON Day.  On HON Day, volunteers participate in beautification projects in over 50 Nashville public schools, to help create better learning environments for students.  As a project coordinator, I recruit volunteers, raise funds, and monitor the projects to ensure their satisfactory completion.  Through the organization, I also became a regular volunteer for the Dismas House and the Second Harvest Food Bank.  The Dismas House aids ex-offenders in finding employment and readjusting for a new start by offering food, housing, and emotional support.  At the Second Harvest Food Bank, I sort food supplies, participate in community-wide awareness programs for food donations, and serve in soup kitchens., Piano Performance I began playing piano at four years of age and obtained my minor in piano performance under Craig Nies, D.Mus.A., a nationally renowned pianist. Throughout my college career, I performed in a number of school-sponsored recitals with an assorted repertoire, consisting of works by Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin, Stravinsky, Debussy, Prokofiev, Bach, and Liszt.  I was also a member of the Shostakovich Trio Ensemble and the first pianist for Francis Poulenc's Concerto for Two Pianos in d minor.  Performance of the Poulenc concerto placed fourth in the 2008 Blair Concerto Competition, which was open to all instruments.  Outside of school, I have worked as a church pianist/music director and have tutored students in music theory and performance., Tae Kwon Do I hold a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and have won the Tennessee Championship title in 2003.  I medaled in two events at the tournament, in addition to beating an opponent of a heavier weight class in the exhibition match.  Since 2004, I have worked at Chu's Martial Arts in Hixson, TN as an assistant instructor in my spare time.  As an assistant instructor, I train students of all ages in various skills, such as sparring, proper forms, and kicking techniques.  Tae Kwon Do, along with occasional cross country running and soccer refereeing, has helped me stay physically fit and healthy., Research Assistant I I joined Knollmann Lab in the Department of Clinical Pharmacology of Vanderbilt University Medical Center as a full-time research assistant shortly after graduation.  Some of my responsibilities in the lab include biochemical analysis of cardiac SR proteins, mouse husbandry, genotyping of transgenic mice, cardiomyocyte isolation, ECG analysis, and general lab maintenance and supply ordering.  I have been acknowledged for assistance with the data analysis and the preparation of figures in Nature Medicine 15, 380-383 (2009), a paper discussing the effectiveness of flecainide administration in mouse and human models of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  I am currently studying the CASQ-2 linked CPVT model, using Casq2 -/-  mice, and the role of Casq2-related SR proteins in arrhythmia.  I plan to continue my work at the lab until medical school enrollment., Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science I served as a member and a team leader for Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science, a student-run volunteer group for teaching science to elementary and middle school students.  In a small group of three to five, we taught hands-on science lessons every other week at our assigned school.  The lesson plan consisted of basic concepts in physical sciences, i.e., electric circuits, refraction of light, sound and resonance, acid-base titration, and properties of gases.  Each lesson was accompanied by a fun, easy experiment and a discussion of the demonstrated concept afterward.  Because the lesson format encouraged frequent, informal interactions, I developed close friendships with my students.  Teaching also helped reinforce my knowledge of basic chemistry and physics., Hospital Volunteer/Physician Shadowing I volunteered weekly at the Hutcheson Medical Center in Ft. Oglethorpe, GA from 2000 to 2005 in various departments, including the ER, pediatrics, radiology, physical therapy, and the OR.  In the summer of 2006, Dr. Charles Adams of Full Circle Medical Center provided me with my first shadowing experience in primary care.  While shadowing, Dr. Adams taught me the biology of common illnesses and the basics of chelation therapy to treat heavy metal poisoning.  From 2007 to 2008, I shadowed Drs. Chavarria and Pate, general surgeons, at the Grandview Medical Center in Jasper, TN. Their surgeries involved mostly the organs of the GI tract, and the experience helped me better understand the anatomy and function of the digestive system.  Advanced technology in the OR and the surgeons' dexterity also piqued my interest in medicine and science., Project C.U.R.E. In order to improve the quality of healthcare in developing nations, Project C.U.R.E. (Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) provides the clinics around the world with medical supplies and equipment in high demand.  As a Nashville C.U.R.E. volunteer, I clean and sort donated items from local medical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, hospitals, and clinics, and aid in shipping the medical supplies to overseas healthcare providers.  I also participate in volunteer recruitment and event planning for the members of the Asian American Christian Fellowship at Vanderbilt University., Mayfield Project II:  Exploration of Medical Ethics In the past year, the members of the Mayfield Lodge and I learned about various disabilities from participating in Discussing Disabilities.  After completing the yearlong project, we wanted to learn more about the ethics involved in the treatment of physically and mentally disabling disorders.  We designed Exploration of Medical Ethics to further explore these issues, as well as controversial topics from broad fields of medicine, such as animal testing, stem cell research, cloning, and artificial insemination.  We participated in weekly presentations of current literature in medical ethics, as well as hosting open forums to discuss the assigned readings and films relevant to the topic.  This project was especially meaningful to me as it pertained to my experience as a CNA at the National HealthCare Corporation.  After learning about some of the ethical issues in geriatrics, I could understand and empathize with the decisions of care takers at the nursing home., United Way HIV/AIDS Initiatives Grant Review Panelist Metropolitan Nashville is one of the federally defined Transitional Grant Areas (TGAs) that are most severely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the U.S.  In my community, I have encountered HIV-diagnosed patients without continual access to medical care, due to lack of funds, reliable transportation, and/or relevant knowledge about treatment options.  As a volunteer on the grant review panel of the United Way of Metropolitan Nashville, I supervised the constructive distribution and employment of federal funds provided under the Ryan White Grant.  The panel awarded the grant to local organizations and programs best able to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate HIV/AIDS services, especially to minority populations disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS., City Lights Ministry My spring breaks in college were spent in St. Louis, MO for City Lights, an urban restoration project.  The participants attempted to reach out to the residents of redlined districts in downtown St. Louis, to help reduce the gap between the wealthy and the poor.  We volunteered at day care centers and babysat children to ease the burdens of working mothers, built employment training sites to help unemployed persons develop marketable skills, and collected food items and distributed them to financially struggling families.  Although I spent only one week every year in St. Louis for the project, City Lights gave me good ideas about what I can do to help Nashville residents in similar situations.  Starting this fall, I will begin volunteering for Habitat for Humanity as a warehouse volunteer, picking up donations and delivering supplies to families in need., Point of Dispensing (POD) Volunteer POD is activated in the event of an outbreak of pandemic flu, smallpox, or a biological event.  I received the appropriate training to become a POD volunteer, so that I may aid in dispensing medications, vaccinations, and/or relevant public health information during a public health emergency, such as the recent outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus., Mayfield Project I:  Discussing Disabilities The project, started as a part of the Mayfield Living and Learning Lodge program, integrated community service with a yearlong learning plan to achieve three main goals:  (1) interact with the students at the Harris-Hillman School of Special Education and learn how to communicate effectively, (2) increase personal awareness of childhood disabilities and correct any misconceptions and biases regarding disabled students, and (3) increase campus awareness.  To maximize the benefit of living together, I organized monthly meetings for the members of the lodge to present their research on the topic of the month (types of disabilities, biological basis of disabilities, public policy, etc).  In addition, we held weekly dinners for an informal discussion of our volunteer experiences.  We shared our findings with the Vanderbilt community with poster presentations, and hosted guest lectures on public policy regarding persons with disabilities.  The project increased our understanding of disabilities, as well as of cultures different from our own.  To complement the lessons learned from the project, we designed a supplementary project titled Exploration of Medical Ethics in the following year., Vanderbilt College of A&S Academic Achievement Scholar Vanderbilt University awarded me the Academic Achievement Scholarship upon my acceptance to the College of Arts and Science, in recognition of my academic achievement in high school (National Merit Scholar, valedictorian, Georgia Scholar, and the region winner of the Student Teacher Achievement Recognition program sponsored by the Professional Association of Georgia Educators Foundation).  I was also a member of Alpha Lambda Delta, Gamma Beta Phi, and Omicron Delta Kappa honor and service societies."

    "text": "If you get knocked down, pick yourself up, and keep on, keeping on.  Fr. Rudemiller concluded every mass with this inspirational thought. While simple, it can speak volumes.  Throughout my life I have had moments where I have been knocked down.  In fourth grade, I had my first challenging test. I took this test lightly, resulting in me failing it. From both embarrassment and the belief that I could do much better on this and all tests, I resolved to take my studies seriously. Getting back up and dusting myself off enabled me to discover a great deal about myself. It is in these moments, that one can show one's true potential.  Nothing comes easy and if it did, would it be worthwhile  I ran varsity cross country and track in high school. Running competitively takes preparation, motivation, and determination.  This meant waking up early in the morning on my summer breaks, while other students slept in. Yet, these summer runs were very important because they not only got me in shape, but also prepared me for the season ahead.  This preparation was essential to my success as a runner; however, as in all things in life, I had setbacks in running.  I injured my foot and hip several times forcing me to miss several weeks.  This time off motivated me to properly take care of myself and gave me time to focus on becoming a leader for my team.  With this continued hard work came success and it resulted in me running on the state team that finished third.  I take this same approach to all of my endeavors in life.  Attending college at Loyola University in Chicago was the beginning of a new challenge for me.  I had to learn to balance a demanding class schedule while learning to live without the constant support of my family.  Numerous times I had set backs, but I have always gotten up resolved to better myself. Most recently, I felt discouraged when not getting into medical school on my first attempt.  I felt disappointed in myself.  At this point, I could give up and pursue another career.  Yet, I know medicine is the right vocation for me.  This set-back like other set-backs in my life, only motivates me more to mature and continue modeling myself after my role model, Dr. Robert J. Thaler. This person is my dad.  While some young boys idolize their favorite sports hero, I have always looked up to my dad, a doctor.  I will never forget the night of my grandparents' 50th anniversary. The event was a great success and my family and I were feeling happy and satisfied as we cleaned up.  In the time it took my grandpa to suddenly collapse, my entire life changed as I frantically screamed to my dad for help. My father immediately laid him on his back and began CPR until the paramedics arrived. While my grandpa did not die that night, it turned out he had a ruptured brain aneurysm, which led to his death soon thereafter.  However, through the grief, I realized something: the quick response of my dad made me proud... I wanted to be like him. I wanted to be strong, able to make quick decisions, and capable of helping others. Currently, I interview patients for Dr. Vincent Martin's clinical research on migraines.  I have had the privilege of interviewing some of my dad's patients.  While discussing a patient's medical history, a discussion began about the patient's suffering with prostate cancer.  He told me, he owed his life to my father's thoroughness in his physical exam. The man had prostate cancer at the age of 40. The patient believed that few physicians would have checked a patient of that age for prostate cancer.  My dad's belief in working hard and not cutting corners had saved this man's life.  Moments like these only further inspire me to become a doctor.  Interviewing patients has challenged and rewarded me personally. Not all patients are easy to interact with.  I have had times, when I felt I had a poor interview with a patient and felt disappointed that I did not fully connect with that patient.  Yet, I use these moments to reflect on what I need to do to improve my interview skills. I cannot be afraid to pick myself up and go and interview the next patient with full confidence.  This experience will further prepare me for the challenges that lay ahead in clinical medicine.   Life is a series of successes and failures.  I believe it is in these moments of failure, when one can truly define one's self.  I have been given time to reflect on why I want to be a doctor.  In reflection, I am very certain that I want to and will become a physician.  Our world needs compassionate doctors who are thorough and do not fold under pressure or failure.  I see these qualities in observing my father and I see these qualities in myself.  As I dust myself off, I know I am ready to keep on, keeping on.  The words of inspiration might be simple, but they speak volumes in defining the person I am.  Clinical Research,  Customer Service, High School Cross Country and Track During high school, I was extremely involved in cross country as well as track and field. With plenty of hard work, I was able to run on the 2005 state cross country team which placed third in Ohio. Then later that year I ran on the state 3200 relay team in track which placed sixth in state. My senior year, I was appointed team captain for both my cross country and track teams. Through this, I was able to lead a large group of runners and help form a strong team. Cross country and track both required a lot of work and dedication. It's through this and other activities that I have become a hard worker, who never gives up on my goals. When I entered high school, no one expected me to succeed, but by the end I had become a talented and awarded runner. My senior year in cross country, I was given the Coach's Award for this dedication., Habitat for Humanity During spring break 2009, I was given the opportunity to take part in Habitat for Humanity with other Loyola pre-medical students over the course of five days in Mobile, Alabama. Our project involved raising the frame and putting up the exterior walls and roof on a large house for a family of 12. The family, from Kenya, had recently immigrated to the United States. For such a large family, they had no real suitable place to stay. While building a house does not necessarily help me gain medical knowledge, it was still a rewarding project. Serving others has become a philosophy I have embraced since I was much younger. It was rewarding to meet the family and see their excitement as their home came together. Their gratefulness was overwhelming and I plan to continue activities such as this for the rest of my life., National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine I attended this conference after my sophomore year in high school. During this conference, we participated in many medical activities including a mock draft and problem based learning cases. During this conference many medical doctors came and spoke to us. They were very upfront as they discussed the pros and cons of becoming a doctor. This program affirmed my interest in the medical field. I loved doing the case-study problems and also I enjoyed getting a chance to go to Northwestern Medical School and see the cadaver lab. Throughout the 10 days, we were given the opportunity to learn more about the medical field and medical school, as well as lead my peers in different activities. I am grateful I was given the opportunity to experience this program., Pharmacy Customer Service I have had this job, since my sophomore year in high school. Currently I work close to full time during winter and summer breaks. The original purpose of the job was to give me experience in a pharmacy, as well as in a medical field. The job has been beneficial in familiarizing me with medication names and their purposes. More importantly, most of my time has been spent in customer service, where I have become comfortable in interacting with customers. Some of the more important duties include instructing patients on the use of ambulatory devices and medical equipment such as nebulizers. I also have learned proper techniques for measuring and sizing patients for braces. The job has been very rewarding and challenging at times, but as with all good jobs it is good to return during breaks to see the workers and customers again., Migraine & Rhinitis Clinical Study My research position has been an important experience for me. It has both furthered my education and continued my desire to become a primary care doctor. The goal of the study is to find a positive correlation between allergic rhinitis and migraines. My role in the study has been to interview patients at an allergist and primary care medical office. Interviewing patients can be challenging, but rewarding as well. Each patient has a different story to share; building a relationship with each one is an aspect of medicine which I look forward to most. So far I have interviewed several hundred patients and I will continue to interview more patients. I am also beginning to author my paper from the patient data which has been collected. My goal is to see if there is a correlation between specific headache types and common medical diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. This will further challenge me as I continue to pursue a medical education. This experience has affirmed my interest in pursuing a career in the medical field and given me a chance to interact with and learn from patients unlike any other experience could offer., Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa is the nation's oldest honor society. I was elected into the society this May in recognition of my academic success and commitment to service at Loyola University Chicago. The society encourages life-long learning and promotes this through articles and videos on various academic topics. I continue to broaden my knowledge by making use of these resources., Shadowing Medical Doctors Since the National Youth Leadership Forum, I began shadowing doctors in various disciplines. The first discipline was cardiology, where I shadowed Dr. Dean Kereiakes and Dr. Eugene Chung, who are partners at Ohio Heart. I was with them in an office setting, cath lab, and operating room, where I observed open heart surgery to replace a mitral valve. This experience was amazing and showed me how advanced medicine has become. Next, I shadowed Dr. William Drew, a radiologist; observing him demonstrated to me how radiology has much more to offer than just the interpretation of x-ray films. Finally, I shadowed doctors in the fields of dermatology, internal medicine, and emergency medicine: Drs. Alan Burwinkel, Vincent Martin, and Jeff Cravens respectively. All of these experiences have been very informative. In talking with them, I was able to determine that they were happy with their decision to go into medicine, since it takes a lot of time and dedication. Knowing this has helped me continue to be confident in my decision.  I continue to shadow other doctors in Cincinnati and this allows me to learn from and observe medical professionals as they interact with patients., Academic Coach Target New Transitions is a program run by Loyola University Chicago which afforded me the opportunity to aid the Chicago community. The program took place at Curie Metro High School, a large inner city school. Every Saturday I joined other Loyola students to tutor and mentor freshmen and sophomores. I tutored students in their most difficult subjects, mostly being math and science.  As an academic coach, in addition to being a tutor, I was there to mentor the students through the difficulties of being an underclassman in high school. The experience was eye opening for me as I was able to see the struggles of these underprivileged students. The experience was also rewarding, for I could see improvements in the students who I tutored. One such student went from being a C student who cared little for the importance of education, to becoming a high B student, who now thrives on learning.  Not only did she do her school work, but she wanted help to improve her vocabulary, in order to prepare for the ACT. This was one of my most rewarding experiences in college, showing me a side of Chicago few have the chance to see. Working with these students has taught me the importance of persistence in the face of difficulty, as well as allowing me the opportunity to impact the lives of my students so positively., AMSA National Conference The AMSA National Conference occurred during my freshman year. I found this experience to be very beneficial as I got to meet and talk with many medical students regarding their experiences thus far. There were many speakers including Dr. Paul Farmer and Dr. Sanjay Gupta. They had interesting stories to tell as they both spoke on their work and hopes of seeing healthcare reform. The National Conference also had many clinical demonstrations, where I was able to practice suturing and intubating a patient. I had hoped to go back the following years, but conflicts with classes prevented this., College of Arts and Sciences' Dean's List The Dean's List is an award for maintaining a high grade point average throughout the semester. I have received this academic achievement all eight semesters in which I was enrolled at Loyola University Chicago. It is recognition of my dedication to academics at Loyola., Medical Mission Trip to Honduras This club was recently started at Loyola and has given me the opportunity to take part in two medical mission trips to Honduras. I took an active part in preparing for the trips by fundraising and was given the leadership position of Fundraising Chair for the second trip. My responsibilities included raising money and acquiring medication for the communities in Honduras. In one week we set up clinics in four villages treating over 1,500 patients. Here I learned the skills of obtaining basic patient physical information such as blood pressure, pulse, and blood sugar level. Also, we were able to work with the doctors seeing many rare, but interesting cases, such as people with scabies and parasitic infections. Others days, I had the chance to work in the pharmacy, filling prescriptions and instructing patients on how to properly take their prescribed medication. We also spent time educating the community on the importance of hygiene and boiling water in order to decrease the number of infections they are so susceptible to. The experience was amazing and the people of Honduras were so grateful, which made the trip so memorable. In the future, I intend to be active in global health issues., National Honor Society This is a prestigious honor society for high school students across the nation. A high GPA must be achieved to be given an application to apply to the society. Beyond academics, extracurricular and service work is also expected to show that one is a well-rounded individual. I was accepted into the society and was active in meetings and events, throughout the rest of my high school years., AMSA This is the largest pre-medical club on Loyola University Chicago's campus. The club has numerous activities intended to engage students interested in medicine. Activities include speakers such as Dr. Paul Farmer and Dr. Patch Adams, as well as trips to medical schools to learn about the application process. Another important part of this club has been its focus on community service. I have participated in many of these activities, including Special Olympics and volunteering at walks such as the AIDS Run/Walk in Chicago. With these types of activities and more, AMSA at Loyola has won the Damen Award for community service and leadership the past four years. This club has been extremely important to me and I have tried to stay as active as possible. My sophomore year I had the leadership position of being the C.A.N. (Campus Activities Network) Representative. Here I ran some activities such as the Asthma Walk and the AMSA Regional Meeting trip to Cincinnati. This club has been a critical part of my Loyola experience and has helped me become an involved student., Presidential Scholarship This scholarship given as merit from Loyola University Chicago is the highest possible scholarship to receive. It is for outstanding academic performance and commitment to service. It also continues to show my high academic standards in college, since a high minimum GPA must be kept to retain the scholarship., Intramural Sports Throughout my time at Loyola, I have participated in numerous intramural sports including flag football, soccer, basketball, kickball, and volleyball. These activities have not only helped to keep me active and fit, but have also enhanced my leadership skills by serving as team captain. This required me to organize team practices and ensure that members of the team were present and ready to play. Intramural sports also provided a means to better myself as a teammate encouraging both cooperation and sportsmanship. The main purpose was to have some good, fun competition."

    "text": "December 5, 1998. An ordinary Saturday for most, but for me, it was a day that forever changed my life. On that day I lost my biggest inspiration for wanting to be a doctor, my dad. From an early age, my dad suffered from Scleroderma. When initially diagnosed, he was given only 5 years to live. If the doctor's prediction would have been correct neither myself or my sister would be alive today and I would not have had the pleasure of knowing a man who not only loved and provided for his family but lived a life of sacrifice and devotion.  From the time of his diagnosis to the end of his life, my dad was on a downward slope that slowly ebbed away at his life. Though he knew that his life would be cut short, he never lost hope. His undying faith provided him with a positive attitude that allowed his life to be an inspiration to many. Everyday, his body was slowly fighting against his will to survive by hardening the tissues throughout his body causing everyday tasks like breathing to become difficult. It was hard to watch my dad go from carrying a portable oxygen tank to work to being bed-ridden, depending upon his family and Hospice nurse for his every need.  After my dad passed away, my character and outlook on life changed. Over time as I began to mature, my sensitivity, once a weakness, became a strength encompassing me with compassion for others and a strong desire to be an advocate for those whose voice was seldom heard. As my life continued to move on without the guidance of my dad, my mom was always there pushing me to not give up and making me believe I could be anything I wanted to be. As I saw my mom make countless sacrifices for my sister and I without complaint, I knew my life needed to be one in which I would do whatever I could to help people who were perhaps dealing with a similar situation.  Early in life, I decided I wanted to find the cure for Scleroderma so that other families would not have to endure the pain my family faced. Shortly after I began college, I declared my major to be medical technology in hopes that by pursuing this career, I would be well equipped to find the cure for my dad's disease. The summer immediately following my freshman year, I was able to work in a family outpatient medical clinic. While working there, I was able to see more of the doctor-patient interaction and the trust and quality care provided for each patient who walked in the door. I also saw the laboratory technicians who didn't have the same opportunities as those of the physicians. While their job is very important, for me, it didn't provide the same satisfaction that came with telling a patient their lab results were normal. I began assessing whether or not I wanted to be in a laboratory for eight hours everyday with little interaction or, if I wanted to do something more. Without asking, different people who I came in contact with that summer told me I had the makings of a wonderful doctor and should consider it as a career goal. Looking back and remembering my dad telling my sister and I to always be loving and kind and do what we can to help others, solidified my decision to become a doctor and made me realize this is the career I had been looking for all along.  As I began my sophomore year of college, I changed my major to Biochemistry due to my interest in science. Ever since, my grades and various experiences have testified to this being the career path for me although I still had an interest in research. So during that school year, I applied to various schools for an opportunity to participate in a research project. That summer I was selected to be an intern through the University of Cincinnati Physician Scientist Training Program. For me, that was important because I would be able to do research, as well as be a physician. As a part of the program, I was able to shadow Dr. Nandagopal, a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist. While shadowing, I saw the rewards and satisfaction that comes with seeing a patient get well. She had patients she treated for years, experiencing the growth and positive change of each and every one. Watching the relationship between patient and doctor made me realize how important a job being a physician is and the profound impact a doctor can have. In doing so, I would also be able to provide a service for others I always wanted to do and experience the rewards this type of service offers.  After my rewarding summer experience, I still wanted to be a physician but decided research was not for me. The importance of providing one-on-one care and help for patients in need outweighed my desire to find the cure for Scleroderma. Part of my dad's will to survive stemmed not only from his strong desire to live, but also from the dedication, care, and hope he received from his doctors and nurses. Becoming a doctor, would allow me to provide the same hope and care for those in need, fulfilling the desire and will to be of service to others. Alpha Chi Honor National Honor Society Inductee As a member of the Alpha Chi National Society, I am recognized as being among the top thirty percent of the Juniors and Seniors of Oakwood University. In November, myself, along with about 25 others were inducted into the Alabama Chapter of this Organization. Being a member of this society provides me with opportunities to attend conferences as well as being eligible for various scholarships., Lady Ambassadors Volleyball Club As a member of the Volleyball Club, It was required to attend three practices each week and be avaliable to play for any scheduled games. Volleyball is my favorite sport to play and being in this club provided me with an outlet for channeling and relieving stress I experienced throughout the school year. I also was able to meet different people who, under normal circumstances, I would not have been able to come in contact with., Teachers Assistant As a teacher's assistant, I graded papers and entered grades into the computer for the Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory. I was also avaible during the laboratory time to be of assistance to the teacher as well as answering questions the students may have had regarding the questions in the laboratory manuel., Volunteer As a volunteer at Summerlin Hospital, I work in the Emergency Department. I am also able to shadow an Emergency Medicine Physician, Dr. Elad Bicer., File Clerk Being a file clerk in this facility gave me an understanding of some of the things that go on in a family practice. Being a file clerk showed me the importance of keeping patients charts up-to-date. The doctors who were treating the patients needed a current chart so that a proper diagnosis could be made for the patients. Without current lab work or hospital visits being accessible in the files, the doctors would not have a clear history of what the patient was suffering from. While my job consisted mainly of filing, I was also able to greet patients as they came in by checking them in. One experience I had while working this job was the opportunity to help an elderly patient fill out the necessary paperwork for her file. This patient suffered from vision problems and did not have anyone to help her. I was asked to help the patient fill out the paperwork that was needed and she really appreciated me taking the time to assist her. That experience taught how important it is to help others in any way that we can and as a direct result of me taking the time to help, she commented on how friendly our medical office was and that she would refer to Rainbow as her primary care facility., Oakwood BioMedical Association (OBMA) Club Member Being a member of OBMA provides opportunities for community service, tours of medical schools, as well as going to weekly meetings. The meetings are geared to provide information on the application process to medical or graduate school and an opportunity to see various research projects from different schools. Often two weeks out of the month brings in different directors and or deans from various medical schools. As a member of this club, I have learned a lot about applying to medical school and doing research. I have also been able to volunteer at the Downtown Rescue Mission and serve the community., Resident Assistant Being a resident assistant in the freshman womens dorm at Oakwood University provided me with an experience unlike any other. I was paid to conduct a nightly room check at the scheduled curfew and a weekly room cleanliness check, to moniter the front desk on my appointed weekend, and attend a staff meeting once a week. However, the greatest benefit that I received from this job was not from what I was paid to do. It was the positive influence that I was able to have on those who were assigned to my wing. While my expected duties may have only accounted for ten hours out of the week, being a resident assistant was a full time job in that it required me to be available for those who lived on my wing whenever they needed help and being an unofficial counselor for them. At the end of the school year, the girls that lived on my wing would tell me how much they appreciated listening to them and being a role model to them. I cherish the experience I had being a Resident Assistant because it taught me how important it is to be a postive example to those around me by doing the right thing and treating others how I want to be treated., General Chemistry Laboratory Instructor My sophomore year at Oakwood University I was the laboratory instructor for General Chemistry. My responsibilites included making the weekly quiz, grading all pre-laboratory assignments and lab reports, setting up each work bench for the experiment and cleaning up the laboratory once the students had finished with their experiments. This job carried a lot of responsibility and I learned how to stay organized with all the grading that I had to do and I was able to keep up with what I had learned the previous year from my General Chemistry course., Class Officer My sophomore year I was elected as the Sophomore Class Fundraiser Coordinator. My responsibilites included coming up with ideas to raise money for our class and attend weekly class officer meetings. The following year, I was elected as the Junior Class Secretary. The responsibilities of this position included taking the meeting minutes and keeping record of issues that were discussed and resolved at our weekly meetings. For both positions, I was also available for any other officer who needed assistance with thier job responsibilities., Physician Scientist Training Program Summer Intern The Physician Scientist (MD/PhD) Training Program (PSTP) was a great experience. The internship included working with a mentor on a science-based project, attending PSTP student activities such as journal clubs and seminars. I worked in the Obstetrics-Gyneocology Department of the Medical School with Drs. Leslie Myatt and Victoria Roberts. My project focused on the levels of oxidative stress in three different groups of pregnant women. The groups were; lean, overweight, and obese. Placenta tissue samples were taken from each of these groups and various assays, immunohistochemistry, and western blots were done with the samples. After eight weeks of research, we concluded there were varying levesl of oxidative stress in each group. More research needs to be done in order to determine the effects such stress may have on the developing fetus., Dean's List Award This award recognizes the students of Oakwood University who maintain a minimun GPA of 3.5 with 16 or more credit hours per semester. Every semester that I have attended Oakwood, I have qualified for this award., General Physics Laboratory Instructor This job was fairly similar to the position I held being a General Chemistry Laboratory Instructor. I had to grade the laboratory worksheets each week and the quizzes which were already made by the professor. Before each laboratory period, I was also responsible for placing all the needed materials at each work station. I was also responsible for maintaining order throughout the laboratory period as well as being available for any trouble-shooting problems or questions the students in may have had. I enjoyed this job and was not able to continue the following semester due to a conflicting schedule., Shadowing While participating in the University of Cincinnati Physician Scientist Training Program, I was able to shadow Dr. Nandagopal. Dr. Nandagopal is a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist and I was able to shadow her every Friday morning during the duration of my summer internship. Dr. Nandagopal worked in the university's outpatient facility so the visits that I sat in on where conducted in her office. Her patients ranged from the ages of 4 to 21 who suffered from Attention Hyper-Defecit Disorder to victims of abuse. From shadowing, I learned some of the different drugs that were used to treat various disorders and the importance of gaining trust from the patients and thier families. Before the patients would come in for thier appointments, Dr. Nandagopal would give me a background on how long she had been treating the patient, what the patient suffered from, and the treatment being used. This experience opened my eyes to how important and beneficial it is to show each patient that you are concerned about thier health and to not dismiss any symptoms or issues they may have. Each patient is important and should be treated as such."

    "text": "I remember sitting in my fifth grade class daydreaming and looking about the room. I had completed my math assignment early again and was waiting for the rest of the class to finish. Since I hated sitting around staring at the ceiling, I would wander around the classroom tutoring other students who were stuck on a problem. It was then I decided with all of my fifth grade certainty that I would be a math teacher when I grew up. Being able to explain to my peers the math concepts that were eluding their grasp was a task that I loved and seemed to be good at doing. It was even more fun when my classmate still did not understand after my first attempt of explanation; I had to quickly come up with new examples and analogies that they could relate to and comprehend. I enjoyed being challenged to take seemingly hard concepts and pare them down into an explanation that could be easily followed. Lending a helping hand while being tested mentally brought a sense of fulfillment. The juxtaposition of these two ideas in the field of medicine has played a large role in my choice of heath care as a career. More specifically, over the years, I have come to be interested in infectious disease and epidemiology. Everyday doctors around the world in these fields are presented with cases and outbreaks that stretch their minds and force them to make new connections in order to help patients.  Now, more than ever, I wish to be able to help my peers and community understand concepts that seem out of their reach. However, instead of explaining math homework and teaching tricks that could be used in problem solving, I want to be able to help people learn the information and skills needed to take ownership of their health maintenance. I believe that an important part of medicine is not only healing patients, but also educating them about how they can live a healthy lifestyle and avoid becoming sick in the future.  My love of problem solving had not started in fifth grade, nor did it end there. My earliest memory of a passion for enigmas goes back to third grade when I read every book in the Nancy Drew mystery series my elementary school library owned. Not only was I fond of reading, but I also viewed the books as a challenge to decipher the mystery before the astute Nancy. The key to solving the case often laid in an outwardly minor detail mentioned in passing by a character. My reading pastime thus taught me the importance of paying attention to details while trying to make connections between them and the bigger picture.  Again, this attention to detail is a skill that is essential to the practice of medicine, especially when dealing with infectious disease. Patients rarely present with all of the textbook symptoms, so the physician must play the role of detective to uncover all the pertinent information to make the correct diagnosis.  As I look back, I believe it is my inquisitive nature that first attracted me to mysteries. As the youngest of four children, I was usually the first to be done with my homework assignments and thus had plenty of time to annoy my siblings. In my own form of annoyance, I could often be found sitting on my brother or sister's lap, asking them to teach me about what they were learning in school. I am sure that more often than not I would get on their nerves with my constant why or okay, but how as I sought to fully comprehend whatever it was they were willing to share with me that day. My constant quest for knowledge has not stopped; in fact, it keeps growing. Even now, I love to listen to my sister tell me about the most recent lecture she has attended in medical school.  Now, instead of pestering a sibling to share their wealth of knowledge, I head to a library. It is in books that I found my inspiration to put my inquisitive nature to work in epidemiology and infectious disease within the medical field. One of the first medical thrillers I was loaned was a copy of Richard Preston's Hot Zone, a manuscript about an outbreak of Ebola. The book pulled me in, making me wonder if I could be the one to come up with the vaccine for Ebola, or if I could become an epidemiologist and have a job like the main character chasing microbes.  After reading this story, I became interested in viruses and bacteria, how they spread, and how they affect the human body. I began to read many books about outbreaks of diseases and the people who are called to the scene of the outbreaks. The challenges the epidemiologists faced, the mystery surrounding the offending microbe and its spread, how the infectious agent caused disease in the body, and the ways the epidemiologists pieced together clues from various sources to solve the puzzle and thus curtailed the outbreak were, and still are, absolutely fascinating.   My career goals have changed significantly since elementary school, but the driving force behind my decisions has remained much the same. I still enjoy a good mystery novel and could read one cover to cover in a day; however, I now see diseases of the human body to be one of the most interesting mysteries to be solved. It is within the field of medicine that I believe I can best put my love of learning, inquisitive nature, and compassion for people to the best use. First Year Experience Mentor As a First Year Experience mentor, I was responsible for leading various activities for a group of about 16 first year students at Albion College. Those activities started on the students' first weekend at school with team building exercises and a follow-up discussion about how those exercises were good metaphors for life at college. Each week of the first semester, I led a discussion on a number of topics relevant to the first year experience such as campus social life, time management, diversity, alcohol and other drugs, etc.In addition to the required weekly activities, I planned and hosted other get-togethers to encourage group bonding. Also, mentors met weekly to discuss the next week's topics and what was going well or poorly with our gorps to determine the best way to create a safe environment in which the students would feel comfortable asking questions and communicating their experiences and concerns., Albion College Research Student Dr. Olapade's lab is focused on microbial ecology primarily in the area of microbial community composition and structure in various aquatic systems. While working under the direction of Dr. Olapade, I learned the techniques used to extract both plasmid and circular chromosomal microbial DNA from water samples collected from local bodies of water. I also learned techniques of PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis. As a result of broadening experiences in the sciences, I decided to become a chemistry major, and subsequently left Dr. Olapade's lab, but the processes and techniques I learned were invaluable and helped to cement my passion for research., FURSCA Committee Member FURSCA is Albion College's Foundation for Undergraduate Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity. At the end of my sophomore year, I became a member of the foundation's committee upon recommendation of a departing student member and at the request of the foundation's director at the time. The committee's responsibility is to determine which student research proposals will receive funding. Students apply for funding of research or attendance of conferences at which they will make a presentation. As a committee we review and individually rank proposals to decide who will receive funding and who must resubmit a revised proposal., Microbiology and Chemistry Laboratory Assistant Great Lakes Scientific Laboratory is a small, private testing laboratory that offers microbiological, chemical, and nutritional analyses for food and water. During my senior year of high school, I conducted an independent research project on the efficacy of produce washes at the lab. As a result of the skills I demonstrated during the project, I was hired as a lab assistant. There I mastered techniques in the chemistry department including acid hydrolysis fat extraction as well as using the GC and HPLC instruments to test for cholesterol, pesticides, and Vitamins A, C, and D. In the microbiology lab, I performed all steps required to test for bacteria such as E. coli, salmonella, and listeria in food products. I also completed procedures necessary to test for E. coli in water from local shorelines for the Berrien County Health Department. Along with these testing procedures, I also assisted in the prep room making both liquid media and agar for use in the microbiology lab., FURSCA Summer Research Student I began FURSCA by carrying out attachment schemes of undecylenic acid methyl ester (UAME) to the surface of glassy carbon (GC). These included using UV light to create a C-C bond with UAME. I also synthesized trifluoroacetic acid protected 10-amino dec-1-ene (TFAAD), a molecule that has been used to boost coverage of UAME. Once made, I carried out reactions to attach TFAAD then UAME to GC. I also tried to attach UAME with a hot plate and an oven. Once the attachment schemes were finished, I used ATR-FTIR to verify the presence of UAME/TFAAD. We verified that the instrument had the wrong configuration and could not detect monolayers on GC. We then tried using cyclic voltametry. Multiple schemes were carried out and analyzed using cyclic voltametry. Each test returned a  result, thus we could not confirm the presence of the monolayer. We then trained on an X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy instrument at the University of Michigan.  With the XPS we have confirmed the presence of TFAAD on the surface of GC. I was also trained on a Scanning Electron Microscope at U of M. I have used the SEM to confirm a proof of concept experiment in which we made a monolayer of UAME on the surface of glassy carbon, hydrolyzed the surface, activated with tin, and then grew palladium nanoparticles on the surface., Laboratory Teaching Assistant and Laboratory Preparation I have been a teaching assistant in lab periods for introductory inorganic chemistry and biology, as well as analytical chemistry. As a teaching assistant, I helped set up equipment and lab stations, answered student questions, and explained lab techniques. I also performed laboratory preparation for the microbiology lab, operating the autoclave to ensure properly sterilized equipment and preparing media needed for the next class period., InterVaristy Christian Fellowship Member I serve both as treasurer and president for Albion's chapter of IVCF. I accepted responsibilities as treasurer the first semester of my sophomore year and became president in the second semester. Beyond my administrative duties, I have also co-led Bible studies for both under and upper classmen. As a group, we have conducted outreach events for first year students during their initial few weeks of school., Emergency Department Volunteer I volunteered in the Emergency Department at Lakeland Hospital. I was responsible for ensuring that the linen closets remained stocked with sheets and pillowcases for the beds and gowns for the patients. I also provided beverages for the patients' families and helped to make them feel as comfortable as possible in often unsettling situations. I also kept cupboards stocked with equipment necessary for IV's., Oncology Research Department Student Assistant I was employed at Oncology Care Associates for my past two winter breaks from college. During the first year, I worked on a project that was a collaboration of Dr. Eric Lester at OCA and Craig Webb, PhD at VanAndel Institute (VAI). The goal of the project was to collect tumor and normal tissue samples from cancer patients and to run each on an Affymetrix gene chip. The data on gene expression, as well as clinical data such as response to certain chemotherapy regimens, is to be compiled into a database. Once a sufficient number of samples are collected, the goal is to genetically analyze new patients' tumors to provide suggestions as to what drugs may quickly stop tumor growth. As a research student, I entered clinical data into Xenobase, the database developed for this project by VAI. I also assisted with the collection and packaging of tumor samples from pathology to be sent to VAI. During my second winter break, my project mainly focused on a specific patient who experienced full remission of renal carcinoma while on chemotherapy. I began looking at genes that have been previously identified as being related to renal carcinoma or as being a target of the chemo drug. At the end of the break, the other research student and I co-composed a draft case report of the patient., University of Michigan Summer Research Student In Dr. Garneau-Tsodikova's lab I worked on two seperate, but related, projects. The first was a database of non-ribosomal peptides (NRP) and polyketides. Work for the database included drawing structures of the various molecules in ChemDraw, as well as searching for papers that included information on species of origin, synthesis, biological activity, etc. The second project was the cloning of the TioS A4 domain of Micromonospora sp. DNA. This species synthesizes thiocoraline, and antitumor agent that is a NRP. The TioS A4 domain is part of a modular multienzyme called a NRP synthetase that functions to produce thiocoraline. The goal of the project was to express TioS A4, synthesize and purify it from E. coli, then determine its exact roole in the synthesis of thiocoraline. During my summer in the lab, I was able to design promoters that would be used for PCR to amplify the TioS A4 region of DNA, express the protein in E. coli, and purify the protein. Unfortunately, the protein cloned was found to be insoluble in water, thus preventing further characterization of the activities of TioS A4., Project Alert Heath Education Leader Project Alert is a weekly health education class developed to educate 4th grade girls in Albion about making health lifestyle choices. Each week the class is focused on a different health topic such as health nutrition, drug and substance abuse, exercise and physical activity, and oral hygiene. Each year, the final class period consists of a graduation ceremony and party. I and two other women Albion College students took over for 3 graduating seniors who were previously in charge. In the past Project Alert students have participated in various hands-on activities including a cooking class where students prepared a healthy dinner, a physical activity class where students learned simple exercises and how to calculate their BMI, and an oral hygiene class taught by the Albion College Dental Club. We are currently planning the classes for the upcoming school year., Chemistry Club Member The Chemistry Club at Albion College is a group of students whose goal is to promote education and awareness of chemistry to our school and the greater Albion community. As a member of the Chemistry Club, I helped plan and conduct several campus activities. For the Little Sib's weekend, the club sponsored flubber making. Each participating child make their own bag of two different kinds of flubber, then club members explained the concept of polymerization. Our club also participated in Women in Science Day at Albion; about 20 local high school girls spent the day on campus to learn about opportunities available for women in various scientific fields. Among other activities, the students explored some of the science behind nutrition facts and extracted fats from nuts. In addition to the above activities, I also supported Green Day by helping present information about the benefits of green chemistry and talking with Albion College students about being green in chemistry labs., Directed Study The directed study I took with Dr. Kevin Metz was an introduction to the surface chemistry which provided the opportunity that will be the basis of my senior thesis. Several papers have been published on alkenes and carboxylic acid monolayers being attached to carbon surfaces such as diamond and amorphous carbon, but never to graphite. I began work in the lab to complete UV-mediated attachment of dodecene to the surface of graphite. I characterized the surfaces using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Initially, the sepctra indicated that the dodecene was attaching to both the light reaction surface as well as to the dark control. I eventually developed a washing/rinsing scheme that could remove the dodecene from the dark controls by disrupting the van der Waals interactions between the alkene and the surface of the graphite. Unfortunately, upon removing the dodecene that was adsorbing to the surface, it was determined that little to no dodecene was bonded to the surface. This project was continued during FURSCA summer research., Clinic Volunteer The Wildcats Wellness Center (WWC) is a small clinic located in Albion's public high school. The clinic, operated by a nurse practitioner and a medical assistant, provides basic medical care such as immunizations, sports physicals, basic laboratory services, etc. to people of the community between the ages of 10 and 21. A main focus of the WWC is education of high school students in the subjects of nutrition and the detrimental affects of alcohol and other drugs, as well as the consequences of risky behaviors. While volunteering at the clinic, I worked in the office with paperwork and organized educational materials. I also helped with evaluation of how much information the students had learned from the current health education classes. The nurse practitioner also allowed me to shadow her during a few appointments."

    "text": "I was five years old when my father, who had been smoking crack cocaine, came at me with a knife. My mother grabbed me and ran. I recently made the decision to contact my father, not with the expectation, but rather, with the hope that investigation into each others' lives could make healing possible. My gravitation towards healing, both in this relationship and in my future career, often surprises me because my childhood was strongly shaped by my father's inability to heal himself from his own addiction. However, I choose not to distance myself from these unsettling circumstances and believe that the healing process is a major component of medicine. Specifically, I view the application of a multidimensional approach is beneficial in the treatment and prevention of disease, as well as in the examination of socio-cultural phenomena. Both my personal and professional experiences have shown me the benefit of this particular approach to the healing process and have moved me to want to pursue a career in medicine.   I presently mentor a 15-year-old girl, Natasha, who is determined to be the first in her family to earn a high school diploma. She is the youngest of four siblings living at home and the only one without a child of her own. In her immediate environment there are few examples of what it would look like to succeed educationally and rise above her socio-economic deprivation. Joint exploration of her circumstances has enabled Natasha and I to formulate an innovative plan designed to lead her step-by-step through each of her personal and academic goals. Through example and encouragement, I am helping her to recognize and develop her skills and capacities. Our relationship continually teaches me the importance of collaboration: between mentor and mentee, and also between doctor and patient. While I highly respect the healing that can be done in a clinical setting, I think it is essential for a physician to extend this action to the community. Being a mentor has taught me to explore ways in which I, and systems, can best support people to heal.  Currently, I work as a research assistant for a Brown University clinical trial in alcohol addiction. With the participants, I witness the heterogeneity of alcohol dependence through the diversity and severity of their symptoms, and I now realize that alcohol addiction is made complex by the layered psychosocial, neurological, and external triggers. Because there is no single pharmacological drug or therapeutic method that guarantees the cure of alcohol dependence, healing is almost always an ongoing and fragmented process. Working in the study has also exposed me to the human component of research that entails a patient-caregiver relationship. On a daily basis I record medical and drinking histories, administer the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR-Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) Research Version, dispense medication and assess whether or not the participant is experiencing side effects as a consequence of the medication. As a front-line person, working with people who are alcohol dependent, I have learned that although disease is often examined and explained within a clinical context, it also extends into a social realm. Thus, healing involves the integration of human interaction, clinical and scientific knowledge, and comprehension of social elements. Being a research assistant is the beginning of a career path in medicine that I want to develop through further education.  My personal experiences, at work and in my relationships, have illustrated that the process of healing necessitates a multidimensional approach. Understanding the emotional and physical dimensions of people has made me more self-aware and has challenged me to move forward with my personal healing. As a result, I realize that healing not only exists in a medical realm, but is applicable in many contexts. Such an understanding unifies medicine, patients, and doctors by integrating them into larger societal systems. I am most passionate about achieving a medical degree because it will grant me greater tools to connect people with their emotional, physical and social well being. I look forward to investigating the multiple dimensions of patient healing as well as the challenges that exist beyond the clinical space. Volunteer 2001 marked the 50 year anniversary of the Baha'i Faith in Uganda. To commemorate this, an international Baha'i conference was held at the Baha'i Temple in Kampala. I helped facilitate this conference by organizing group meetings and guided people to a variety of venues. Leading up to the conference, I helped the surrounding villages by building school desks and benches., Film Festival Coordinator As a Liberian and active member of the Providence community, I felt it was important to provide the local citizens with access to the film Pray the Devil Back to Hell, a documentary about female leadership in the Liberian peace movement. To facilitate this, I contacted the film's production company (Fork Films) and requested the movie rights for a Brown University screening. This small idea for a screening soon expanded into a weekend-long film festival celebrating women in Africa. I planned, promoted and co-hosted this series of events with Brown University's African Students Association., Abstracts As a result of my research experience I contributed to two abstracts:  Kenna, GA., Leggio, L., McGeary,J., McGeary, C., Zywiak, W., Ciminelli, N.,Wilson, B., Tawse-Butha, K., Swift, R.M.  UTILIZATION OF ALCOHOL SELF-ADMINISTRATION EXPERIMENT (ASAE) STUDIES FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN NON-TREATMENT SEEKING ALCOHOL DEPENDENT SUBJECTS. Research Society on Alcoholism, San Diego CA, June 2009.  Fenton, M, Leggio, L., Kenna, G.A., Tawse-Butha K., Swift, R.M.  HIV TESTING AMONG HAZARDOUS DRINKERS; A SURVEY ANALYSIS, Research Society on Alcoholism, San Diego CA, June 2009., Volunteer At the patient discharge desk, I assisted patients who were preparing to leave the facility. This included making transportation arrangements, checking patients out of their rooms and sharing in their joy of being healthy enough to leave the hospital., Intern During this internship at a residential facility for girls and young women, I served as a classroom resource and counselor. I helped students through their crisis prevention steps by providing emotional support and listening to their concerns. I also assisted students with class assignments and helped organize an astrology-focused Science Fair Project. On a larger scale, I planned and executed a Women's Day Celebration for which the residents created artwork, poems, and short essays about influential women throughout history., Volunteer I assisted in a week long Hurricane Katrina relief project by helping to repair local homes and clear debris from yards and parks in the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. I was humbled by working with people who had lost all of their material possessions but had found the strength and courage to rebuild their lives., Group Leader I assisted in the development and management of gardens in two inner-city schools in the Boston area. Children ages 6-12, with whom we grew the gardens, were able to learn about the importance of nutrition. We used the greens and vegetables that we grew as ingredients in a variety of recipes such as pesto, salads, and soups. Thus, the gardens exemplified that fresh produce can be accessible, inexpensive, and delicious., Co-Coordinator I assisted in the development of a non-profit organization that brings primary education to children in Lilongwe, Malawi. During the formation of this organization I traveled to Malawi in the spring of 2005 and the summer of 2006. During that time I helped to select a group of socially disadvantaged, yet academically strong children and arranged for them to attend area schools. To fund this, I coordinated the purchase and transport of local merchandise to be resold in the United States at small events. Also, while in Lilongwe, I volunteered in an orphanage for HIV-positive babies. Furthermore, I was afforded the opportunity to visit the pediatrics wing of the hospital in Lilongwe, where I distributed fruit and soap to the families of the patients., Research Assistant I coordinate a laboratory study on alcohol use disorders. This includes the recruitment of participants and the conducting of weekly assessments. Also, I am responsible for lab maintenance and organization, material purchasing and finances. I also assisted with an NIAA multi-site treatment study for alcohol dependence. This research experience has taught me the importance of organization, interpersonal relationships with clients and team members, and about data collection and analysis. The position has put me in close proximity with the world of medicine. Working with addicts has shown me the repercussions of unhealthy lifestyles that led to the creation of many medical problems that the health care system contends with. Specifically, the misuse of alcohol is the cause of one of the leading forms of addiction in the United States. Consequently, I am constantly reminded that medical problems can extend beyond the individual and affect the larger community., Mentor I foster and maintain a relationship with an underprivileged teen living in Providence. Together, we set realistic goals and have weekly meetings to work towards these goals. Regularly, I expose her to creative projects, community involvement and other confidence-building activities. As a result, my mentee has reversed her failing grades, passed the tenth grade and voluntarily participated in a financial literacy course., English Teacher I independently taught beginner and advanced English at the Catholic University of Quito. I enhanced the daily lesson plans by adding popular media and hosting discussions so that the students could practice the conversational aspects of their new language. Teaching helped me to develop confidence in my leadership skills because I was able to convey concepts that led my students to show improved proficiency. On a personal level my fluency in Spanish was solidified., Teaching Assistant for Foundation Photography I taught classes about the basic  techniques of photography to college students, critiqued and graded assignments and assisted with dark-room film development. I also prepared the chemicals necessary to develop and print film., Dean's List I was placed on the Deans' List in the Spring and Fall of 2005., Group Leader On the Bri Bri Reservation I assisted with an initiative designed to teach local residents efficient farming techniques such as land-terracing. While at the Guayme Reservation, I helped to manage fence building and water purification projects. I also taught kindergarten classes for the local children., Health Assistant Volunteer While shadowing doctors and dentists, I checked vital signs, performed eye examinations, assisted with the recording of medical histories and helped distribute medication. I also conceptualized and designed health posters for discussions about disease and disease prevention, and taught English to teenagers. Working closely with youth from poor areas in Quito highlighted the fact that social dilemmas and medicine are interconnected. On a daily basis, I saw how poverty largely denies people basic medical care. For instance, the majority of children I interacted with had dental caries, persistent respiratory infections, and suffered from malnutrition. The combination of a lack of education and extreme poverty give rise to chronic ailments that would be preventable in other circumstances. I learned that practitioners not only treat disease, but also educate patients in order to prevent recurrences."

    "text": "It was a beautiful Caribbean day at the beach.   My father and I were swimming in the ocean and I was having the time of my life.  At the age of six, I was already a good swimmer.   Between traveling to my father's family home in Antigua, and living in Florida it was a skill I picked up early.  On this particular day, we were on a family vacation with my mother, aunt, and brother who had all stayed on shore.    As the large waves approached, my dad and I would leap up and ride them for a short distance.  Neither of us realized that we were being pulled further and further away from the shore.  Suddenly, my dad noticed that his feet could no longer touch the bottom.  We had been caught in a riptide.  Water started to cover my head; my eyes were huge as I began to fight for my life.  My dad made his way over to me, grabbed me by the waist and flung me toward the shore. I remember him saying, Use big arms Hamadi! Big Arms! a phrase my beginning swimming instructor used.  Instinctively, my father knew that using big arms would save my life. He also knew that he could not do it for me.  I would have to save myself.  Eventually a nearby stranger was able to reach me and helped me safely to shore.    Having a near drowning experience made me recognize the value of life; even at the age of six.  As I matured and grew older, I began to understand the valuable lesson that my father had taught me: use big arms.  I knew that I would have to use big arms to be successful in life.  I could use big arms to accomplish any goal that I set for myself.     My interest in medicine as a career grew as I watched my mother, a pediatric radiologist, at work.  I remember going to the hospital with her on weekends as a young child and watching her interpret x-rays.  When I entered college I decided to test my interest in the medical field.   The Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program for freshmen and sophomore students at the University of Michigan was my foray into the world of research.  I learned to do data analysis, prepare written reports, and present findings at research seminars.    I took premedical courses as an undergraduate, and found that I had to alter my approach to studying from what I had developed in high school.  Once again I found that I had to use big arms to adapt to a new learning style at the University of Michigan.  I investigated different majors and finally chose Brain Behavior & Cognitive Science due to my interest in the psyche and human nature.   Two years ago as a member of Medical Education Service Opportunities, a volunteer organization that provides medical services to underserved communities in Latin America and the Caribbean, I had the opportunity to participate in a medical service expedition to the Dominican Republic.  There I was given the chance to interview and diagnose patients under the supervision of a volunteer doctor.  Patients suffered from such conditions as parasitic infections, anemia, malnutrition, diarrhea, and dehydration.  The first day of clinics was one of the most anticipated days of my life.  When we walked into the church full of Spanish speaking women and children my heart sank as it seemed like all eyes were on me.   For the next eight hours I treated many sick women and children.    It was the first time that I consistently awoke with a feeling of sheer excitement and energy.  This was the point when I realized that being a doctor was the correct choice for me, and since then I have not looked back.          As I mentioned earlier when I began at the University of Michigan I had to alter my study techniques to be successful.   In hindsight I simply did not do enough.   I isolated myself and failed to seek help from outside sources.   As a result of this my grades suffered throughout my undergraduate career.   It wasn't until it was too late that I decided to seek help.  This took big arms for me to come to the realization that maybe I could use additional help.   What we found was that I was suffering from attention deficit disorder which helps explain why I was putting so much time into my studies but just not seeing the results that I wanted.    After spending time this summer conducting my own independent research, I have developed study strategies which I believe will be the most effective for me.  Up to this point my education has been a journey.  I have learned a lot about myself and I am now more aware than ever of my strengths and my areas for growth.  One of the most important things I have taken away from dealing with this situation is that there is always room for one to learn and improve.   I have recently begun the Special Masters Program in Physiology at the University Of Cincinnati College Of Medicine.  I see this program as an opportunity for me to show I am capable of performing well in an academically challenging setting.                  Attending Medical school is the next step in pursuing my lifelong dream of becoming a doctor.  Ever since that day in the ocean with my father I have been using big arms and will continue to do so to guide me through life's challenges.  I will use big arms to reach out to those in need and become the very best doctor that I can be.

    "text": "A 70-year-old man undergoes open heart surgery for a myocardial tumor and recovers well, but requires a second operation to remove an infected region in his lung. Complications mandate another operation and after four weeks in the intensive care unit, his family must deal with the decision to withdraw life saving support. An active 80-year-old woman has severe arthritis requiring two knee replacements with devices that did not exist 10 years ago. She struggles with the decision to proceed given her age. Both scenarios describe real-life experiences of members of my family.  In each situation, the relationships the doctors established made these decisions manageable.  The relationships these physicians formed with my family allowed them to assist in the decision-making and highlighted for me the role developing relationships with patients and their families plays in being an excellent physician.  In both instances, family members needed a sense of understanding and empathy on the physician's part, as well as the genuine desire by the physician to make sure those involved were comfortable interpreting medical terminology. Ultimately, I recognized our family saw these physicians not only as medical care providers, but as approachable individuals with whom they could discuss their hopes, fears, and questions.  The ability to form these types of relationships is a crucial skill for aspiring doctors, and I am grateful to have had experiences in my athletic career which have strengthened and developed my interpersonal relationship skills.  Prior to high school, I primarily played basketball in CYO leagues with other boys who were like me. Having come from a similar background, I was never challenged to consider differing perspectives in a significant way. This all changed when I entered high school where I was in the unique situation of being the only caucasian player on the team. This new exposure to cultural diversity allowed me a small glimpse of what a minority individual might experience.  Playing on this team compelled me to develop an understanding of the importance of seeing things through the eyes of others. My ability to relate and communicate with others has grown tremendously from this experience. Sharing hard work, team play and the joys of success on the court were made all the more special because of my ability to share them with close friends.  I gained a sense of empathy and learned a great deal about bridging differences in ethnicity and culture that will help in my dealings with those around me for the rest of my life.  My football experience has taught me similar life lessons. In high school, my football team accomplished a great deal.  Winning two league championships, reaching the state playoffs twice, and earning several personal accolades for my performance, gave me a sense of success and accomplishment. Despite these tangible victories, it has been my collegiate football career which has truly highlighted the lessons I have learned.  This past year, our team finished with a 1-9 record, falling far short of the expectations for the season, and leaving me feeling nothing but failure.  Experiencing only three victories in my college football career, I realized through self reflection that the real joy in the experience comes not from personal or team success on the field, but through the relationships developed.  Being able to share in the highs and lows of playing competitive sports makes the ride more enjoyable.  I have learned to persist through adversity, value relationships more than accomplishments, and understand that in sports, as in life, success is not always in the final score.  On a similar but larger scale, physicians must also weather the ups and downs of the practice of medicine, and understand the paramount import of the relationships they form with patients and their families.  The advances made in the field of medicine make it an exciting time to enter the profession.  The next generation of physicians will face important ethical decisions regarding the need to relate technology to the lives of their patients. Understanding the desires of patients and their families by developing strong and lasting relationships, will be invaluable in allowing tomorrow's doctors to help their patients make choices regarding their health and treatment options.  A significant component of a successful physician is one's ability to provide quality medical care, but the ability to relate to others on a level beyond medical jargon is imperative. The official medical terminology used to discuss my grandparents' conditions was meaningless to them without their respective doctors' explanations and guidance through their conditions and options. The ability to develop strong doctor-patient relationships is what separates good physicians from great physicians. Building relationships with others is important and understanding the value in those relationships built on trust and respect makes a special kind of practitioner. I hope to be that kind of physician. Admissions Fellow As a fellow in the Kenyon Office of Admissions, I will be interviewing prospective students and providing feedback to admissions directors. This information is crucial for admissions staff trying to learn first-hand about a prospective student's interests regarding his/her education. While I provide these evaluations, I also assist in recruiting those individuals who are prospective applicants and enrollees. Being a senior interviewer is a great honor, and I am proud to have been selected to represent my school., Tour Guide Being a tour guide at Kenyon College is a very prestigious position. There is an intense application process consisting of a panel interview after the preliminary cuts. I am honored to have been selected by the Office of Admissions to be a representative for my school. As a tour guide I show prospective students and their families around campus. I also act as a resource for them, providing follow-up information regarding any remaining questions they may have after they leave campus., John Rinka Sportsmanship Award Recipient Established in 1970 by friends of John A. Rinka, Kenyon College class of 1970, the Rinka Award is given annually to a male and female athlete who demonstrates consistently the values of caring, fairness, civility, honesty, integrity and responsibility in his/her daily participation in intercollegiate athletics. Furthermore, as an award winner, I was recognized for having demonstrated good citizenship outside the sports setting and for making a difference in other people's lives. Recipients are selected by the Athletic Awards Committee in conjunction with head coaches, faculty, athletic representatives, and Kenyon student-athletes. As a Rinka Award winner, I was also nominated for the NCAA Sportsmanship Award., KC-MEDS Officer Having been a KC-MEDS participant for three semesters, I decided to take on a leadership role during the spring semester of my junior year. As an officer, I am in direct contact with physicians in the program. I help to organize the shadowing opportunities for other Kenyon College pre-med students. I also work to recruit new doctors to the program. Fellow officers and I host group meetings every few weeks to allow students to share shadowing experiences and discuss current health care and relevant group issues., Varsity Football Player I am a current starter at tight end for my school's varsity football team. During preseason camp of my freshmen year I suffered a knee injury and was unable to play. The injury motivated me even more to succeed. Upon my return from rehab, I started both my sophomore and junior seasons. Our team finished 2-8 and 1-9 during the 2007 and 2008 seasons respectively. We view this upcoming season as an opportunity to right the ship and help turn the program around., Varsity Basketball Player I have been a member of the Kenyon College basketball team since my freshmen year. After the 2007-2008 season our team finished fourth in the conference and hosted a conference tournament game for the first time since the 1994-1995 season. After the 2008-2009 season, our team finished fifth in the conference and won our first conference tournament game, something our program had not accomplished since the same 1994-1995 season. At the end of the 2008-2009 season, I was elected as a team captain by my teammates for the upcoming season. We look forward to this year's season and hope to continue advancing our program., Tenure Track Position Search Committee Member I was asked by the Chair of the Mathematics Department to be one of two student representatives on a search committee for a new tenure track position in the department. Being on the committee involved attending several meetings to discuss candidates, attending candidates' colloquiums and mock lectures, and providing professors with feedback from myself and other students., Member of Pi Mu Epsilon I was elected a member of this national mathematics honor society at the end of my sophomore year by professors in the Mathematics Department. Kenyon College's chapter in the honor society is the Pi Chapter of Ohio., Research Assistant I worked as a research assistant in the lab of vascular surgeon, Dr. Matthew Eagleton at the Lerner Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. The focus of our lab was to examine the influence of specific proteins in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Little is known regarding the biological pathway of AAAs, however it is accepted that multiple mechanisms are at play in the degradation of the aortic wall. We hypothesized that a family of proteins acting as transcription factors, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT proteins), are an integral piece in furthering our understanding of aneurysm formation. By evaluating varying levels of the STAT proteins we hope to better understand the complex pathobiology of AAAs., KC-MEDS Participant Kenyon College Medical School Experiences Designed for Students (KC-MEDS) is a student-run organization of Kenyon pre-med students, which aims to provide participants with clinical experience during undergraduate years. Participants are assigned to shadow various local physicians with different specialties based on interest. I shadowed several doctors including an orthopedic surgeon, a family doctor, and an ophthalmologist. I was able to sit in on routine checkups and surgeries. I spent three semesters as a participant and was able to shadow three doctors each semester. Meetings were also held every few weeks to discuss shadowing experiences., Lindstrom Award Winner This award is given annually to two freshmen and two sophomore students who are hand-selected by professors in the Mathematics Department for demonstrating excellence in the classroom. I received the award at the conclusion of my sophomore year., Distinguished Academic Scholar This four-year academic scholarship is awarded to applicants who display academic achievement, leadership potential, and accomplishments in activities. As a recipient of this scholarship, I was considered in the top 10 to 15 percent of admitted students. As a scholar student I have maintained above a 3.5 cumulative GPA during my three years at Kenyon College., Kenyon Student Athletes Group Member/Treasurer This student-run organization consists of student-athletes, coaches, and teachers hoping to help bridge the gap between academics and athletics. We host meetings every few weeks to discuss current issues involving our sports teams and ways in which to get ourselves and other athletes involved in several community service projects around our campus and community. At the end of the 2008-2009 academic year, I was elected treasurer of the organization for the 2009-2010 academic year."

    "text": "My life has been defined by a relentless desire to push myself to try new things, pursuing my passions even when that meant taking big risks. At the age of sixteen, I applied for a highly competitive national scholarship to attend the United World College in New Mexico, leaving my family in Mexico City and the opportunity to train with Mexico's national gymnastics team. Despite not speaking English, I threw myself into my classes and activities, serving on student council, representing UWC at peace conferences in Canada and the USA, and obtaining the highest mark on my IB Extended Essay. When I received the Davis Scholarship to attend Colby College, I challenged myself further: graduating in three years, studying abroad at the University of Melbourne, and writing an honors thesis in neuroscience, which I recently submitted for publication as first author under the title, Mifepristone Decreases Depression-Like Behavior and Modulates Neuroendocrine and Central Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenocortical Axis Responsiveness to Stress.  As a volunteer teaching literacy in Santa Cruz Positos in rural Mexico, I learned that if you want to help somebody, you have first to understand them and be willing to learn from them. I was fifteen years old and assigned to work with Pedro, age 60, when I suggested that he could learn to read and write. He looked at me with skepticism and disapproval, shutting the door in my face. Nevertheless I continued to visit him, working on his farm and learning more about his background and his personal interests. He gradually began to demonstrate trust in me, and one day he asked me to teach him to read and write. I learned from Pedro that I can only begin to help others when I truly understand their situation and remain humble enough to always be open to learning. As a doctor, I will always remember Pedro as I strive to help my patients, knowing that I can only treat them effectively when I recognize how their unique situations define their illnesses and the approach I will take in treating them.  During my volunteer rotation at Cincinnati Children's Hospital in January 2007, I discovered the excitement of clinical care. While examining patients, I frequently drew connections back to my academic studies. On my first night on call, the ER informed the resident and me that a five-year-old girl, Tabitha, had been admitted due to severe dehydration. Based on her clinical history, I instinctively thought about the anterior hypothalamus and its role in regulating thirst. After morning rounds, the team met to conduct the differential diagnosis of all our patients, and despite my lack of sleep, I felt empowered and eager to offer ideas for a potential diagnosis, that a hypothalamic tumor could be responsible for her adipsia. I felt the adrenaline rush similar to the sensation of standing on the balance beam in gymnastics, sure of my abilities and exhilarated by the pressure of the situation. At Tabitha's differential, as the team listened to my ideas and suggestions, I felt nervous but capable, a part of a team dedicated to helping her.  A routine volunteer position at the University of Cincinnati in the winter of 2007 quickly developed into my passion for research. After volunteering at the Stress Neurobiology Laboratory of Dr. James Herman, I obtained a paid fellowship to develop my own project in his lab during the summer, a project which grew into my senior thesis at Colby. During my senior year, I received the Linda K. Cotter Award to complete my thesis research at Dr. Herman's lab. As I acquired technical laboratory skills, I learned what it means to be a scientist: the long hours, the process of designing an experiment, the challenge of facing failure and still pushing forward, and the need for collaborating with colleagues. For my hard work, I received the Ruth and William Silen, MD Award from Harvard University when I presented my research at the New England Science Symposium in April 2008. Since graduating, I have conducted further experiments that have resulted in abstracts for two neuroscience conferences and prepared my thesis for publication. My experiences at UC and Colby led me to Dr. Christina Williams's lab at Duke University where, in addition to being the lab manager, I lead a research project that investigates the effects of BMP-9, an important protein involved in the development of the cholinergic system, on reducing the memory decline associated with aging.  Throughout my life, people like Pedro, Tabitha, and Dr. Herman have taught me to always seek out challenging opportunities to learn by asking difficult questions of myself and others, both academically and socially. As a doctor, those lessons will continue to inspire me to feed my intellectual curiosity, serve with humility, and dedicate myself fully to my work. My experiences have reinforced my conviction that perseverance is vital to the success of any ambitious project, and that I find the greatest satisfaction and reward when relentlessly pursuing my goals, whether spending long nights on call at the hospital or countless hours in the laboratory. With compassion and an unrelenting work ethic, as a doctor I will always seek out new opportunities that will challenge me to learn every day. Volunteer at Cincinanti Children's Hospital During January 2007, I shadowed a team of three third-year medical students, two pediatric residents and the attending physician Dr. Michael Vossmayer through their rotation in general pediatrics. During our daily morning rounds, I learned the importance of taking detailed clinical histories and the need to communicate clearly and respectfully without using complicating language, especially when describing illnesses to the patient's family. Each week, I stayed on-call over night, during which time I had the opportunity to learn many different techniques. With the med students, I took physical examinations of recently admitted patients, and I was shown how to perform a lumbar puncture, draw blood, implant a catheter, intubate, and repaired an umbilical hernia.  I was thrilled by the experience of treating patients, and seeing how the hospital did everything they could to make sure each patient would get better and leave the hospital healthier. I also saw the inevitable challenges hospitals face, with patients like Sawer, a five-year-old girl in a vegetative stage. I attended pediatric seminars on various topics, from palliative medicine and medical lawsuits to specific cases where doctors' actions had resulted in the preventable death of a patient., Research and Teaching Assistant During the fall semester, I worked as a teaching assistant for Professor Kevin Rice in his General Chemistry Laboratory Course. In that role, I served as a liaison for all student concerns, including assisting students in performing weekly experiments in the laboratory, maintaining laboratory equipment, answering students' questions, and grading their weekly general chemistry assignments.   During the spring semester, in addition to my teaching assistant job, I also worked for Prof. Rice as a research assistant on a project studying the effects of carbomylating activity of the potential anti-cancer compound Cloretazine on human DNA polymerase beta, an enzyme involved in DNA excision repair. I presented my research at the Colby Undergraduate Research Symposium 2006 with a poster entitled: Expression and Purification of Human DNA Polymerase Beta as a Target for Anti-Cancer Sulfonylhydrazines.  Starting my first semester at Colby and continuing all the way through to graduation, I worked as an academic tutor once a week, helping students enrolled in general chemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry in their assignments and laboratory reports., Gymnastics From the age of six, competitive gymnastics has been a defining part of my life. Leaving gymnastics (and the opportunity to train with Mexico's national team) to attend UWC was a hard choice. It wasn't until my freshmen year in College that I began training gymnastics at the local YMCA while also coaching gymnastics to 6-10 year olds. I qualified to regionals that season, but because of a torn ACL, I was unable to compete. I spent the summer after my freshmen year coaching and rehabilitating my knee. I built a college-community collaboration between Colby and the YMCA, and in the fall of my senior year I co-founded the Colby Gymnastics Club, making gymnastics an official intramural sport. Since moving to North Carolina, I have had the opportunity to get back into practicing gymnastics at a competitive level. For the past two years I have been training with the University of North Carolina Gymnastics Club and with a local club (TAG) and I am now training to represent Mexico at international competitions. In April of 2010 I competed at the Mexico Gymnastics National Championships and placed top ten. This summer I have been training to increase the degree of difficulty of my skills in order to be in the top five and get invitations to international competitions during this spring., Associate in Research I am responsible for the designing, organization, and implementation of experiments related to the grant entitled: Juvenile Protective Factors for the Prevention and Treatment of Hippocampal Aging. The goal of my project is to test the hypothesis that BMP-9, a protein important in the modulation of the hippocampal neurogenic activity, will prevent the decline or cause a recovery of hippocampal function in rats, as determined by assays of cholinergic markers, neurogenesis, and cognitive performance. My first task was to write and submit a protocol to the IACUC, explaining the experimental procedures and full scope of the study. I received training from our collaborator Dr. Blusztajn in performing stereotaxic surgeries to implant mini-infusion pumps in our animals and ensure chronic intraventricular delivery of BMP-9. In the fall of 2008, I began piloting this study with ten rats, and I am currently analyzing the data that I gathered this past year. In addition to my work as a research associate, I function as lab manager, responsible for overseeing all purchases and laboratory expenditures for principal investigator. I also assist a graduate student in her research and mentor two undergraduate students in their senior thesis., Summer Teacher I spent the summer after I graduated from high school teaching with Breakthrough Collaborative in Cincinnati. I taught two sections of 8th grade science to rising eight graders from disadvantaged schools in the Cincinnati region. I also taught two elective courses, Beginning Spanish and Mexican Folkloric Dance. For each of my classes, I carried all the responsibilities of a teacher: writing lesson plans, assigning homework, managing classroom discipline, and conducting academic evaluations. Teaching with Breakthrough gave me the opportunity to engage some of the challenges of inequality in America while at the same time developing my own leadership style in the classroom., Honors Thesis in Chemistry and Awards I submitted and defended my senior thesis for the completion of my major with honors in Chemistry entitled: Investigating the Central, Hormonal and Behavioral Effects of RU486 after Acute Stress; The Abortion Pill as a Potential Antidepressant. This thesis was done in collaboration with Dr. Herman's stress neurobiology laboratory at the University of Cincinnati. I applied for and received the Linda K. Cotter award to fund my research during January 2008 at Dr. Herman's laboratory toward completing my thesis. I presented a poster both at the Colby College Undergrduate Research Symposium 2008 and at the New England Science Symposium 2008 where I received the Ruth and William Silen, MD Award with Honorable Mention from Harvard University. The poster was entitled: Mifepristone Reduces HPA-axis Responsivity and Increases Neuronal Activation in Prefrontal Cortex Following Acute Stress. The conference aims to encourage minorities, particularly Hispanics, African Americans and Native Americans, in the biomedical research field.  It intends to promote career development, and to expand their professional network. I found the opportunity to interact with other Hispanic college, graduate, and medical students who are also interested in the biomedical field, very rewarding., Summer Research Fellowship in Neuroscience I was awarded a summer research fellowship at the University of Cincinnati to work at the Stress Neurobiology Laboratory of Dr. James P Herman, in which I had previously volunteered in January of 2007. After writing a research proposal to Dr. Herman, I designed and implemented the pilot stages of a research project investigating the efficacy of RU486 (the morning after pill), a potential treatment for psychotic depression, in mitigating the endocrine and behavioral response to stress.  We tested our hypothesis in rats. This project grew into my senior thesis. During my time in Dr. Herman's laboratory, I worked with postdoctoral associate Dr. Matia Solomon on studies related to the effect of chronic stress on the development of depression in females, focusing on the membrane estrogen receptor GPR-30. I began working on this project with Matia in January, and continued throughout the summer, learning many new laboratory techniques. I was trained to work with radiation, and I performed ovarectomies, immunohistochemistry, brain perfusions, vena cava blood draws, brain extractions and hormone injections., Poster Presentations My collaboration with Dr. Matia Solomon at Dr. Herman's laboratory at the University of Cincinnati has led to the submission of two abstracts with Dr. Solomon as first author and me as second author for two neuroscience conferences.  Our first abstract entitled, Sex Differences in the Efficacy of Mifepristone in Modulating Depressive-Like Behaviors and HPA-axis Responsivity to Stress, was presented by Dr. Solomon in poster form at the annual conference of the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences in April of 2008. The poster was awarded with the New Investigator Award. The second abstract is entitled: Sex Differences in Depression-Like Behavior in Forebrain Glucocorticoid Receptor Knockout Mice and Dr. Solomon and I will present that poster at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in October 2009.,  Research Associate, Academic Scholarships United World College Through a nationwide selection process with more than 500 applicants, I won a full merit scholarship to study at the United World Colleges. The criteria for selection include academic excellence, citizenship, leadership, athletics, social responsibility, maturity, and a demonstrated commitment to international relations. I was one of only ten students selected. UWC is a network of 12 schools around the world, which brings together students of different nationalities, cultures, and ethnicities together. Aged 16-20 and representing over 80 countries, the students all enroll in the International Baccalaureate Diploma program, while interacting with classmates, teachers, and administrators from many countries.

    "text": "In high school, I applied to two guaranteed medical school programs. I received an interview for one, but was accepted into neither. Some might comment about how nice it was that I knew what I wanted to be so early in life; there are, after all, many people who have yet to decide on a career by their college graduation. Yet, in retrospect, I was not yet ready for the commitment of medical school, and those two rejections led me to experiences that make me a much better candidate.  In tenth grade, I wanted to be an advertising executive. It was the result of a sudden obsession with art, the first activity I truly enjoyed that my parents did not sanction. My mother, in fact, viewed it as a waste of time that detracted from my academics. My father was less negative, but instead presented it more pragmatically: what were the chances that I would be one of the few people who could make it in the art world, instead of just being another starving artist This sentiment was reflected by my friends. Only one of the five good friends who took art with me even applied to art school. As I used career matching sites and college search engines, I amused myself by inputting art as an interest, along with science and medicine. (Only one career came up: medical text illustrator. I knew it was not for me.) After matriculating at MIT, I figured my interest in art would go the same way as my interest in diving: abandoned for the crime of being too impractical for real life.  Yet, as the months went by, I discovered that was not so. In the spring semester of my freshman year, I found myself joining my dormitory's annual musical theatre performance, Next Act. I had never acted before, but some friends also joined, so I figured, why not During my audition, I found out that they hadn't found anyone to design the set yet, so I volunteered for the position of Art Director. And, while the set that I created was certainly not worthy of Broadway, I still receive compliments on it two years later. Next Act taught me that non-academic hobbies and interests are indeed as important as academics; while it was stressful, especially the week before the actual performances, it was quite possibly the most fun I had all freshman year. More importantly, it reminded me of why I loved art so much: because of my skills, the audience was willing to let go and believe that Belle was singing in her village or sitting in the castle library, instead of on a stage in a college dorm.  It reminded me of Pablo Picasso's quote: There are painters who transform the sun into a yellow spot, but there are others who with the help of their art and their intelligence, transform a yellow spot into the sun. For me, this quote says while some painters focus on the act of painting, others view the act of painting as merely a tool to accomplish something more extraordinary. I felt that through my art, I could help people escape stresses in their lives - that for two and a half hours on a Friday night, they were not thinking about the next problem set or test, but instead were simply enjoying the show, a rare occurrence at MIT.  Many would say an artist is vastly different from a doctor. I thought so too, until one afternoon during my patient escort shift at the Massachusetts General Hospital. It was a busy afternoon, so the family I had been sent to help had been waiting for half an hour and were very disgruntled. The situation was exacerbated by a long wait at the pharmacy to pick up medication to be taken later that day. For the duration of our encounter, I simply followed our training: I chatted with the patient, made sure she got water when needed, and helped her family get food at the cafeteria. As they climbed into their car, they smiled and thanked me. As I was wheeling the wheelchair back to the storeroom, I realized that though volunteering and art differed greatly in terms of method, their greater overarching goals were still the same: to improve the lives of others, on however small a scale.  My experience volunteering at the hospital has trained me in patient etiquette, but, more importantly, it has made me realize how welcome a kind word or smile can be in the stressful environment of the hospital. Once I was asked to escort a patient to the Patient Advocacy department. She told me, distressed, that she had been put into a room in the ER, and then was left alone for hours while others who had arrived later were helped first. Though I could not presume to know all the facts about the situation, in that moment, I was eternally grateful for the Urgent Care doctors at MIT Medical, who are always kind and not visibly harried, even in the middle of flu season. I always feel that they were genuinely invested in helping me heal, rather than simply doing a job.  This incident reminded me very clearly of what I want to do after becoming a doctor. It reminded me that doctors do not exist just to heal people's physical ailments, but that rapport and communication were just as important. This perspective was what was missing from my applications four years ago, when I applied more at the encouragement of my parents than due to my own desire to be a doctor. I think my deeper understanding of patient needs would make me a much better doctor now. Patient Escort Volunteering at Charles Mass General Hospital As a patient escort volunteer, I help patients discharge themselves from the hospital at the end of their stay, and aid them in getting to their mode of transportation.  Often, patients don't have friends or family who are able to help them home, which I feel makes my task very necessary.  I really enjoy interacting with and talking to the patients while volunteering, and always feel very lucky to be able to volunteer at the hospital., Next Act Musical Theatre Art Director As the Art Director of Next Act, an annual musical theater production put on my my dorm, I designed and created the set for the production during my freshman and sophomore years, when we put on the musicals Beauty and the Beast and Once Upon a Mattress.  I treasure my time working with other students on the shows, which were a very welcome creative break from schoolwork.  Though it was slightly stressful right before the production, some of my best memories at MIT come from being involved in Next Act.  During my freshman year, I also played flute in the pit orchestra and acted in the production, but had only very minor roles., MIT Bakers Club President and co-Founder During my junior year at MIT, I founded a baking club here with a friend as interested in baking as I was.  We held two main categories of events: bake sales, to raise money for charity, and workshops, to teach other students how to bake.  Through the bake sales, we have raised money for the St. Francis House in Boston, Horizons for Homeless Children, the Somaly Mam Foundation, and the MIT branch of Camp Kesem.  (Donations were on the order of $300 per charity.)  We also held various themed workshops to help people learn to bake, or to give students a chance to bake in the middle of the school year as easy stress relief.  I find it really amazing when people at the workshops are wowed by their own undiscovered baking skills., Next House Desk Worker During my sophomore year, I started working as a desk worker in my dorm, Next House.  The job mainly involves making sure residents are able to receive packages and mail in a timely fashion, as well as to provide general information to residents.  As a desk worker, I also deal with small emergencies that happen to the residents, e.g., locking themselves out of their rooms., Undergraduate Research in the Hammond Lab During my time in the Hammond lab, I worked with Zhiyong Poon on his project to use linear dendritic polymers as drug delivery vehicles.  These polymers will form micelles under the correct conditions, which can be chemically altered to present ligands to the surrounding environment.  These ligands can induce cellular uptake, allowing the possibility of targeting the micelles to cancer cells specifically.  My role in this project was to help run experiments to optimize conditions, e.g., finding optimal loading conditions, release profile, etc.  After working in this lab, I feel that I understand better how longer-term academic research works, while enjoying the project's unique blend of organic chemistry, biology, and chemical engineering., Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center Lab Technician During the two summers (2006 and 2007) I spent in Dr. Damaser's bioengineering lab at the Cleveland Veterans' Affairs Medical Center, I learned a lot about how research is conducted.  The project to which I was assigned established the feasibility and practicality of creating an implantable probe to measure bladder volume.  I am very thankful for my time in this lab, as it taught me many basic skills and protocols that allowed me to understand and achieve more easily the tasks that my professors at college set me.  I still follow many of the protocols today in my current research lab., MIT Student Financial Services Staff Assistant I worked in the Student Financial Services office as a campus job for my freshman and part of my sophomore year.  It allowed me to learn a lot about the financial aid and student employment systems at MIT, and I enjoyed that while working at my job, I helped others find jobs of their own., Transform Pharmaceuticals Internship My summer internship as part of the Analytical Department at Transform Pharmaceuticals showed me how research in industry works.  I investigated the prospective use of hydrophilic interaction chromatography as an alternative or secondary method of checking compound purity, first attempting to replicate results from literature, then using company-synthesized compounds to see how it would work in a practical application.  HILIC was eventually deemed impractical for the purposes of the Analytical Department, much to my disappointment.  However, this experience reminded me that, by necessity, research does not always reach a satisfying conclusion, and that such conclusions are still helpful in indicating where to go next., Private In-Home Tutoring of a High School Student Since freshman year, I have tutored Lara, a girl from Cambridge, in high school subjects including Mathematics, Biology, and Chemistry.  Despite being uncertain about the position at first, I really came to enjoy tutoring and mentoring Lara.  I felt like I was imparting some of my enthusiasm for science onto someone else.  Lara's mother told me that after she met me, she became much more interested in science - enough to apply to MIT for college as well, though unfortunately she was not accepted., Next House Executive Board Starting September 2008, I became an elected representative of my wing on the dorm executive board.  I was responsible for using the allocated wing money to purchase appliances and plan study breaks for the wing.  In February of 2009, I was elected to the position of Vice President of Relations in the dorm.  I work closely with the rest of the exec board to improve the mental, academic, and social lives of the members of the dorm by planning social events, running the room lottery, and representing residents' views to administrators.  For me, being on Next Exec is a way for me to give back to my dorm, especially since I feel that the previous executive boards have done so much for me as a student., Association of Taiwanese Students Member To me, being a member of the Association of Taiwanese students means that I have a family here at MIT.  Though I am not Taiwanese myself, the city I was born in is geographically near Taiwan, so a lot of the foods and traditions are similar.  I love being able to attend events where I know I'll get food reminiscent of home, like congee at Xifan Sundays.  Though I am not a member of the executive board, I also greatly enjoy helping out at miscellaneous club activities, like the Cooking Workshop."

    "text": "Khoda-bi-amorzesh- I was six years old when I first heard this Persian phrase. Unsure of the phrase's exact meaning, I looked to my mother for an explanation. My mother's loud cry was the only explanation I received that day. My father was dead. While leaving the construction site of a dam near the northern Iran-Iraq border, my father received a head injury in a car accident. Due to the lack of necessary medical care, he was rushed to the nearest hospital in Tehran, hundreds of kilometers away, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. As a six year old, I struggled with the concept of death. Furthermore, I was troubled by the knowledge that proper medical attention could have rescued my father's life. Wanting to prevent other families from experiencing my family's loss, I aspired to become a physician.    Though I irreversibly lost a parent, I gained a purpose in its stead. I attended school eagerly in pursuit of knowledge that I hoped would enable me to save the lives of people such as my father. For eight years, I placed faith in the Iranian educational system and its emphasis on reciting texts with little room for analysis and discussion. To my disappointment, I realized that the carefully censored Iranian curricula carried out an agenda of government propaganda with little room for independent thought. Unsatisfied with the educational system, I derived strength and courage to look for an alternative from my mother.  My mother, previously a full time housewife financially dependent on her husband, had become the sole provider of our family after my father's death. Intent on providing the very best for my brother and me, she taught day and night classes as a professor of computer science. In spite of the strongly patriarchal Iranian society, my mother retained her integrity and skillfully managed her new role. Inspired by her bravery and unyielding persistence in the face of countless obstacles, I decided to leave my family and move to the United States in search of a better education.  At fifteen years of age, I was far away from all that was familiar. I was immersed in a foreign culture and a new family, but determined to become a physician. Having once been conditioned to blind acceptance, I now embraced the opportunity of individual thought. In addition to learning new subjects, I spent the remainder of my high school years looking at familiar topics in a new perspective. Hoping to further develop my individuality and to explore the medical field, I subsequently enrolled in The Ohio State University. During my first two years at the university, I worked at the department of cardiothoracic surgery where my experience as a laboratory assistant familiarized me with the hospital setting and directed me towards undergraduate research. Thus, in the beginning of my third year, I joined Dr. Gustavo Leone's laboratory and researched the E2f transcription family, a gene family involved in cell cycle regulation. While I found my experience enriching and relevant to the topics covered in class, I longed for an experience with more personal interaction.  Before spending the summer at Camp Heartland, a camp for children affected by HIV/AIDS, I had visited its facility through alternative student breaks and had been an active member of the Students for Camp Heartland group on campus. Even so my previous interaction with the organization could not have prepared me for the summer. Instantly after arriving at camp, I was overwhelmed by its nurturing atmosphere.  Camp Heartland provides the children with a shelter after a year of coming face to face with serious issues such as poverty, parental drug abuse, gang violence, HIV/AIDS, and the social stigma of the disease. Fearing rejection, many of the campers remain silent about their status in the outside world; however, at camp they find many ears eager to listen to their voices. Listening to their stories, I found myself surrounded by friends. My father's death, my mother's encounters with discrimination, and my own fear of rejection due to my sexuality, brought me closer to understanding my campers' experiences and the true value of Camp Heartland to the children. Though I enjoyed the responsibilities and challenges of being a cabin counselor, I am most grateful for the lesson that I learned from the camp's founder, Neil Willenson. His tireless efforts in providing summer camps for my friends prove that every one of us is capable of improving the lives of others. I am marveled by the miracle of modern medicine that has enabled my campers to grow into young caring adults and I hope that in my pursuit of medicine, I am able to improve the quality of my friends' lives.   As I consider my motivations for medicine, I am reminded of my journey from Iran to the American heartland. The circumstance of my father's death inspired me to pursue a goal of providing aid to those without access to medical care, yet in critical need. My mother's perseverance gave me the courage to retain my integrity. Ultimately, Camp Heartland taught me that even I, just one individual, am capable of making a difference in the lives of others. I continue my pursuit of medicine so that I can improve the lives of humans such as my campers by giving them the hope of a tomorrow. Alternative Winter Break After visiting camp heartland as a participant in the previous spring, I decided to return as a trip leader. My co-leader and I attended several training sessions where we selected our group, made travel arrangements and were equipped with conflict resolution strategies. At Camp Heartland, our group carved out signs, painted walls, and maintained the main facility. Because of cutbacks at Camp Heartland, the housekeeping staff was let go; and so, our group worked in the kitchen, cleaned the facility, and shoveled snow in addition to our other activities. As a leader, I was responsible for keeping the group focused on the task at hand, providing topics for discussion, and ensuring that my group members had an opportunity for reflection. I enjoyed practicing my leadership skills especially in a familiar setting. In addition, I found my own experience as a team member to be very useful in anticipating the group's needs. After visiting Camp Heartland as a trip leader, I decided to become more actively involved in the camp's program., Alternative Spring Break Along with nine other students, I volunteered at Camp Heartland during an alternative spring break trip. In one week we were able to complete a wooden wall, paint some of the walls of the main building, and relocate the camp's library. I found the physical labor rewarding and very different from my daily life as a college student. Though we spent mornings and evenings sanding down walls and painting, after dinner we had the opportunity to learn more about the camp's mission and HIV/AIDS in general. As a member of the team, I participated in group activities and discussions. My experience introduced me to HIV/AIDS advocacy and was the beginning of my involvement in Camp Heartland., Riverside Methodist Hospital Volunteer As a volunteer at Riverside Methodist hospital, I participated in a number of different activities including many hours of volunteering as a Patient Advocate. The task of a Patient Advocate is to ask patients about the quality of their stay at the hospital including questions about the health care professionals' treatment of the patient and the patient's understanding of the medical decisions being made. I spent the majority of my time as a patient advocate on the oncology floor. During my experience, I spent many hours talking to patients and their families. Blessed with good health, my experience as a Patient Advocate enabled me to come to a better understanding of the patient perspective of medicine. Especially after patient complaints about the behavior of the physicians, I realized the importance of treating patients as humans and not as test subjects. I spent a total of 35 hours at Riverside Methodist Hospital during which I also registered patients, delivered flowers, and put together registration packets., Free Clinic volunteer As a volunteer at the Physicians Free Clinic, I had the chance to work in the company of physicians who dedicate a few hours each Monday in order to offer free medical care. As a volunteer, I entered patient information in the database, organized patient charts, and gathered basic medical information from the patients. My experience at the clinic was particularly enjoyable because of the opportunity to converse in Spanish with the large number of Hispanic patients. Though I am not qualified to translate for the patients, I assisted them with registration., Students for Camp Heartland I became a member of the group after returning from Camp Heartland and had the opportunity to experience the Journey of Hope where speakers shared their stories about living with HIV. I was inspired to take a more active role in the group and so I became the vice president of the group. As the vice president I represented the group at the student involvement fair and planned group activities. Our group seeks to not only fund raise for Camp Heartland but also to raise HIV/AIDS awareness. On the night of Halloween, we raised $1200 during an event called Trick or Treat for change, where we asked the generous members of Clintonville, a neighborhood of Columbus, to donate any amount of change to our cause. Furthermore, on world AIDS day we placed posters with facts about HIV/AIDS and a list of anonymous testing sites in student residence halls. We also distributed pamphlets with general facts about HIV/AIDS at the recreation and physical activities center. In February, our group was one of the student groups invited to the Red Party where we gathered to raise HIV/AIDS awareness and to fund raise for the Columbus AIDS task force. Currently I am the president of the group. I hope to continue the events of last year and to bring Journey of Hope back to our campus., Student Researcher I joined Dr. Gustavo Leone's laboratory in the autumn of my junior year. During my time at the lab I had the opportunity to apply many of the concepts I had learned in class, which included preparing agarose gels, running Polymerase chain reactions, and immunostaining. At first I was assigned the task of staining for mitochondria in hepatocyte tissue samples but over time I took on the responsibility of harvesting organs. The lab focused on studying E2f gene family, which consists of six different genes. I was responsible for harvesting organs from E2f1 and E2f3 knock out mice., AED Ethics Discussions I joined the Alpha Epsilon Delta premedical society for the opportunity to participate in ethics discussions which covered topics such as abortion and euthanasia. In addition to our biweekly discussion, I enjoyed the opportunity to listen to medical students and physicians talk about their daily experiences. It was through Alpha Epsilon Delta that I began volunteering at the physicians free clinic., Boys Cabin Counselor I volunteered at Camp Heartland as one of the two male counselors responsible for the adventure program. The adventure program, which is designed specifically for fourteen and fifteen year old teenagers, is based on the philosophy of teamwork, challenges, leadership and service. Therefore the weekly schedule includes activities such as the high ropes course, canoeing down the St. Croix River, over night camping trips, mentoring younger campers, participating in a free sex talk, and nightly devotions. The nightly devotions are opportunities for the children to reflect on their experiences from the day's challenges to their daily challenges at home. I realized the importance of Camp Heartland from my camper's stories during nightly devotions and decided to travel to California to volunteer as a counselor. In my four weeks as a counselor, I was responsible for the daily schedule of twenty-six young men. In addition to my responsibilities as cabin counselor, I was also responsible for maintaining the facility and working in the kitchen. Because of the budget cuts, the previous summer was the first time that the entire staff was hired as volunteers. With only ten days of training, we were able to offer four camp sessions to over 250 campers. I am honored to have been a member of the Camp Heartland Team., Laboratory Assistant My position as an assistant in Dr. Benjamin Sun's lab was through the work-study program. The lab's research involved ventricular assist devices, which were used to reestablish cardiac function in sheep with induced heart failure. In the lab, I maintained instruments, prepared surgical packets of instruments and suture, and prepped the OR before surgery. However, my experience was not limited to the lab. I often visited the hospital where I delivered pharmacy drug orders, dropped off instruments for ethylene oxide sterilization and visited the department of cardiothoracic surgery in order to deliver paperwork. On many occasions I was able to observe surgeries and over time I assisted in surgery by preparing the OR and handling supplies. In my time at the lab, I watched Dr. Sun perform several surgeries on the test subjects including the installment of a left ventricle assist device. With training, I was given access to the animal storage facility and on several occasions I was responsible for looking after the sheep shortly after surgery. During my time in the lab, I realized that medicine, especially surgery, not only involves the doctor and the patient but also a whole team of professionals who work behind the scenes to make surgeries possible., Honors Student The honors college at The Ohio State University is often compared to a smaller university within the metropolis of Ohio State. As an honors student, I was able to enroll in honors section of many courses including general and organic chemistry. I prefer the honors sections because of their smaller size and more in depth review of the course topics. In addition, the opportunity to take honors classes has enabled me to befriend a group of motivated and ambitious students since my freshman year at the university. I hope to graduate from The Ohio State University with honors., Persian Language Club The primary objective of the group is to foster an environment where Persian-speaking students are able to practice their language skills and get familiarized with the Iranian culture. As a fluent Persian speaker, I had the opportunity to converse with other Persian-speaking students and to keep in touch with the culture of Iran., MLK Day of Service To commemorate the life of Dr. King, each year on Martin Luther King Day the Serv Team at the Ohio State University, offers daylong volunteer opportunities. The day starts at 8:00am with a gathering of volunteers and speeches from several speakers. Around 10:00am the volunteers are driven to the volunteer sites. I had the opportunity to volunteer at the Franklin Park Conservatory. At the conservatory, I spent a few hours, removing dead leaves and cleaning the exhibits. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of tending to tropical plants, not only because of the labor, but also because of its uniqueness."

    "text": "What is truly unique about a being a Physician  After all, are there not many fields which help people in public service  Are there not many fields which are able to work towards healthcare  Physicians embody a very specific job description with very specific duties and abilities that has appealed to me and that is why I want to attend Medical School \tFrom a young age, I grew up in an extended family full of physicians (16 to be exact).  And although they varied in specialty everywhere from Radiology to Cardiology to Internal Medicine, they all had a few things in common, which I took note of.  Physicians, with their medical education, are gifted with a very specific, and more importantly, practical set of skills.  With the ability to diagnose and treat problems of the human body, physicians are in the very unique position to provide a truly extraordinary and essential service to others.  That is to say, the practicality and necessity of what they are able to do is truly matchless.  And I think the practicality of what physicians do is really what drove me towards being interested in attending medical school.  When thinking about my future role in society, I've always been fascinated by the utility of what physicians do and how important their niche in society is.  It is with a real sense of candor and a pragmatic reality that I want to dedicate my next few years to studying something that is not only absolutely essential to others, but also unbelievably gratifying to me.    \t  \tSecondly, what I truly believe being a physician allows me the opportunity to be in the healthcare field is a leader.  Within a hospital for say, there are many tiers of healthcare providers and all of whom have their skill sets and responsibilities.  And I feel that physicians are often instrumental in tying all of these together and really being the leader in this environment.  Throughout my many volunteering, working, and interning experiences, I have been able to get a good feel of where exactly doctors fit in.  The fact is that people depend on doctors not only to make the right decisions regarding patient care, but also to guide the workflow of a hospital.  Throughout my high school and undergraduate career, I have made sure to train myself to become a leader in the future.  Through various organizational and creative positions, I have developed my communication skills and confidence to someday, professionally, become an effective and charismatic leader. \tAnd finally, one of most influential experiences I had throughout my undergraduate career was my internship at MedPats in Singapore.  One of the reasons that I chose to apply for this internship is also one of the reasons that I am applying to medical school; I want to be part of the change that medicine needs and will eventually undergo.  MedPats creates a platform that brings physicians and patients together from all across the world and does so via Medical Tourism, Telemedicine, and cost analysis.  My internship there was one of the greatest learning experiences in my life and with the perspective I have learned there, I want to combine my efforts with the perspective of a physician.  I think that with these two skill sets, I can truly be part of something great in terms of bringing change to the way the world practices health care.  It is no secret that health care is not as accessible as it should be and that there is a terrible misappropriation and distribution of resources and opportunity.  After learning more and doing a considerable amount of research of my own, I really do want to be on the forefront of policy alteration to make basic healthcare available to the masses.  After all, access to reasonable healthcare is certainly something that everyone should have the right to, not just the wealthy. \tWithin the constraints of this composition, I have highlighted some of the important descriptions of what being a physician means to me.  And although this only scratches the surface of why I want to attend Medical School, I feel that these are some of the most essential of characteristics. University of Cincinnati Official Tour Guide As a part of the University's Admissions Department, I gave weekly tours to prospective University of Cincinnati Students.   I feel that this experience gave me a lot experience in meeting and interacting with new people and also developing my communication and delivery skills.  ROAR is one of the most prestigious and sought after organizations on campus and is represented by some of the most talented students at the University.  Given my great passion for my school and commitment to its interests, I felt that being a tour guide was great way to develop my skills and represent my University., MedPats Internship Singapore During the summer of 2013, my Internship in Singapore has been a great experience.  I was offered a position at MedPats which is a start up Global Healthcare management company which offers many services to expedite medical tourism and finding quality healthcare for patients from all over the world at hospitals that are the best fit for them.  I selected this internship not only to live abroad in Singapore for an extended period of time, but also to fully understand the medical-business world and create some experience before I pursue the MD/MBA program at the University of Cincinnati., Alpha Epsilon Delta Charter During the very beginning of my second year at UC, a few friends and I had an idea to develop nationally recognized pre medical honorary for our school.  We then stumbled upon Alpha Epsilon Delta, the most nationally recognized pre medical honorary in America.  We created by-laws, delegated positions, recruited, organized our events and essentially created a new organization from scratch that was in correspondence with the National Organization's rules and regulations., Cincinnati Children's Research My research at Cincinnati Children's was my first research experience and I began it during my freshman year at College.  I worked in an immunobiology lab under a graduate student who was completing her PhD.  My project culminated in a Poster Presentation at UC's Annual Undergraduate Research Symposium.  My research entailed evaluation of aging vs young immune systems and a possible cause to a discovered trend in the accumulation of immunosuppresive Treg cells in the spleen tissue of aging mice.  After learning and using various lab techniques such as flo-cytometry, ELISA, PCR, and Electron Microscopy, substantial spikes in the Il-2 (necessary cytokine) were observed in serums of older mice., Microbiology Bioremediation Research My research at the EPA was very important for my career and essential in improving my understanding of certain aspects of Biological Sciences and the research world.  My work dealt with the integration of bacteria in place of chemicals in order to remove heavy metals from the drinking water supply, namely arsenic.  As some bacteria have been identified to oxidize heavy metals naturally (oxidation the essential step for removal from solution), their use in water purification is a much cheaper and ultimately less hazardous method to improve the quality of drinking water.   My research at the EPA was also important to me as it led to my first national publication in science."

    "text": "Ever since I was nine years old and first vocalized I wanted to be a doctor, people have been asking me the inevitable question, why When I was nine, the answer was usually limited to I want to fix peoples booboos and ouchies. Though the underlying idea for that answer has not changed, my experiences in high school and college have cemented my passion for medicine.  Deciding what you want to spend every day of your adult life doing may seem like a daunting question to some, but for me it was a no brainer. I always felt that as a doctor, I would have the opportunity to not only satisfy my intellectual curiosities but to also utilize and apply all the knowledge I have amassed for one ultimate purpose: to help improve and save peoples lives.      The other amazing aspect about medicine is that no matter where you are in the world, your role never changes. I have had the opportunity to shadow doctors in not only the United States but also London and India over the past few years. Though their specialties and training may have differed, at the end of the day their job was the same; to help their patient in every way they can.  Some doctors had more time in the operating room while others had more direct patient interaction. Their patients varied in age and severity of conditions but they all shared one thing; they were human beings who needed their doctors help to understand and fix what was wrong with them.  \tIn high school I got a taste for what a career in medicine would entail. Through my AP science classes and volunteer experiences I realized how interesting science really was. Whether it was biology or chemistry, I loved learning about the mechanisms behind bodily processes. I was amazed to discover how complicated and yet well orchestrated the human body was. I was simply fascinated! Subsequent volunteering exposed me to the amazing clinical applications of science as well as the compassionate and caring side of medicine.       As I progressed into college, my dedication to medicine became even stronger. I became progressively aware of the strides the field of medicine was making.  Amazing successes in the field of organ transplantation, gene replacement therapy, and intervention cardiology has further enamored me. I want to be a part of this march that is continually transforming peoples lives.      Through my volunteering and shadowing experiences I have had the privilege of working with many talented and dedicated physicians.  Most notable was the time spent with Dr. Reilly, a hand surgeon in the Cincinnati area. In the operating room, I stood in awe with him as he explained each surgery step by step. Not only did he tell me what he was doing but also the reasons behind it, the possible causes for that particular issue, and why surgery was the best option. I also was touched by his amazing bedside manner. Despite his long hours in the operating room, before each surgery he would take the time to allay the fears of the nervous patients with a tremendous amount of positivity and confidence. He helped put them at ease while explaining again what the surgery would entail and how their recovery should pan out. I was deeply impressed by his professionalism; he inspired in me the desire to be a hardworking, dedicated, and compassionate physician.      My experiences shadowing doctors, the science classes I have taken, and my time volunteering in hospitals over the past few years have built upon my innate desire to be a physician and have solidified my decision to go to medical school.

    "text": "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome involves a variety of abnormalities. It is mainly characterized by the underdevelopment of the left ventricle, resulting in critical aortic valve stenosis or atresia with concomitant and variable degrees of hypoplasia in the other left heart structures.     I tried to follow along what Dr. Morales was telling me as I looked at the diagram depicting the small babys heart. The diagram appeared completely different from what I had  previously studied. Virtually no left ventricle existed at all. The part of the aorta that was connected to the tiny left ventricle was very narrow. Oxygenated blood from the left atrium was going back into the right atrium. The pulmonary artery was connected to the aorta, serving as the channel for systemic blood flow. I had no idea that congenital defects could exist to this severity. Moreover, I did not think that anyone, let alone a tiny newborn, could survive anything like this.      While congenital heart defects are quite rare in general, in the world of congenital heart defect correction we tend to see a lot of hypoplastic left heart patients. We normally correct this defect by a three stage surgical procedure. Due to this patients abnormally small size however, we are going to use a hybrid technique, avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass that could pose a risk of neurological damage. Instead, we will use a combination of minimally invasive and surgical techniques to palliate the patient.     Nurses began prepping and anesthetizing the tiny 2.2-pound baby. My eyes widened with fear as I looked at the tiniest newborn I had ever seen. There is no way a baby that small can tolerate a procedure like this, I thought. I expected that I was going to shadow a completely hopeless case. How wrong was I.     Dr. Morales began to dissect the sternum of the small baby boy to gain access to the heart. Normally, this procedure involves a saw, but this premature babys sternum was paper-thin and instead small surgical scissors were used. Next, Dr. Morales bilaterally dissected out the pulmonary arteries and created an incision. This allowed Dr. Goldstein, the interventional cardiologist, to place a stent to ensure that the artery stays open. Dr. Morales next placed bands on the sides of the pulmonary artery. This restricts blood flow to the lungs so that more blood can be sent to the body. After, Dr. Goldstein placed a catheter with a balloon at its end through the septum between the atria into the right atrium. The balloon was inflated and pulled back into the septum to enlarge the opening. Now, the top two chambers are connected and there is thorough mixing of the oxygen. I was in awe as I watched the procedure, trying to memorize every step I had just witnessed. Rivaling the gracefulness of a lyric dancer, Dr. Goldstein and Dr. Morales hands corrected the infant's defects with a variety of surgical and invasive techniques.     I want to make a difference in people's lives as a career. The problem was I did not know how I would make that difference. Would that career be social work Counseling Maybe spirituality, given my interest in philosophy and metaphysics But it wasn't until the first time I shadowed thoracic surgery that I knew surgery would be that career. Cutting is curing. The surgeon is the difference. A surgeon's  operation can make an immediate impact and that's what I love most about surgery. The amount we can do to the human body never ceases to amaze me. Removing organs, repairing them and transplanting new ones in like nothing ever happened! After this spring and summer, my interest has taken new heights. As a thoracic surgery research assistant, I have gotten much exposure to surgery and interventional medicine, even at times getting hands on experience in the catheter lab and the animal research OR.  I have gotten the opportunity to work on many research projects in the field of cardiology and thoracic surgery and in the process have learned much about the current research topics and issues in medicine, data collection and analysis, literature review, statistics, and case report writing in the clinical setting. The experiences have even allowed me to submit publications of my own.     Later that night I watched the NBA playoffs on TV--my favorite way to unwind after a long day of shadowing. This particular game was intriguing. Have you ever watched a basketball team come back after being down by 30 or so points Everyone writes the team off but in the last quarter a star player ignites a run that gets the team going and once again gives the team a shot at winning. Even after excellent initial hemodynamics after the procedure, the patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome that I shadowed in the OR likely will not make it in the long run given his very severe circumstance. But Dr. Morales and Dr. Goldstein have still given that patient a chance at life. The surgeons and specialists are the players that give their team a chance, any chance. After countless hours of shadowing in the OR this past year, I know that I want to be the player that does his best to keep his team in the game, because that, to me, is what medicine is about. Pre-medical Honorary Alpha Epsilon Delta is the pre-medical honorary on campus. Students have to apply to the honorary and maintain a GPA requirement. The club aims to stimulate an appreciation for pre-medical education, provide a network for pre-medical students and educators, and get students involved in charity. A major charity that our honorary frequently volunteers at is the Ronald McDonald House. Our honorary has biannual conventions, linking premedical students from all across the US. It was a great experience for our chapter, as the convention was filled with many medical seminars and sessions that informed us about the current hot issues in the healthcare field., Lab Assistant in Hematology and Oncology As a lab assistant, I got hands on experience on bench research. My lab focused on using mouse models to investigate the specific metabolic and signaling pathways that are involved in the formation of brain tumors. During this experience, I learned PCR analysis, mini prep, and other lab techniques and skills required to maintain a lab. I also worked extensively with Microsoft Excel and Word to update our database., Physician/Surgeon Shadowing in the Heart Institute As a research assistant in the Heart Institute, I also got the opportunity to shadow cardiologists and surgeons on patient cases and research projects. I often shadowed cardiothoracic surgery cases in the operating room and interventional cardiology cases in the catheter lab. Many times, I shadowed surgeries on the animal projects we have going on in our labs as well. I often got a chance to help the surgeons on these animal surgeries, by providing them sutures and cutting, holding, and even tying some of the threads to keep tissue together., Secretary of University Funding Board As a University Funding Board member, I am responsible for allocating student life fees to student groups so that they have the funding necessary to hold events and conferences for students. Each student group must submit a budget request before receiving funding. There are many considerations that go into funding a budget. For example, we check if the event or conference is relevant to the student group's mission. We make sure that the event is open to all members of the student body, as the funding is taken from student life fees that all students have to pay. We manage the groups and make sure that they spend only up to their $ 7000 allocation., Treasurer for Asian American Association As treasurer of the Asian American Association, I was responsible for financial strategy, reporting, record keeping and fundraising. Because of great financial planning, Asian American Association was able to put on the largest Indian dance competition in Cincinnati's history which was a huge success. Fundraising projects that I was involved with was the collaboration with many local businesses. These businesses donated cash to our organization with each purchase that was made on select days that were meant to benefit our organization., Caducea Caducea is the pre-medical club on campus. This club brings a physician or surgeon every month to come and talk to students who are interested in medicine. The club also provides information that may be useful and pertinent to students who are preparing to apply to medical school. It is also a place where students from all allied health fields can socialize and network. The club also provides learning through experience, as past activities have included going to the surgical amphitheater and also visiting the cadaver lab at UC College of Medicine., Cardiothoracic Surgery Research Assistant I am a research assistant who assists medical researchers on current projects and developing new ideas for projects. We primarily run statistical analyses on clinical data to test hypotheses. The conclusions we draw from our results have implications in the clinical setting. I am involved in writing case reports, doing retrospective analyses of clinical data, and assisting in prospective studies in the animal lab by obtaining materials for surgeons to allow them to smoothly complete the surgery. The major topics I have learned about are congenital heart disease, mechanical circulatory support, heart and lung transplantation and tissue engineering, particularly valve replacement surgery., Violin I initially played violin in middle school and high school in the orchestra. However, I never pursued playing any solo pieces or ever had private instruction despite my interest in the violin. After a couple years of hiatus from the instrument, I decided to get private lessons from an instructor in our musical college at our university. I really enjoy playing the violin and it is now a regular hobby I practice., Hospital Volunteering I would volunteer during school breaks at Good Samaritan Hospital. I would mainly escort patients to wards and from their beds by assisting them in getting up, moving and wheeling them around. The volunteer's role went beyond this because the experience required interaction with many patients who were either about to have operations or had just had one done. Many times they would need someone to talk to and so a big part of our job was providing a comfortable environment in a place that is often associated with negativity., Independent Project The peak flow meter is an important tool used in the management of asthma. It is used to measure the peak expiratory flow rate. I conducted an experiment in 50 children in my area to determine whether peak flow varies with body position, as the guidelines for the Diagnoses and Management of Asthma recommend that the peak flow meter be used in standing position. My results showed that position of the subject does not affect the peak expiratory flow rate and that males demonstrate a higher peak flow than females. This was an important conclusion because clinically, allergists require the patient to be standing, but in many cases it may be inconvenient for the patient to do so."

    "text": "Pain - throbbing pain - in my intestines. At the age of 12, I was on my first trip alone to India to visit my extended family. Unfortunately, by that time I had developed an irrational fear of airplane toilets, thinking they dumped their contents over oceans during mid flight. So, naturally, I feared that if I flushed the toilet, I might get sucked out of the plane at over 500mph. My brilliant solution  holding in any urges to use the bathroom for the duration of the 13 hour flight.  8 hours in, the pain was all I could bear and I mustered the courage to use the toilet, wishing myself a swift and painless end to misery. However, after resisting the urge to go for an extended period of time, I had come down with self-induced constipation. I knew the next five hours would not be pleasant. Fortunately, a flight attendant noticed my severe discomfort as I sat doubled down in the airplane seat and took the initiative to call for a doctor on board the 300+ passenger plane. Sure enough one appeared. He calmly took note of my situation and then sourced some laxatives from our fellow passengers. Looking back, my family finds the story quite amusing if not a little telling about the perils of commercial flight, but to this day I still vividly remember that doctor - specifically, how much his help was a relief to my pain and how cleverly he navigated such a unique environment. This was when I first started thinking about how remarkable physicians are; they are really intelligent and creative people who make a living serving others!  Arriving in India, though, did not signal the end of my learning. Soon I noticed a very different world where skinny malnourished arms of adults are outstretched begging for alms and dirt covered, bare foot children rush foreigners for coins to buy food. What I soon realized was that for the last 10 years I had been completely unaware of how more than 2 billion people on this planet live  day to day  road to road  hand to mouth. I knew there had to be a solution to this suffering, but why was there nothing effective in place Why do people just walk past and ignore this poverty It was only much later that I realized that in a country of one billion people it is quite hard for any, one person to make a significant dent in the situation, and that many have come to deal with this experience every day by eventually desensitizing oneself to the suffering. But there was something innately unsettling to me about simply shutting off my emotions to cope with the situation. It was during this thought process that my wish to help others became a larger life goal  to work in a profession where I could meaningfully alleviate the suffering that I saw. And I saw this possibility in the medical profession. Though, I had one more aspiration now; I wanted to help people both on a personal one-to-one level and also on a massive multinational scale where I could impact millions of people at a time.  Fortunately, I found my answer at the intersection of medicine and business. If I saw a problem, then why not build the solution! Thus, over the last few years I have been looking for issues and forming startup businesses in the fields of healthcare and nutrition, and luckily one of these ventures has begun to blossom recently. After researching food scarcity and clinical nutrition, I started my company Nutrafil with the premise that food is merely a set of tasty nutrients. Working with nutrition PhDs and practicing MDs, we developed a powder form meal replacement product to completely satisfy the nutritional needs of an average 2000 calorie diet for less than a dollar a day. The hope is that we can make the process of getting nutrients so cheap that we can eradicate the concept of malnutrition in the developing world, and so far we have made some great progress! Having secured venture capital funding, we are setting up a case study in rural India via a partnership with an existing government funded nonprofit that feeds millions of school children every year. It is this kind of large scale action that also motivates me: I want to make huge positive impacts on society and find new technological applications that can dramatically better peoples lives, and a medical education would provide me with the tools and insight into the healthcare industry as well as the medical knowledge necessary to create these new solutions. It would be so emotionally fulfilling to know that this education I would be gaining could down the road make a very real difference in the lives of people around me.  Ultimately, I want to go to medical school to become a doctor and affect change at an individual level; to be that kind and talented doctor on the plane and have the skills necessary to improve the lives of the kids I saw in India. But, I want to take on today's healthcare and poverty challenges at a systemic level too. Thus, I also want to go to medical school to acquire in-depth medical knowledge and patient experience that I can leverage into new ideas and innovations that act at a larger scope. In doing so, I hope to make a positive dent in both my society and the world. Fisher College of Business Healthcare Clusters Currently in a two part program at the Fisher College of Business where the first semester is focused on learning about multiple aspects of the healthcare industry from industry leaders working at Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane, Cardinal Health, Nationwide Children's Hospital, James Cancer Hospital and OSU Wexner Medical Center.  Second semester, 3 students and I will be working on a process improvement project at the James Cancer Hospital to create a best in class, patient centered discharge experience that will reduce potentially preventable, unplanned readmissions. This project is apparently one of the highest priority goals in the organization and is monitored by the Board of Directors., Shadowed Multiple Medical Professionals Dr. Sashi Vora, Internist and Cardiologist 7/08-4/09 Observed consultations regarding issues ranging from gout to ECG readings.  Dr. Arvind Shah, General Surgeon 6/09-8/12 Observed procedures such as hernia repair and laparoscopic surgery to remove Gall Bladder.  Dr. Juan Crestanello, Cardiothoracic Surgeon 09/12 Observed an 8 hour open heart surgery to replace patient’s aortic valve.  Dr. Niranjan Shah, Pathologist 3/13-4/13 Observed pathology lab operations., Summer Internship Abroad in Hong Kong During the first part of this past summer I lived in Hong Kong and worked at Baxter International, a Fortune 200 healthcare company specializing on products to treat hemophilia, kidney disease and immune disorders. There I worked in the finance and sales divisions to design more efficient workflow processes and write algorithms to coordinate pricing among business units, customer segments, and products/services. But while I was there, I fell and got stiches, so I experienced the Hong Kong healthcare system firsthand. Ultimately, living in a foreign country, learning a new language, making new friends, as well as negotiating a foreign health system was an exciting and memorable adventure!, Summer Internship at a Health Tech Startup in California During the second half of this past summer I lived in the heart of Silicon Valley while interning at “Simplee” a health tech startup. Simplee streamlines the revenue collection cycle for medical providers while boosting patient engagement by creating a much better electronic billing experience. My role at the company centered on marketing and business development. I contributed to their content marketing by writing white papers on the patient financial services industry and on the business development side I pitched to Chief Innovation Officers at multiple hospital networks, engaged directly with customers, contributed to the sales pipeline, and represented Simplee at health conferences., Volunteering at Local Hospital From 6/08 to 6/10, I volunteered at the Emergency Medicine Department at the Dublin Methodist Hospital. There, I restocked medical supplies such as syringes, needles, and oxygen tanks as well as linens and warm blankets to help the place run smoothly.  From 8/11 to 8/12, I volunteered at the Geriatric Department at the OSU Wexner Medical Center. I interacted with patients and attempted to bring some of the outside world back into the patients’ lives by reading books and talking about news/sports in order to offset confusion that can set in during long hospital stays. It was quite interesting to hear the stories that the patients had to tell about their past!, Longboarding I enjoy longboarding (a type of skateboarding) for leisure and transportation, since it is great way for me to introspect while traveling long scenic routes and getting in fresh air at the same time. I am also active in The Longboarding Club at The Ohio State University, where we organize fun events like a 15 mile charity marathon we did last April benefiting Mattea's Joy, a non-profit organization committed to supporting families with critically ill children., Finance Internship at UBS Financial Services I interned at a wealth management firm to gain a better understand of investing, financial planning, retirement benefits, and insurance protection. I assisted by conducting research on specific securities and markets in order to best advise clients. I also helped organize informational events for potential customers, including one event for orthopedic surgical residents where we explained common financial pitfalls a lot of new doctors make after starting their careers and how to avoid them. I found this very interesting and thought it was an incredibly valuable service that UBS offered for free to these residents., Startup Development In addition to Nutrafil, in my free time I work to get the following projects off the ground:  Co-founder at Doctr.io – a startup focused on aggregating and organizing data from an assortment of wearable devices and then performing analytics on them in hopes to deliver new personalized health insights and trends.  Investor Relations Officer at Looky.co – an ecommerce website targeted towards bringing social interactions to the Chinese online buy-sell marketplace (i.e. Facebook meets Craigslist for China).  Chief Operating Officer at Trucky.co – a startup based in San Francisco developing mobile apps for real time tracking of food trucks and delivering current information to customers., Financial Advising at Scarlet and Gray Financial Over this past year I have been volunteering and helping run The Scarlet & Gray Financial Clinic which is part of The Ohio State University’s Student Wellness program. At the clinic, I provide one-on-one financial advising for a variety of clients including students, faculty & working professionals. I help them work through financial issues they may be struggling with including: banking basics, budgeting, credit cards, debt repayment planning, financing college education, student loans, understanding retirement/savings, understanding credit report/score and many other topics. I also mentor younger coaches to prepare them for future clients and run the program after I graduate., Cancer Radiation Therapy Research Studied how resonance x-ray frequencies on injected heavy metal nanoparticles destroyed DNA base pair linkages in order to find a more efficient, effective and safer x-ray radiation therapy. When starting this project, it was quite shocking to learn that x-ray therapy has not really changed since its invention over 100 years ago and that much of the x-ray spectrum is harmful rather than helpful to the patient. This meant to me that concrete findings in the project could lead to significant changes in the administration of x-ray therapy, but there are still practicality issues associated with targeting cancerous cells accurately with injected nanoparticles that need to be overcome., Entrepreneurship - Co-founder & CEO of Nutrafil LLC Working with several nutrition PhDs and MDs, I started a company called Nutrafil and developed a powder form meal replacement product that aims to completely satisfy the nutritional needs of an average 2000 calorie diet for less than a dollar a day with the focus towards supplying charity and governmental organizations in the developing world and disaster relief efforts with low cost, high impact nutrients that do no spoil and taste delicious. We have secured venture capital funding as well as advisory from an executive at Abbott Nutrition and are currently setting up a case study with an existing government funded nonprofit in India called Akshaya Patra that feeds 1.3 million kids daily."

    "text": "I have always secretly wanted to have supernatural powers. When I was little, I admired heroes like Superman as well as magical witches and wizards from different worlds. Although it would be completely amazing to have those abilities to make life easier, this was never the aspect of these fictitious characters that I envied the most. No matter where they came from, all these characters struggled with their identity until they came to the realization of their extraordinary gifts. Their powers completed them as heroes, but it was their character that completed them as individuals who could save people from any villain or disastrous event. Bluntly stated, this is what I have always wanted, some gift in me that will define who I am and help me make a difference. \tI have discovered several attributes about myself through various experiences in the medical field that support my aspiration to go to medical school. For one, I find medicine exciting and gratifying. While observing a live birth at McCullough-Hyde Hospital, the nurses advised me to sit down because of the graphic nature of the process; however, I was not at all phased. In truth, it was one of the most incredible things I have ever witnessed. On the other hand, I have come to know that medicine is not always filled with happy endings. I completed a preceptorship through Miami University in which I shadowed an emergency department physician in Indianapolis. On one shift, an older woman was rushed in with multiple organ failure. The nurses and doctors reacted instinctively and efficiently as they attempted to resuscitate her, but unfortunately she died about an hour later. It was especially difficult watching the daughter's face of pain and disbelief as her mother passed away. Taking these experiences together, I feel like I can handle the tenuous aspects of medicine while still appreciating the miracle of life. \tI have never been one to give up on a person who has come to me for help. For this reason, I started volunteering at the Community Counseling and Crisis Center, where I answer anonymous phone calls. My experience there has showed me people's problems are always important, even if you cannot imagine yourself in their specific situation. Whether it is necessary to talk them out of hurting themselves or giving relationship advice, the connection made with people over the phone is real. But even more than just wanting to help people solve their emotional problems, I hope to understand their physical problems as well. My opportunity to do research in health psychology has demonstrated the importance of constantly asking questions. Attending conferences with my research group has showed me that finding solutions to these questions through the scientific method can lead to answers that directly benefit people. \tFinally, I have come to think of myself as a person who works well with other people. I work as a patient care technician (PCT) in the heart and vascular intensive care unit (HVIC) of Miami Valley Hospital. The nurses keep me busy helping to assist multiple patients at once. However, the thing I enjoy most about my job is the patient interaction. There is something very powerful about helping someone when they are at their greatest need. This belief became my reality as I was assisting another PCT clean up an incontinent patient at the hospital. This was a woman who had recently lost a lot in her life, and was embarrassed by the situation. She apologized profusely as we went through the routine process and assured her it was going to be okay. When we finished, she grabbed my hand and said, You must be an angel. It continues to amaze me that small moments such as this make my whole job worthwhile. \tEach of these experiences and characteristics I have discovered about myself has solidified my decision to go to medical school. Before choosing medicine, I struggled to find a place where I belong; however, now it has become part of who I am. Perhaps being defined by some awesome superhuman ability is too obviously unrealistic. I have grown up and realized medicine clearly suits my strengths. It is how I plan to do my part and make a difference. Because in all honestly, whether it is Superman or a physician, everyone needs some sort of hero. Rosa Parks Elementary Tutor As a volunteer for Adopt-a-School, I traveled to Rosa Parks Elementary in Middletown, Ohio on a weekly basis. Through this organization, I have tutored both first and third-grade students in reading comprehension and writing. Personally, interacting with the students in each class was very enjoyable and made tutoring something I anticipated every week., Discussion Leader During my sophomore year, I was a discussion leader for an introductory psychology course at my university. In the semester prior to becoming a leader, I was required to take a course called Psychological Perspectives on Leadership and Pedagogy for preparation purposes. The following semester I co-led a 50-minute breakout discussion section of ten students on specific topics including correlation versus causation, falsifiability, experimental methods, and descriptive research. My other responsibilities consisted of giving participation grades and providing feedback on research papers written for the lecture portion of the course., Shadowing at St. Francis Hospital During my winter break, I traveled to Indianapolis to shadow Dr. Randall Todd, a physician in the emergency department of St. Francis Hospital. I was able to shadow three separate eight-hour shifts in which I observed his physician responsibilities and patient interactions firsthand. In addition, I was able to interact with multiple physician assistants and medical students as they completed their rounds. This experience was especially beneficial because I was able to gain new perspective and insight from people at different levels of the medical profession., Mission Trip to Peru For the final two weeks in July of 2011, I am planning to travel to Huancayo, Peru for a medical mission trip with the Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children (FIMRC) organization. Specifically, I am volunteering with twelve other students on a Summer International Health Fellowship in which we will be shadowing physicians as well as performing rotations alongside Peruvian medical students. In addition, we will be traveling to community health centers in the city and rural towns in the Peruvian highlands in order to teach people how to avoid common diseases. I am very excited for this experience, and hope it will broaden my horizons on world health care in general., Pre-Medical Fraternity Member I am a member of Phi Delta Epsilon, which is the only pre-medical fraternity on campus at my university. My duties in this organization include recruiting new members, attending chapter meetings and functions, and raising money for the Children's Miracle Network. Being a member of this fraternity has many benefits as a pre-medical student such as direct connections for premedical advice and with people who have similar future goals. Overall, PhiDE has been an excellent resource for my ambitions to attend medical school., Undergraduate Research Assistant I am an undergraduate research assistant for Dr. Rose Marie Ward, whose research pertains to health psychology. Working with Dr. Ward has given me the opportunity to conduct literature searches, assist in data collection, and perform basic statistical analyses. During my junior year, I conducted my own research study in which I examined the relationship between sleep, exercise, and alcohol habits with a transtheoretical model. Subsequently, I presented this project at the National Conference of Undergraduate Research (NCUR) in Ethaca, NY. This upcoming year, I am scheduled to present at the Conference of Emerging Adulthood in October in Providence, RI as well as at NCUR again in March., Patient Care Technician (PCT) I currently work as a Patient Care Technician (PCT) in the Heart and Vascular Intensive Care Unit (HVIC) of Miami Valley Hospital. I completed a four-week training course to earn this title. My responsibilities include assisting patients when they need to use the restroom, administering baths, supplying clean linen, and restocking supplies. Essentially, I assist the nurses with basic needs, which can be more specific to recovering HVIC patients. Another part of my job involves sitting with suicidal or fall risk patients in order to ensure they do not harm themselves. Overall, this job has provided me with many opportunities to experience medicine firsthand., Butler County Community Counseling and Crisis Center I have been a volunteer at the Butler County Community Counseling and Crisis Center since my sophomore year. Before I began volunteering, I was required to pass a 40-hour training program, which prepared for over-the-phone counseling. Typical callers of the Crisis Center include people seeking advice for their everyday problems, while some callers are also suicidal. In some cases, it is necessary to contact the police or the Consultation Crisis Intervention (CCI) if the caller is in immediate danger. As a volunteer, I am required to work a minimum of four hours per week and log what was discussed on the call, even if the caller has chosen to remain anonymous., Cincinnati Children's Neurology Clinic Volunteer I volunteered for a children's neurology clinic at the Cincinnati Children's Outpatient Center in Mason, Ohio. On a weekly basis, I would play games or color with young patients in the lobby while the doctor spoke with their parents or they waited for their appointment to begin. In addition, I would occasionally be needed to distract a young patient while the nurse administered an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) exam. This experience allowed me to have a special interaction with the families, in which they were always very appreciative of my help., McCullough-Hyde Hospital Volunteer I volunteered in the Obstetrics Unit of McCullough-Hyde Hospital located in Oxford, Ohio as a sophomore. My primary responsibilities included aiding the nursing and clerical staff with patient internal calls, passing out meal trays, and delivering lab specimens. During my time as a volunteer, I was also given the opportunity to observe both a natural birth and Cesarian section on two separate occasions. I witnessed the delivery of the placenta and postnatal care of the infants in both instances., Shadowing at Miami Valley Hospital I was given the opportunity to shadow Dr. Ouellette, D.O., a surgeon who specializes in oncology and cancer care. On my first shadowing experience, I was able to scrub in on a billiary bypass surgery for a patient with advanced pancreatic cancer. During my second shadowing experience with Dr. Ouellette, I observed a thyroidectomy and a scheduled pancreaticduodectomy (aka Whipple) surgery. During my time in the operating room, I was taught how to scrub in on a surgery as well as allowed examine the removed thyroid gland and cancerous mass from the side of patient's duodenum. These three surgeries lasted a total of six hours, two hours, and three hours, respectively., Bryan D. Wood Memorial Scholarship I was nominated for the Bryan D. Wood Memorial Scholarship as a junior at my university. I was awarded this scholarship of $1,100 for my senior year at Miami University as pre-medical student able to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.7 or higher., Undergraduate Clinical Research Practicum I was one of six students selected to participate in a clinical research practicum in the Division of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital supervised by Dr. Jannel Phillips, a pediatric neuropsychologist. Through this program, I observe evaluations of children with psychological tests such as the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), among others. In addition, I assist two different psychologists with weekly group sessions. Dr. Jennifer Currans's group is for children with severe autism, ages 5 and 6, while Dr. Stacey Morrison's group helps kids from ages 8 through 10 with learning executive skills for attention and problem solving., Dean's/President's Lists I was placed on the Dean’s List at my university for achieving a GPA of 3.50 to 3.99 for the spring semester of my freshman year, fall and spring semesters of my sophomore year, and spring semester of my junior year. In addition, I was placed on the President’s List in the fall semester of my junior year for achieving a 4.00 GPA., Center for Psychological Inquiry Tutor I work as a tutor for a student resource center in the psychology building at my university known as the Center for Psychological Inquiry. The Center was opened in the spring of 2011, and the six undergraduate students that run the Center have been responsible for making our resources available to students in the department. We have organized information sessions pertaining to graduate school and offer walk-in tutoring for any psychology subject. In addition, my personal project was to bridge the gap between being a psychology major as well as a pre-medical student. I compiled a packet of information that facilitates how to integrate the different course demands into a manageable timeline.,  Nurse's Aid/ Patient Care Technician"

    "text": "Disorientation overcame me the moment he threw me against the wall. I attempted to regain balance, but sharp pain surged through my head as a hard hit sent me plunging to the ground. Agony writhed through my back as he repeatedly kicked me and I felt warm tears of fear, pain, and anguish run down my cheeks. The pillow he had now smothered over my face with one hand muted my shrieks. As his other hand choked me, I fought for breath and remember thinking, Will I survive this time It was the sixth time I had fallen to his ruthless mercy, but, as a nave college freshman, I couldn't escape my abusive boyfriend. I was too afraid to alert the police and too embarrassed to seek help. Soon enough, his violent tendencies emerged in public and the wall I had built around myself crumbled; I had to reveal my secrets to my friends, who did whatever possible to rescue me from his control. And when they hugged me just because, cried when I cried, and held my hand through it all, I was overwhelmed with gratitude. Without them, I couldn't have emerged from my most traumatic experience without a broken spirit.  That experience not only taught me the value of friendship and compassion, but also engraved in me a deep respect for life. I realized the invaluable worth of my life and the lives of others. From then on, I felt disgusted when I heard news of people intentionally harming others. I desired to be a pillar of support for those who needed it, just as my friends had been for me. It had become my duty to pursue a career where I could preserve and promote life while serving others--medicine was the only choice.  Actually, I had already planned to be a doctor. A college physiology class I took in high school sparked my fascination with the human body. The cardiologist that saved my father after he suffered a massive heart attack earned my deepest respect, initiating my urge to save another's life in return. I was exposed to clinical settings as a hospital volunteer. Although I already wanted to be a doctor, my struggle as a domestic violence survivor defined the time at which I knew I needed to be a doctor.  Since then, I have dedicated myself to the pursuit of medicine.  To better understand a physician's manifold responsibilities, I interned at the Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center. I clearly saw what it is that doctors do during a shift when an OB/GYN realized that he needed to perform an emergency C-section on his pregnant patient. I witnessed the deep healing effect doctors bestow as the hysterical woman relaxed when her OB/GYN took her hand, looked into her eyes, and said, Your baby will be fine. I was awestruck by his ability to immediately assess the situation, decide how to mend it, calm his frantic patient and then perform a surgery--all under the threat of losing a life. I knew I wanted a career where I too could diligently do so much good under pressure.  But I saw the gritty side of the job too: long days, endless paperwork, and emotional tribulations. I learned that doctors too can be helpless. The same woman who just had a C-section was wheeled back into the OR an hour later. She was still bleeding and had contracted an infection, leaving the OB/GYN with no choice but to perform a hysterectomy.  Although he had just given a baby life earlier, he had to steal the mother's ability to give another baby life. Through this all, I still admired the doctor's grace and understanding.  My motivation also resides in a love for science and learning, and my research with Dr. B furthered my pursuit of knowledge. I gained more than just lab experience; I learned how to examine journal articles, think critically, be knowledgeable and curious, and continually scrutinize my work. After investing many hours in my lab, I appreciated how crucial basic science is to the medical field. Drugs and treatments that I prescribe in the future will not exist if no one is dedicated to finding them today. I began to love the process of discovery and was energized by the thought that my results could one day improve many lives.  I desire to not only gain knowledge, but to bestow it upon others. As a CPR instructor, I caught a glimpse of how satisfying it can be to share my knowledge with those willing to hear it. A mother once told me she learned CPR because she feared she wouldn't be able to save her child if something happened. The heart-felt thanks she gave after class humbled me and I realized how sharing a little knowledge of a life-saving skill had improved her life. My will to study medicine also stems from the possibility of improving lives by teaching others how to help themselves.  These experiences, among others, resonate deeply with my interests and goals and have given me the competence and confidence to pursue medicine. My life experiences have prepared me emotionally and mentally; I can successfully endure the rigors associated with a career as a physician. My strong academic background has prepared me to tackle the new information I must be committed to learn. I am sure in my ability to relate to patients compassionately, to be a teacher and innovator, and to enter medical school with the enthusiasm and dedication that will enable me to become an honorable physician who can truly assist the patients I care for. Member of On-Campus Cultural Organization As an active member of UCLA's ISU, I regularly attended various cultural, social, and religious events during the year, and quarterly general meetings to discuss upcoming South Asian events on campus. The biggest ISU event I participated in during my junior and senior years was the annual Culture Show. Every Spring quarter, ISU hosts a show featuring dances, musical acts and skits that displays the diverse South Asian culture. I performed in three different styles of dance between the two years I participated. Because it is a very large event that hundreds of people attend, those organizing and participating in the show spend the majority of Spring quarter preparing for it. During Spring quarter, I dedicated significantly more time to the organization, in preparation for Culture Show, than I had during the Fall and Winter quarters. I practiced with my team(s) for a minimum of five hours and up to twenty five hours per week. Even though I committed a large amount of time to Culture Show and ISU, I truly enjoyed being able to learn different dance styles, make new friends, and perform on stage in front of a large audience., Yoga At the beginning of my senior year, I became very interested in the art of yoga. I regularly attended classes offered by UCLA Recreation at the campus gym throughout the week. I found the series of stretches and breathing exercises to be challenging, but at the same time, rejuvenating and relaxing. Although yoga was physically demanding and difficult at first, I became more comfortable with the practice as I continued to attend class. I am currently taking yoga classes at my local gym and often practice at home., Tutor, Mentor, and Intern Each week, I would go to a low-income housing community through the TEACH internship. TEACH interns act as tutors and mentors for elementary school children in an effort to build strong academic goals, while developing a bond with the children in the community. Interns would visit the community site every week for two hours. The first hour was devoted to tutoring, mainly helping the children with their homework and reading. In the second hour, a predetermined pair of interns would present a one-hour long health module presentation that was geared towards teaching children about health topics and how to care for themselves. For example, one of my topics was the sense of smell and how to protect it. Each quarter, I prepared two health modules, which consisted of mini-lectures and various hands-on activities to keep the children engaged. The internship also required that I take two upper-division Medicine classes that focused on current health/health-care topics, such as child obesity or lack of health insurance, that strongly affect the underrepresented community I was working with. I was directly able to correlate the issues that I learned about in class to my interaction with the children. For example, I was able to identify symptoms of ADHD in one child I worked with after learning about it in class., Abstract Publication I am coauthored on an abstract titled, Adverse Pulmonary Effects of Mechanical Ventilation in Newborn Mice Are Prevented or Attenuated by the Serine Elastase Inhibitor Elafin. The abstract, which summarized the findings of a neonatal lung development project that I worked on in Dr. Richard Bland's research lab at Stanford University, was submitted for the 2010 American Thoracic Society Conference. My post-doctoral mentor, Anne Hilgendorff, presented the project at the conference. I will be coauthored on the full length journal article for the same project, which is currently being written and will be published soon. Also, I will be coauthored on a journal article for the project that I am currently working on in Dr. Bland's lab once it is completed in the near future., Staff Member; Local Chapter and National Organization Member I was an active member in the local chapter of AMSA throughout my four years at UCLA. I attended weekly meetings where guest speakers of various backgrounds discussed the medical field and its many professions. In my first year, I was an intern and shadowed staff members to learn what being on staff was like. In my second year, I became the Mentoring Project Director and established a mentoring program pairing premed undergraduates with medical students at UCLA's David Geffen SOM. Premed participants developed a personal relationship with their mentor and learned from their mentor's experiences to prepare themselves for medical school. In my third year, I was the Pre-Humanistic Medicine (PHM) Committee Chair. I organized two events per quarter that were geared towards helping students learn how to be strong candidates for medical school. I also oversaw the Mentoring and Newsletter Projects, and assisted the projects' directors by helping recruit new mentors and article writers and resolving any problems they faced. In my fourth year, I was the Student Life Committee Chair (formerly PHM) and continued with my previous year's duties. As a national AMSA member, I attended larger events with other national/state AMSA chapters, like the 2009 AMSA ARC Conference and the 2008 Region X Conference., Dean's Honors List I was recognized on the Dean's Honors List for my high academic performance during Winter 2007, Fall 2007, Fall 2008, Winter 2008, and Winter 2010 at UCLA., Post Office Express Supervisor I worked as a customer service representative at the Post Office Express (POE), which is located in the on-campus student union building. I was responsible for sending out customers' mail, selling postage, answering questions, and working with my teammates to continue providing excellent customer service in an often busy and stressful environment. After a year of working at the POE, I was promoted to the Supervisor position, taking on greater responsibility. In addition to my earlier customer service duties, I was now in charge of opening/closing the store, ordering supplies and packaging materials, and training new employees. I also participated in scheduling and interviewing new employees. As the supervisor, I oversaw the activities of other employees while they dealt with customers; I assisted employees when they had questions pertaining to our services or when they faced specific problems, such as trying to placate upset or impatient customers. I made it a priority to catch and correct any mistakes made so that our customers wouldn't encounter any difficulties while sending out their mail (such as having mail sent back to them due to incorrect postage). Under my leadership, the POE was able to run smoothly and efficiently, with a very high quality of service., Lobby Day In January 2009, I attended Lobby Day in Sacramento, CA with my local American Medical Student Association (AMSA) at UCLA chapter. Lobby Day was a conference at which hundreds of premedical and medical students, nurses, physicians, and other health-care professionals gathered from all over the state to lobby in favor of SB 840, the Senate Bill that proposed a Universal Health-care system for California. The first day of the conference, the attendees were broken up into small groups to learn about and discuss the bill. We were given the task of lobbying the bill to an assigned delegate in the state Congress in an attempt to get them to vote in favor of it, and we worked in groups to come up with a lobbying strategy. The second day of the conference, we marched to the capitol and rallied on its steps before breaking up into our groups to talk to our representative about the bill. It was an eye-opening and exciting experience to learn about the bill, to rally in front of the state's capitol, and to meet with a delegate in the state Congress in an attempt to improve the health-care system., Research Assistant In the summers of 2008 and 2009, I worked in the Rabinovitch-Bland lab at Stanford University's SOM, and researched the effects of mechanical ventilation on the development of the neonatal mouse lung. I worked on two different projects, one in 2008 and one in 2009, with other members of the lab. I took on a larger role in my 2009 project. Both summers, I assisted in ventilation studies, where we mechanically ventilated mice for a given period of time. I spent time learning the theory behind the projects and researching other relevant published work in order to better understand our own research. I learned how to perform common lab techniques and assays, such as DNA and RNA extractions, PCR, Western Blots, Zymograms, and Immunohistochemistry. I also attended weekly lab meetings, where other lab members presented the progress of their own projects. I was published in an abstract summarizing some of the work done in the 2008 project, and the related journal article is en route for publication. I am currently continuing to work with Dr. Bland this year and I intend to finish the project that was started in 2009. We have begun discussions with a journal for this project's publication paper once the project is completed.,  Research,  Supervisor/Customer Service, Care Extenders Internship Through the Care Extenders Internship at the Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center and Orthopedic Hospital I obtained valuable shadowing and hands-on experience in a clinical setting. I volunteered for over a year, completing more than 300 hours of work in different departments in the hospital. I worked in the Critical Care Unit, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Labor and Delivery, the Pharmacy, the Cardio-Thoracic Intensive Care Unit, and the Emergency Room. Each rotation lasted approximately three months. I had the opportunity to shadow nurses and attending physicians in each department and was able to learn a vast amount about medical procedures and treatment. I observed and assisted in procedures, such as suturing, extubations, live births and C-sections, and helped staff with tasks, including retrieving medications from the pharmacy and checking on patients. By asking questions and talking to the staff, I learned what a typical day as a nurse or doctor is like and observed first-hand what is required of a physician. I had a chance to interact with patients and their families, and was also able to learn from their experiences in the hospital., CPR/First Aid Instructor Upon acceptance into the CPR/First Aid Committee run by the Student Welfare Commission (SWC) at UCLA, I was trained and certified as a CPR/First Aid instructor by the American Heart Association (AHA). I worked with a group of fellow instructors at least three times per quarter to train and certify groups of 25 UCLA students/staff and local community members in AHA CPR and/or First Aid. The committee offers three classes (Heartsaver CPR, Heartsaver CPR and AED training, and First Aid) which are primarily based on the AHA's Heartsaver CPR and First Aid videos. Instructors were responsible for demonstrating CPR techniques on dummies, correcting and assisting students while they practiced, and expanding on information presented in the videos. I also instructed in Super CPR (the grand finale event of Bruin Health Week, SWC's largest on-campus production), where our committee certified over 100 students at one time. Besides teaching classes, I attended quarterly CPR/First Aid committee meetings and social events, as well as events hosted by other committees within the SWC. Twice every quarter, I assisted publicizing our classes by distributing flyers around campus. I would spend between one and four hours per week on CPR/First Aid depending on whether or not i was teaching a class that week."

    "text": "Amidst the students' chattering came the usual announcements of volunteering opportunities.  The Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity president once again made his plea for me and my cohorts to volunteer at the Book Thing, just as he did the week before and the week before that.  I was in my sophomore year at Johns Hopkins University and had recently become a member of the fraternity.  At the time I knew little about how the Book Thing operated, other than that it was a free book exchange, but signed up to volunteer nonetheless.  That following Saturday I headed over to the Book Thing building.  Although I had no expectations about what the place would look like or how it operated, little time was lost before I became overwhelmed.  I was not overwhelmed by the concrete floor in need of sweeping or the CD player that could not play a full song without skipping.  Rather, I had realized that although the Book Thing building was much smaller than the size of the campus bookstore, it contained literally tens of thousands of free books for anyone who wanted them.  I was even more surprised to find out that the Book Thing existed through the efforts of only a handful of people.  I had always thought that I would make a difference in the world because I was a student at a top university, but diplomas did not create the Book Thing.  For that matter, I knew nothing about the people running the Book Thing and it made no difference.  The Book Thing was successful because of the dedication to the community of those involved.  I felt insignificant as unease grew in my stomach.  My whole life had been focused on graduating from college, but I now knew that I can do great things as well without having every advantage beforehand. \tI would like to think that this experience is what pushed me into research.  I had always respected those who did research as I believe that expanding the pools of knowledge is inherently good, but had never been proactive about getting involved myself.  Later that same semester I applied for a summer research internship.  That internship would begin solidifying research as a part of my future plans.  In the fall of my junior year, I involved myself in the Build-A-Genome project.  The goal of this ongoing multi-year project is to synthetically construct, with several alterations, the entire genome for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The magnitude of the project allowed for about twenty students and five mentors and teaching assistants to participate each semester.  I learned background information and new techniques, but more importantly I developed a commitment to the project that was stronger than anything else I had ever done.  Never before had I imagined I would choose spending a Friday night running polymerase chain reactions (PCR) instead of out with friends.  With every completed chunk of DNA and as each synthetic chromosome lengthened, I grew as a researcher.  Research became something I did because I found it to be exciting, plain and simple.  It may not be exciting in the same way that skydiving is exciting, but every accomplishment brought with it a sense of satisfaction that was unique to the experience. \tThe following spring semester brought new challenges and responsibilities as I became a lab mentor.  Aside from the mundane mixing and distributing of reagents, my new duties included aiding the twenty new students with their protocols and diagnosing and troubleshooting their problems.  The students knew I was readily available to answer any of their questions and I was about to develop leadership skills which are necessary in both medicine and research alike. \tDue to my deeper understanding of the main project I was able, for the first time, to engage in truly independent side projects.  Of course, help was available if I needed it, but I managed most of the planning and protocol formation on my own.  It was during this time that I matured as a researcher.  Instead of being told what to do, I addressed problems that had never been faced before.  For one project, I was given the task of synthesizing large pieces of DNA from smaller fragments that had failed using the conventional protocol.  By changing elements of the PCR protocol (annealing temperature, polymerase, etc.) I developed over fifteen experimental protocols and was able to solve each of the troublesome DNA sequences.  I alone had made a unique contribution to the project.  What I had done was not overly complex and anyone could have done it, but nonetheless I was excited to have had it come to fruition under my efforts.  The results would be used time and time again when the standard protocol would not work.  As a physician, I will be able to use the creativity and independent thinking skills that were created from my involvement with Build-A-Genome to aid patients when the standard protocols are not good enough. \tLike the first donated book that started the Book Thing, I am at the beginning of my path to becoming a physician.  As one book became thousands, I know I can serve society by turning my passion for research into compassion for patients.  With the maturity and leadership skills gained from Build-A-Genome, I am ready to face problems in need of answers as a physician and researcher. Alpha Phi Omega Service Fraternity Alpha Phi Omega is a student organization dedicated to service and the improvement of the surrounding Baltimore area as well as on campus.  The group holds weekly organizational meetings in which planned service and fellowship events are discussed.  Requirements for active standing in this group is attendance at half of the meetings, attendance at two fellowship events each semester, and completion of a minimum of 15 hours of service., Honors/Honor Societies April 2007 - Admission to National Society of Collegiate Scholars, which is a general national honor society.  April 2008 - Admission to Beta Beta Beta National Biological Honor Society, Rho Phi Chapter - Tri-Beta is an honor society dedicated to the expansion and appreciation of biological study. Events occur approximately once a week and take a variety of forms from poster sessions to seminars., Research Publications and Acknowledgements Authorship on Submitted Papers:  Characterization of Articulation of the Lumbar Facets in the Human Cadaveric Spine using a Facet-Based Coordinate System (Mithulan Jegapragasan, BS.

Boeke), Summer Landscaping Work Every summer since 1998 I have been employed within the context of a family owned landscaping business.  Money earned is used to help pay for school expenses., Campus Job - Materials Handler For the whole of my senior year, I acquired a campus job in the recycling department.  The job consisted of driving a vehicle and picking up garbarge, cardboard, metals, plastics, and biohazard boxes and taking them to their respective receptacles.  I needed this job to pay for necessary expenses., Sports and Outdoors Activities I have been a dedicated outdoors man since I left my cradle.  I began fishing when I was about two years old and have been doing so on a constant basis ever since.  I began hunting at the age of twelve (the youngest legal age to do so in Pennsylvania) and will continue to enjoy it well into the future.    Other hobbies include rock climbing, street hockey, ultimate frisbee, and weight lifting., Shadowing Dr. Kathleen Werner (PCP) I shadowed Dr. Kathleen Werner, a primary care physician, for one work day.  I was exposed to life as a physician in private practice., Homebrewing/Brew Club In September 2008, I began learning how to homebrew beer. This hobby requires much reading to troubleshoot problems and understand the brewing process and yeast chemistry. I have brewed several styles of beer and enjoy experimenting with ingredients outside of the typical barley, wheat, and hops. Brew Club is an offshoot of my hobby of homebrewing beer. I find making beer interesting and thought other people might think so as well. Thus, whenever I would brew, I would sent out emails on various lists for anyone interested to come to my apartment and learn about the process. Attendance usually ranged from two to five persons.,  Landscaping, Sigma Phi Epsilon Social Fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon is a social fraternity with cardinal principles of diligence, virtue, and brotherly love.  On top of being an outlet for social events, the fraternity partakes in intramurals, community service, and various events on campus., Neurosurgery, Spine, and Biomechanics Research Since September 2009, I have been working full time in the Neurosurgery, Spine, and Biomechanics lab at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.  I work under Dr. Boyle Cheng (PI) and lab manager Daniel Cook.  The majority of the studies we do in the lab deal with testing medical implants on cadaveric spines, but we also pursue basic science questions.  My role has been to prepare spines for testing, aid in the testing itself and the subsequent data analysis.  Since joining the lab, I have acquired a basic proficiency in computer software such as MATLAB, ScanIP, and Osirix (latter two are imaging software).,  Spine Research, Shadowing Neurosurgeons Starting in June 2010, I will be shadowing some of the neurosurgeons at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.  I plan to shadow about 10 hours per week., Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative Summer Internship The Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative sponsors college students to work in laboratories in Pittsburgh each summer.  This research experience focused on performing various biochemical assays to determine the composition of bioengineered tissue.  In a prior study, the central vertical third of the patellar tendon was removed from a sample of rabbits.  Porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS) was used as a treatment for the experimental group of rabbits.  SIS is an extracellular matrix derived bioscaffold that, when applied to healing connective tissue, results in faster and better healing.  My duty was to analyze the biochemical makeup of the treated and untreated healing tissue and to compare the two for significant differences.  Skills involved during this internship include perfoming BCA assays, hydroxyproline assay, collagen typing assays, running SDS-PAGE gels, data evaluation, and a thorough knowledge of the patellar tendon and the concepts involved with its healing process.  Aside from work within a lab setting, students were given an opportunity to partake in various other activities such as an ethics forum and watching a brain surgery at a local hospital.  At the end of the 10 week internship, students presented their work at a poster session., Gene Cloning Work This research experience began in mid-July 2008.  It focused on the effects of using a bisubstrate inhibitor on the ghrelin O-acyltransferase protein.  My role in the project was primarily gene cloning., Cancer Research This research involves determining the role of the homeobox (HOX) genes in breast cancer.  In particular, HOXB13 is being examined.  Skills include gene cloning, luciferase assays, SDS-PAGE, Western blots, cell proliferation assays.  I was also able to observe tumor removal surgeries on mice., Build-A-Genome This research is in the field of synthetic biology and the overall goal is to construct the entire genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae.  The bulk of the work consists of synthesizing long stretches of DNA (building blocks) using oligonucleotides 60-80 bases in length.   Research involves using PCR, running agarose gels, transformation of bacteria, analysis of DNA sequences, and basic knowledge of genetics.  Time committed in the fall 2007 semester was about 15 hours/week, 40 hours/week during the four week period between semesters, and 20 hours/week in the spring 2008 semester.  During the spring 2008 semester, I was a student mentor, which consists of aiding other students involved in the research with problems, answering their questions, making and organizing supplies (such as making agarose gels), and performing various side projects in addition to the responsibilities of the regular students.  As a student mentor, the bulk of my time is used in performing side projects.  One such side project that I worked on was creating and testing various PCR protocols in order to determine which protocol is most effective in constructing correct PCR products for building blocks that have given incorrect products using the standard protocol."

    "text": "The heat was stifling as the reddish-brown dirt swirled around my ankles, sticking to my body. I learned this would be my constant companion throughout the trip. It was my first year in college and I was in Africa debating the ramifications of polygamy with a Cameroon university student. To her, polygamy was not seen as a negative because within their culture women were not allowed to say no to their husbands. Also, since many were arranged marriages, it was felt that multiple wives distributed some of the burdens of wifehood. This conversation along with other events I witnessed throughout the almost month-long journey opened my eyes to the multitude of different beliefs and cultures in Africa. It was this trip that solidified my desire to learn about the different cultures of the world and minor in anthropology. In our rapidly shrinking world learning cultural differences is important for effective communication. Anthropology will assist me in understanding why a woman might be unable to go into an exam room without her husband or how to handle a patient who does not believe in taking prescription medication. This knowledge, coupled with my science classes, clinical experience, and research in cancer at the Owensboro Cancer Research Program has prepared me to take the next step in my life: medical school. My clinical experience began early by shadowing my father, an ER and family practice physician. During this time I realized I was interested in medicine as a career. As I watched and assisted with a variety of procedures I learned the curative powers of medicine and the relationship of trust between physician and patient. In addition, my experience with my father and the familiarity with the medical field have armed me with the belief that you must truly love being a physician. The long road of becoming a physician does not end with graduating residency. The love of the human body and science in general must be coupled with a desire to treat people who, at times, do not understand the constant learning required of physicians. Watching him, I learned that there are frustrations along with the rewards; the frustration of patients not following instructions, billing processes, and politics. Yet to me, these frustrations are worth having if it means I can be a physician. In addition to my father, I have shadowed other physicians. One particular case while shadowing an oncologist has remained with me through the years. As Dr. Alkhalili and I entered the exam room, the exhausted young woman looked up with a smile. At 24 years old she had become too sick to even leave her bed, let alone dress for work. Finally agreeing to go to the doctors it was found that she had cancer which had metastasized throughout her body. Her prognosis was only a few months, but with Dr. Alkhalili's constant compassion, empathy, and continuous research she was beating the cancer months after her deadline had passed. On a personal level, my mom was diagnosed with Hepatitis C around 15 years ago; she had contracted it while working in the healthcare system in Haiti in the 1980's. The decision to wait on whether to treat my mom's Hepatitis C then or wait until better treatment became available was decided. Finally, in March 2009 the time came when my parents and her infectious disease specialist chose to begin the treatment in the hopes they would rid her of the virus. Although I was away at school for most of the year I knew about the times she spent sick with overwhelming exhaustion from the therapy. For 12 months after her treatment began my family and her doctor waited in angst for her results. As we sat on the patio of a restaurant our first night in the Bahamas this past winter break my dad raised his glass, To mom's undetectable virus load. Her success was achieved with the unforgettable help of Dr. Deery, who guided my family and me through the difficult year. He encouraged my mom to continue treatment and kept my father constantly apprised on the test results. What Dr. Deery did was more than his job - he put time, effort, and feeling into helping my mother. Watching him and my father interact with patients has reinforced my determination to become a doctor - I want my intense love of science and the human body to be coupled with the feeling that I am doing something meaningful. From Dr. Deery, Dr. Alkhalili, and my father I learned that sometimes it is simply the compassion and the support of a physician that helps patients through. Being a physician is a career where you may help people, but ultimately it is a career that tests your ability to adapt, learn and empathize. I know as a physician I will experience successes and failures and will be challenged daily, but that is part of the allure.  This career encompasses all I love: science, people, constant changing and learning, decision making and challenges me to be better. My experience with anthropology will help with the increasingly diverse patient population and my science classes, clinical experience, and research with cancer have armed me with the necessary groundwork for medical school. There is no second career for me; this is my dream, my ultimate aspiration. Habitat for Humanity Volunteer As a member of the locally run campus chapter of Habitat for Humanity International I work in partnership with people from the community to build and renovate decent, affordable housing. Since becoming a member, I have helped demolish the interior of a house for renovation along with putting up insulation around the outside of the house using donated materials., Scholarship As the valedictorian of my high school class and GPA of 3.99, I am the recipient of the Verle Klungness Scholarship of $ 17,000 per year. It is awarded to graduates of Michigan's Upper Peninsula high schools who show an exceptional academic record. To receive this I applied and was subsequently offered an interview. During this interview I was asked why I thought I deserved to receive this scholarship along with my interests and future goals.,  Assistant Manager/Waitress, Biology Honor Fraternity Beta Beta Beta is a national biological honor society that is dedicated to improving the appreciation of biological study as well as acting as a professional fraternity for these students. Each year biology majors with a certain GPA are encouraged to apply. Once selected, members also tutor fellow biology students weekly in introductory and mid-level biology courses., Mentoring For a year I have mentored at Harrington Elementary School for a girl named Haylei. During this time I tutored her in math and verbal along with helping her do the assigned homework for the day. In addition to tutoring her, we had valuable one-on-one time during which I learned about her family, her likes and dislikes, along with playing games with her once work was finished. It was during these times that I came to know her as more than a mentee and realized that people of different backgrounds and ages can make an impact on each other. When she moved to Battle Creek this past semester I chose to wait and see if they would come back, as many families often do. However, since she has not, I plan on taking another mentee this coming semester., Clinical Assistant From the age of 10 until I left for college I observed and assisted my father, a family practice physician, at the Drummond Island Medical Clinic during regular office days or called-in emergencies. During these times I watched and sometimes assisted with the treatment of common colds, suturing of wounds, removal of fish hooks, and casting of broken bones. In one instance I also went with him as the deputy medical coroner and watched as he pronounced a middle-aged woman who had been killed while snowmobiling., Honor Fraternity Gamma Sigma Alpha is a National Academic Greek Honor Society that is dedicated to the academic success of its members. In order to become a member I had to maintain a 3.5 cumulative GPA. The values of Gamma Sigma Alpha are: academic engagement in which members demonstrate a commitment to learning; congruence where members take action in supporting the academic mission of higher education institutions; striving to reach our potential in all that we do; shared goals met through involvement; developing an awareness to improve the global community; and building relationships with the community. This includes university faculty, researchers and staff who ensure the academic success of members., Prentiss M. Brown Honors College I am a member of the Prentiss M. Brown Honors Program and College. As a member I am required to take four honors courses for credit, each fulfilling a different category. The four categories are Social Science, Fine Arts, Humanities, and Science. Each of these classes is discussion based and contribution is encouraged and required.  Due to the discussion based format of the classes it is imperative to ensure that the reading for the day is done along with background research if needed. These classes are unlike lecture-style classes in that they demand your opinion and background knowledge to support your opinion. In addition to taking these required classes, I am required to maintain a minimum GPA of a 3.45.  To graduate with honors a GPA of 3.5 is required along with a senior thesis that can be completed in a subject of interest., Waitressing/management I began working during the summers at age 14 and have been working with Bayside Gourmet and Fine Dining for four years. I started as a busser and over the past years have worked my way up to Assistant Dining Room manager. After developing a thorough background knowledge on the wine and food, my job entails working as a waitress and bartender in the dining room and the banquet hall nightly. I also assist with inventory, creating the weekly employee schedule, and inventory control., Sexual Assault Advocate I underwent 35 hours of training to become a Sexual Assault Advocate and volunteer for Calhoun County. A sexual assault advocate is a person who provides comfort, knowledge, and help to people and their families who have been victims of sexual assault. We work in concert with SANE nurses (sexual assault nurse examiner), the local hospitals and the police department. In addition, since becoming certified last November I have completed 111 hours of volunteer work. Each month I am on-call for multiple 12 hour shifts during which I must be prepared to leave my current work and go to the designated hospital or police station where the sexual assault victim is located. During this difficult time I provide support, information and referrals for victims of sexual assault and abuse and their families., Volunteer Members of the Student Volunteer Bureau are responsible for supporting and supplying services to existing volunteer programs and assisting in developing new ones. These programs extend into the community of Albion, at the college itself, as well as outside of Albion. One volunteer program I have assisted with is Healthy Babies Day of Albion where parents are educated on health for their children as well as providing clothes and necessities. I also have assisted in setting up the Albion Health Care Alliance Holiday Benefit Ball and volunteered at a children's activity table during the local Festival of the Forks., Shadowing Experience Over the past 3 years I have shadowed multiple different physicians.  In addition to observing the primary care physician at the Drummond Island clinic for many years, I have also shadowed specialists. I shadowed Dr. Paula Rechner, a general surgeon and observed pre-operative care and surgical procedures including a breast reduction and colonoscopy. While shadowing Dr. Kevin Lawson, an orthopedic surgeon, I observed an arthroscopy procedure.  In 2007, I shadowed Dr. Adman Alkhalili, an oncologist/hematologist, and observed the treatment of cancer patients, orders for chemotherapy, the meaning of different lab results and overall patient care. Another specialist I shadowed was Dr. Johnathon Hakim, an urologist, where I observed the evaluation of patients' urological problems such as urinary incontinence and kidney stones., Albion College Tour Guide Management Team Since freshman year I have been a certified tour guide of Albion College. This entails leading prospective students and families through campus tours and participating in panels designed for questions from future students. This year I accepted the position to be on the Tour Guide Management Team.  The requirements for this include conducting tours throughout the year, available for a minimum of 2-3 hours per week to handle responsibilities in the Admission Office, attending monthly trainings, available to do a pre-practice tour with any trainee, act as a mentor and help train newer tour guides, along with helping to run the August Training Tour Guide Workshop., Owensboro Cancer Research Program This summer, as an intern at the Owensboro Cancer research program I am studying and researching vaccines and treatments for breast and lung cancer.  The first project is trying to develop clones of mammaglobin within tobacco plants. mammaglobin-A is over expressed in 80% of breast cancer and the hypothesis is that if the patient's dendritic cells are sensitized to this gene then the immune system will begin killing the tumor cells. The second research project is with vitamin C and 3PO and looking for a synergistic effect on the death and damage done to the lung cancer and breast cancer cell lines we use., Delta Gamma leadership positions Throughout being a collegiate member of the fraternity Delta Gamma I have assumed several positions. My first position, which I will have served on for 2 years this fall, is Director of Recruitment Records and a member of the Evaluating Committee. This position's duties include maintaining thorough records of the fraternity's potential incoming members, assisting formal and informal recruitment, informing all current members of the rules and regulations of recruitment and ensuring they follow them, and running the selection process for new members. Assisting formal and informal recruitment includes coming up with creative ideas for events, training active members in recruitment procedures and working with the recruitment president to ensure a smooth recruitment process. In addition to my position as Director of Recruitment Records I have, and continue, to serve as VP Panhel and representative of Delta Gamma on the National Panhellenic Committee at Albion College.

    "text": "Looking out my window, I scanned the crowd of parents and grandparents gathered in my back yard, cameras poised, awaiting the start of the performance. I did my best to calm the forty dancers who were lined up backstage, giggling with nervous excitement. This was the sixth annual recital, marking the conclusion of a six week dance camp I founded called Future Starz. I thought about the months of effort that went into tonight's preparation: choreography, lesson plans, costume decorations, program design...I wanted all of this effort to be reflected, and anxiously trusted the girls would perform their pieces just as we had practiced. Alright girls, are you ready I asked them enthusiastically. This is it, so have fun out there and smile! I gave each a high-five as they made their way out the door to take their places on stage.  \tAs I watched the first group's performance to A Spoon Full of Sugar, a little girl in the middle of the front row, Anna, caught my eye. I couldn't believe how far she had come. On the first day of class, four-year-old Anna, dressed in a pink tutu, hid behind her mother's legs and barely even said hello. I listened as her mother explained that Anna was painfully shy. She had hesitated to sign Anna up for Future Starz, knowing she would have a hard time socializing with the other girls. Each day I would reach out to Anna who, for the first few weeks, still clung to her mother for the entire class. I refused to give up on her, and took every opportunity to engage her to join in. Often I would ask Anna to help demonstrate a dance move, or be the line leader, tasks she hesitantly accepted, but was proud to accomplish. My persistence paid off. Throughout the six weeks, Anna slowly but surely gained confidence. By the last classes, she had become independent enough to practice without her mom, and now took center stage, leading the other girls through the dance. After the performance, Anna's parents came up to me, overflowing with pride. They could not believe the transformation they had seen in their daughter. She'll definitely be back next year! And she was.  \tI couldn't help but think of Anna as I began my summer internship as a Chester Scholar at MetroHealth hospital. Here, I was no longer in a teaching position, but now was the learner with mentors guiding me. Although I felt comfortable in the hospital setting and had previous research experience, I knew I would be expected to do things new to me. Working on a clinical study of aspirin resistance, I had to approach patients I had never met, explain my study to them, and ask them to have their blood drawn and tested. I was hesitant to bother the already busy nurses in the bustling pre-surgery room to do blood draws. Initially, I felt out of my comfort zone. But I was determined to make a strong contribution to this project. And I did. I enrolled 100 patients by the end of the summer, and found 25% to be aspirin resistant.  \tI was intrigued by the problem of aspirin resistance and wanting to delve deeper, I decided to make this the subject of my Senior Independent Study thesis at The College of Wooster. However, I soon found that bringing my outside resources to Wooster was not necessarily welcomed. When I discussed the idea with my professors, they were glad to see my passion for it, but reluctant to take on a project that was not in their particular area of research. But I pictured the patients at Metro that were affected by this problem and knew I couldn't give up. Again, my persistence paid off. Throughout the semester, I proved to my professors I was capable of doing the study by seeking advice from local and then national experts. One advancement led to another, and now I am successfully collaborating with leaders in the field of platelet physiology from Florida and Baltimore. \tWhether developing potential in a person, or solving a scientific problem, I will not quit. As a mentor and a student, I have established relationships of trust and communication necessary to tackle problems from start to finish. I would want my physician to be equipped with not only the knowledge and desire to solve a problem, but the persistence to actually do it. I anticipate challenges in medicine, but know, that for issues involving human life, the best outcome for a patient will come from a physician who won't give up. Phi Beta Kappa Academic Honor Society As a college junior, I was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Academic Honor Society on the basis of outstanding academic achievements and high standards of personal conduct., Skating Instructor, Dance Program Director at Ice Arena As a figure skating instructor, I taught Learn to Skate (Basic 1-8) to children ages 4-11 at the Wooster ice arena. This job allowed me to utilize my figure skating training to teach children skills determined by the United States Figure Skating Association. As a continuum of the dance program I founded in Cleveland, I was able to develop one at the ice rink. I taught ballet and jazz dance as a part of off-ice training to skaters participating in Learn to Skate. I attribute the success of this dance program to the previous experience I had developing and teaching a dance program in my community., Dance Team at The College of Wooster As a member of The College of Wooster Dance Team, I participated in team practice 3 days per week in preparation for performances, which took place during half time of basketball games. I also enjoyed utilizing my creativity by being a team choreographer. This experience was gained from prior figure skating and dance choreography., Volunteer for Lincoln Way Reads program As a volunteer for this program, I assist elementary students from grades K-6 in the development of better reading skills. I am paired with one student and work with them each week on reading and homework during their lunch period. It has been a great reward to see the academic progress made by the students I have mentored.,  Chemistry research,  Clinical research, Hospital Pharmacy Assistant During summer and winter breaks from college, I volunteered in the pharmacy at St. John Westshore hospital. My duties were to deliver medications to each department of the hospital, label medications, and file patient information. From this experience, I became aware of the integral role the pharmacy plays in efficiently delivering the correct medications to patients. I also gained a better understanding of the inner workings of a hospital., James Kendall Cunningham Memorial Prize Established in 1935, this prize is awarded to the pre-medical student at The College of Wooster, who, at the end of the junior year, is adjudged to be the most likely to succeed in the medical profession., Lifeguard Following certification, I worked as a lifeguard at Bay Village City Pool. I was required to have acute attention to detail, which allowed me to foresee dangers at this large public facility. The summer job instilled confidence in my being responsible for the safety of others., Chemistry research in the Sophomore Research Program I applied to and was selected for the Sophomore Research program at The College of Wooster. For my year-long project, I performed physical chemistry laboratory research on the solvent-dependent photo-degradation of PABA and ODP (sunscreen active ingredients). In the research process I learned to discover, sequence, then solve problems on the molecular level. This required careful observation, precise planning of experimental setup, and becoming familiar with instrumentation (UV Visualization and Fluorimetry). I gained a solid understanding of laboratory technique from this experience. Additionally, I learned the in-depth mechanism of sunscreen protection as it relates to skin cancer prevention., Chemistry Club (Vice-President, President) I became actively involved in The College of Wooster Chemistry Club as a first year student. The organization is nationally recognized as a student chapter of the American Chemical Society (ACS). This past year, the club was honored at the ACS national meeting where it received an Honorable Mention Chapter award by the ACS Committee on Education. The club focuses its efforts on community outreach activities, and was featured in Ohio Magazine in November, 2009 in an article entitled Outreach 101. As a junior, I served as Vice-President of Chemistry Club. In this role, my responsibilities included arranging for guest lecturers, outreach demonstrations at local elementary schools and at annual Science Day at the College, and planning events on campus to celebrate National Chemistry Week. I have been elected as President for this year, where I will direct the club., Clinical Research on Deep Vein Thrombosis I performed clinical research for a prospective study involving the detection and prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) associated with orthopedic surgery. I compared two regularly administered anticoagulants, Lovenox and Arixtra, by collecting patient data on post-operative knee and hip replacements surgeries. The data parameters ranged from difficulty of self-administration of the drug and ecchymosis to major bleeding or DVT/pulmonary embolism. I collected information through patient interviews and in-hospital observation., John W. Chittum Prize in Chemistry I was chosen by the chemistry faculty at The College of Wooster as the outstanding student in Organic Chemistry. This award honors an Emeritus professor of Organic Chemistry at the College., Clinical research in the Chester Scholar Program I was selected as a Chester Scholar to participate in clinical research in the Heart and Vascular Center at MetroHealth Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. I began a currently ongoing prospective study on the prevalence of aspirin resistance in patients with Peripheral Vascular Disease. Over a ten week period, I enrolled, interviewed, and collected and analyzed blood samples from 100 patients who qualified for the study. In addition to research, I also gained clinical experience shadowing physicians on the following services; Cardiac Intensive Care, Pediatrics clinic, Psychiatry, Neurology, Pathology, Oncology, Burn Unit, Emergency Room, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, OB/GYN, and ENT. In this county hospital setting, I interacted with individuals from diverse cultural, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds.   I was intrigued by the topic of aspirin resistance, and am currently investigating its biochemical mechanisms through a study of my own design. I am collaborating with international experts in this field through my Senior Independent Study thesis at The College of Wooster., Founder and Director of Dance Program In 2001, I founded and directed a dance program for girls ages 5-14, with approximately 40 students enrolled on a yearly basis. The program progressed from a neighborhood back yard setting to a professional studio setting rented in my community. Classes took place for six weeks during the summer months, and the program escalated in enrollment over each of its seven years of existence. There were three levels of instruction based on skill level. A recital ended the program each year, where audiences ranged in number from 100-150. I creatively introduced confidence and skills to my students, and, as pilot of the program, established a strong sense of leadership in myself., Science Scholarship to The College of Wooster The Science Scholarship to The College of Wooster was awarded to me based on academic performance and interest in chemistry throughout high school. This science scholarship was reevaluated and awarded to me each year at The College of Wooster."

    "text": "The black and white tie, borrowed from my father, holds the white, itchy collar tightly against my neck as I sit uncomfortably on the cold, mahogany bench. I can barely make out the shiny box that sits before me through these tear-stained lenses. My hand rests in my mother's who sits beside me. Her hand is sweaty and cold, but somehow it comforts me. Her eyes are blood shot, her cheeks stained with shiny tear tracks and her lips quiver; her mother rests indefinitely before her. I do not want to be here. I do not feel strong here. I do not like seeing my Grandmother, who once bounced with energy and laughter, lying lifeless in a box. As an eleven year old, I feel grown-up in this suit, I feel finite. This dark picture in front of me is a cruel reminder that cancer is heartless--the disease does not care about the pain that it causes. I wanted to help my mother. I wanted to help myself. I wanted to relieve the pain. I wanted to walk up to that box and grab my grandmother by the hand and walk with her out of this awful place. I wished that this was not happening.     The heartbreaking reality for me was that this would not be my last encounter with this awful place. Seven years later I found myself staring into my reflection in the back window of my father's car as we headed north to my grandfather's house. My image disappeared as my breath condensed on the dark window--I wanted to disappear with it. I could see my father's pained eyes in the rearview mirror as he drove through the night. The passing of his father was the first time I had seen him cry. When we arrived at my grandfather's house, my whole family greeted us. We were happy to see one another, but everyone seemed hollow--their normal bounce and enthusiasm was gone. The house felt shamefully empty without my grandfather. I wore one of my grandfather's old suites to the funeral; his lingering scent reminded me of the times he made me laugh or when told me how proud he was of my hard work in school. A man whom I respected, who pushed me to do my best in everything that I did, who loved his family unconditionally and always made their happiness his personal priority was now gone. His life was slowly taken one breath at a time as pulmonary fibrosis took its hold on him. The journey back to our Ohio home was the longest drive of my life. For most of the trip, I sat in silence thinking about how I missed my grandfather, my friend, how I would never see him again and how I wished I could have spent more time with him. I remember thinking Life is not fair.     It wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I realized just how fragile life was. The news came in the worst phone call I have ever received. The words of my tearful mother still ring in my ears, Chris, Megan has had a heart attack... At twenty-one years old, my sister was physically fit and motivated. It was the night before her graduation from university. Megan was my biggest inspiration. She graduated in the top-ten percent of her college class, she held my hand through difficulties in high school and college, and she loved her family more than anything. It did not seem fair for this to be happening to such a good person and for me to lose everything that I held dear to me. Stepping into that hospital room with my parents, I felt panicked and hopeless. There was nothing I could do to help her and that feeling was sickening. One of the happiest days of my life was the one when the cardiologist told us that Megan would be alright. At twenty-three, my sister is on medication to help fight the onset of heart disease, but she has her life...she has time...she has the opportunity to make more memories, and I selfishly take joy in the fact that some of those memories will be made with me. I owe the joy of knowing this to the physicians who diagnosed and treated her.      I still carry the pain of losing my grandmother and grandfather. I have no choice but to recall those disheartening images from their funerals, however, the time I had with them brightens the darkness associated with their death. I can walk through life, with values and talents reminding me, warmly, of the people I have loved. Each scholastic or athletic award I earned was rewarded with a phone call from my grandfather; he knew the value of education and hard work. My grandmother's artistic aptitude and talent has fallen to me. How lucky we are to have some aspect of our fate lie in genetics and principles passed along, as gentle reminders of our lineage and love.     I know that the future will bring more visits to that awful place--not just for me, but for everyone. Some will have to experience it more than others and some more profoundly, but sooner or later everyone has to wear that uncomfortable suit. I hold my head high knowing that I have the opportunity to devote my life to extending time, and the quality of that time, for others--the time needed to create the memories that lighten the darkness that we will all experience. I have not and will not take this opportunity lightly. In the end, I realize that all we have is time and memories and I wish to make the best of both for myself and others. I feel fortunate that my chosen career as a physician will give me the chance to do so. Physician Shadowing - Maimi Valley Hospital Although Miami Valley Hospital does not typically permit undergraduates to shadow within the Medical Center, after speaking with Karen Pollitt, the Resident Recruitment Coordinator, she decided she would make an exception and allow me to shadow three physicians who she knew personally: Dr. Bright, Dr. Paul Heyse and Dr. Philip Heyse. I was the only undergraduate student working among third year medical students, residents and attending physicians.  I observed eight surgeries and was involved in helping to transport patients. These surgeries included a skin graft, addition of a stint to a carotid artery, abscess removal from an upper thigh, femoral artery bypass implementation, surgical investigation of intestines, as well as, a gall bladder removal. I was given the opportunity to assist in the dissection of the removed gall bladder -- locating and removing two gallstones.  Furthermore, I observed the physicians as they counseled their patients before and after their surgeries and attended the conference between the physician and the patient's family. Following my shadowing experience Dr. Paul Heyse and Dr. Philip Heyse generously shared some of their experiences as physicians and surgeons, adding to my inspiration and enthusiasm to enter into the field of medicine., Alpha Epsilon Delta - Member As a member of Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED), the honors pre-health fraternity, I attended weekly meetings and social events with my peers, and learned more about the field and practice of medicine. As part of this organization, I had the opportunity to meet with doctors in a variety of specialties as they discussed life in undergraduate school, medical school, residency, and outside of the workplace. I also participated in a Dance Marathon, raising money for sponsored children who are patients at Dayton Children's Medical Center. As a group, AED raised the most combined funds for our sponsored children., Neuroscience Society As a member of the Neuroscience Society, I attended The Neuroscience Society Conference at the Miami University of Oxford, where undergraduate and graduate students from around the world presented their findings in genetics. The conference was an enlightening experience and was helpful in guiding me in my own research in gene expression., Honors Program / President's Scholarship Award As a student at the University of Dayton, I have received the President's Scholarship for exceptional academic performance in high school.

Not only was this a fun experience, but it also proved to be a successful one, as our team also placed second in our league overall., American Red Cross Club - Vice President As Vice President of the American Red Cross Club (ARC), I oversee ARC operations on the University of Dayton campus. I help to organize meetings, as well as recruit new members to become part of our organization. Additionally, I maintain communications with the ARC Dayton Chapter executives and attend meetings at their downtown Dayton facility to discuss the implementation of future projects. These projects are geared toward generating funds for disaster relief to help meet the basic human needs (food, shelter, and health needs) of families and individuals when disaster strikes. Currently, our club is assisting the ARC Dayton Chapter in the creation of a large scale dance competition called, Dance for Life which will offer youth the opportunity to display their dance crew's ability by performing disaster relief themed dances. The event is expected to raise money for disaster relief, as well as promote the ARC cause. I will be in charge of contacting dance studios for recruitment and general assistance in organizing the event., National Society of Collegiate Scholars During my freshman year of College I was inducted into the NSCS for being in the top 20% of my class., Bell's Nursery - Employee During the summer following my freshman year of college I worked in Bell's Plant Nursery. As a merchandiser, I was in charge of watering and organizing the plant stock, as well as assisting customers in their search for plants and flowers. This experience helped to familiarize me with specific plant names, in addition to their specific biological needs., American Heart Association - Heart Walk Fundraisor I created a website and gathered a team of participants to take part in a five kilometer Heart Walk sponsored by the American Heart Association. Our team generated $1,000.00 in donations which was given to the American Heart Association to aid in the fight against cardiovascular disease., Genetic Research - Genetic Engineering of Drosophila Under the guidance of Dr. Amit Singh, Ph.D., a specialist in tissue regeneration and genetic engineering, I am heading a personal project geared toward publishing a paper regarding gene expression and an unsolved genetic pathway of drosophila.

    "text": "Nestled in a valley fifteen minutes outside the bustling city of Jos, Nigeria sits a gathering of mud huts known as Kisayhip Village A.  Before our Volvo pulled to a complete stop at the end of a rutted path, many of the children of Kisayhip were already barreling toward the van of white strangers.  As we unloaded our crates of gifts and supplies, children swarmed around us, seemingly unaware of the rocks and hot sand under their bare feet.  Many of the children did not speak, and one of the boys seemed particularly wary of the crowd, lingering far from the growing excitement.  Dressed in a red sweater despite the sweltering African heat, he wore the facial expression of a weathered old man. His labored walk mirrored his pained face, and his yellowed pupils jumped out of dark, tired eyes.  As I watched him hobble around the village, I noticed that his bare feet were swollen to twice the normal size with no definable features except for toes that jutted abruptly from each oblong mass.  Caked in mud and dust, the bottom of his swollen feet bore wounds that served as points of entry for the parasites that filled them.  My heart sank as I realized that the condition that left him debilitated and alone could be treated. Noticing that several of the children seemed sick or pained like this little boy, one of our leaders approached the chief of the village, to ask about the children. The chief told us that his people live in pain because they do not know another way and they have no access to treatment or medical care.  My heart sank with the helpless feeling of knowing that I was not prepared to provide the treatment that this little boy needed.  Suddenly, an act that I viewed as significant, our going to the villages of Nigeria to lay the groundwork for an extensive project, seemed insignificant compared to the urgent medical needs of this boy.   It seemed to take hours, but I coaxed this little boy into taking a crayon and a coloring page from our supply.  He studied the foreign pictures and words as an elderly man studies the news; his mannerisms reflected agedness, pain, and a sense of giving up, as if he had already resigned himself to the pained existence that was his birthright. As we prepared to leave the village, I looked into the tired eyes that haunt me even today, I marveled at the fact that my world and his exist on the same planet, and I pledged myself to bear the responsibility of bringing help to this tired child who has come to represent my calling to medicine. As a child, I watched my grandfather practice medicine as a family physician, and I always found myself intrigued by his stories of helping people.  As a teenager, I celebrated with my aunt through her journey from medical school, to graduation, to successful completion of residency.  At each step of her journey I saw myself in the same arena and anxiously waited my turn to engage the challenges and enjoy the triumphs of a medical career.  As a wide-eyed college freshman, exploring all of the careers that medicine has to offer, my desire to become a doctor was cemented on a shadowing experience designed to excite me about the possibilities of a career in nursing.  While shadowing a maternity nurse, I had the opportunity to scrub into the operating room and witness my first surgery.  I was fascinated as I watched the doctors deftly turn a routine c-section into an emergency hysterectomy, and the experience confirmed my commitment to becoming a doctor.  However, it was as a young adult, saddened and amazed in the countryside of Nigeria that I realized that the call to become a doctor is less a responsibility to myself, and more a responsibility to each of the little boys with swollen feet and saddened faces that I hope to treat. Since the day that I became a part of the operating room, I have, in every respect, devoted myself to a career as a physician.  From the friendly anesthesiologist that called me to the table to explain each step in placing an epidural, to the intense surgeons that seemed unfazed by complications, I was mesmerized by my experience and pledged myself to learn everything that I could about this profession.  I scheduled a trip to North Carolina to learn more about my aunt's role as an emergency room doctor, and I read numerous biographies and autobiographies about doctors of every specialty.  At each step of my whole-hearted journey into medicine, I grew increasingly determined, more knowledgeable, and better prepared intellectually and emotionally for a career as a physician.         Sir Issac Newton said, If I was taller than others, it was because I was standing on the shoulders of giants.  I will master the challenges of a career in medicine because I stand on the shoulders of giants.  I stand on the shoulders of a grandfather in the twilight of his medical career who still rejoices in the gift of helping people.  I stand on the shoulders of a father who nearly lost his arm in an industrial accident and used the experience to instill in me a brand of perseverance and tenacity that I could not master by any other means.  Finally, I am standing on the shoulders of a young giant living outside the city of Jos, Nigeria who spoke eloquently about the plight of his people without uttering a word.  Admin Assistant, Guest Alumni Speaker As a distinguished alumni of Cincinnati Christian Schools in Fairfield, Ohio, I was asked to speak for a fund raising banquet.  I was identified by staff and administrators as an accomplished alumni based on my achievements as a student at Cincinnati Christian, as well as my academic and community service achievements following graduation.  As a guest alumni speaker I had the honor of speaking to current and potential benefactors at the school's annual fund raising dinner and kick-off for a five-year capital campaign., Community Outreach Volunteer As a member of the Vineyard Community Church, I have many opportunities to serve the underprivileged members of my community.  One of my favorite community service events is a weekly Saturday trip to Washington Park, a disadvantaged area of downtown Cincinnati.  During these trips we serve lunch to the adults and children of the local homeless population.  After exhausting our supply of food, we often spent several hours talking with the people that gathered and learning more about their lives and struggles.  This experience made me aware of the poverty that exists in my community and it increased my desire to serve my underprivileged neighbors.  I am now eager to serve this population in the medical profession and I believe that my willingness to understand each unique life and situation will enable me to serve this population better. In addition to service in downtown neighborhoods, I have also had the opportunity to work and serve at a community center called the Healing Center.  The Healing Center provides resources for underprivileged citizens, as well as those that have found themselves victim to the current economy.  As a childcare attendant, I enjoyed working in a place that provided not only basic needs, but also resources such as job training, career counseling, and skills classes., Peer Advocate As a peer advocate for the University of Cincinnati, I trained in crisis response, and provided the first line of support for student victims of abuse or relationship violence.  I was selected to be one of twelve students trained in the various aspects of crisis response including: cultural diversity and sensitivity, how to support and relate to a victim of violence, and training on the warning signs of a dangerous relationship.  I also had the opportunity to familiarize myself with many of the campus resources for victims of violence and relationship crimes, such as the campus judicial system, mental health services, and the campus police department. At the conclusion of forty hours of training, our team was assigned to a call schedule, and I began my rotations as primary and secondary on call.  In addition to call responsibilities, I participated in monthly in-service meetings for additional training and an opportunity to discuss our encounters with students. Beyond providing support to survivors, our group also worked to raise awareness of the prevalence of relationship violence, as well as provide information on the signs and symptoms of dangerous relationships.  At the conclusion of the academic year, our team was honored at the university awards dinner for outstanding service to the community., Technical Production Volunteer As a technical production volunteer, I am able to pursue my interests in production and filming by operating a camera for the weekend services at the Vineyard Community Church.  As a production volunteer I am committed to serving one weekend a month for a total of seven hours on my assigned weekend.  In addition to assigned weekends, I often volunteer for special events through out the year.  I have enjoyed using this experience as a creative outlet and a way to develop an extracurricular skill.  I am also glad to use this skill to serve my church community by providing video materials for internet-based broadcasts., Honors Research Organic Chemistry Lab As an organic chemistry student, I was selected for an Honors Research Experience on the basis of outstanding performance and academic achievement in organic chemistry coursework.  Under the direction of Dr Deborah Lieberman and Dr Allan Pinhas, our research group studied the mechanism of the synthesis of oxazolidinone from aziridine compounds.  I found this research to be especially interesting, as oxazolidinone compounds are being incorporated into antibiotics used to fight particularly resistant gram-positive bacteria such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. After our initial guided study of the mechanism, each research group was permitted to design and execute the experiments necessary to study the effect of different reaction conditions on the yield and purity of the product.  My research team chose to investigate the effect of different solvents on the product composition and yield.  After carrying out experiments, we were able to determine purity and the composition of any byproducts using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  I found my experience in research to be very satisfying, as I was encouraged to use critical thinking to solve problems, and given the opportunity to apply knowledge from the classroom in a practical setting., Care Management Assistant, Perinatal Programs, Trihealth Inc As the assistant to the Care Coordinator in the Perinatal Department, I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience working in health care and it has reaffirmed my desire to be a physician.  My position allows me to enjoy interactions with our doctors, as well as working side by side with the nursing staff to ensure that patients receive appropriate services.  This often includes working with insurance companies and home care agencies to arrange home care for patients that are preparing to be discharged.  I also work closely with our lactation consultants, and regularly assist with breastfeeding instruction for both inpatients and outpatients.  In addition to my role in patient care and interaction with our professional staff, I also coordinate our lactation retail department. Without a doubt, my favorite aspect of working in health care has been my contact with patients.  Working in an urban hospital has afforded me the opportunity to meet a wide variety of people from many backgrounds and a great array of cultures.  My greatest satisfaction comes from working with a patient to resolve an issue or enhance their maternity care.  I enjoy the opportunity to work with patients in my current role, and I know that my satisfaction will multiply when I am able to care for my patients as a physician., Paternity Enhancement Conference As the assistant to the Care Coordinator in the Perinatal Department, I often work to support our Birth Records Department.  As a Notary Public, I have received the training necessary to execute paternity affidavits for unmarried parents.  I was sent to the annual paternity enhancement conference in the spring of 2009 to represent the Trihealth health care system.  This conference in conducted by the Ohio Department of Paternity Enhancement, and conference activities include information on Ohio Laws regarding the establishment of paternity, as well as state practices regarding disputed paternity.,  Care Management Assistant, Die Cut Operator Hartco Incorporated is a vinyl coating and die cutting factory in Cincinnati, Ohio.  During my three-year employment at Hartco I received several awards and promotions.  My various responsibilities within the company included quality control inspector, machine operator, and ultimately night shift machine operator and shift supervisor.  While operating the die cutter, a machine used to convert bulk material into individual products, I was honored as employee of the month in October of 2006.   After two years of employment, I was promoted to machine operator and shift supervisor for the night shift.  As the shift supervisor, I was responsible for all aspects of production and quality assurance, and I was entrusted with the safety and security of the facility. My experience at Hartco will be beneficial to my future career as a doctor because of the character that I developed by being entrusted with a great deal of responsibility at a relatively young age.  While working in the factory I acquired a deep sense of respect for myself as I was stretched by mentally and physically demanding assignments.  As a shift supervisor I developed problem solving skills and leadership ability; I also discovered that I perform my best in high-pressure situations, and I genuinely enjoy the responsibility of leadership., Nanny I am the nanny for a family of eight children ranging in age from one to sixteen years old.  As a nanny I make a time commitment to the family and take on a great deal of responsibility.  In addition to taking care of the children at home, I am often responsible for shuttling children to and from school, sports practices, and special events.   Working for a large family teaches responsibility and time management skills.  I have mastered the ability to effectively manage the diverse needs of a wide age group while constantly prioritizing situations ranging from conflict resolution to minor medical emergencies., Dean's List Honoree I have been recognized on the University of Cincinnati Dean's List during each of my fifteen quarters at the University.  Twelve of these awards included highest honors for a 4.0 grade point average., College Physics Student of the Year I received this award for outstanding performance in physics lecture and laboratory from Dr. Fabio Santos in May of 2008., Service Trip to Jos, Nigeria In June of 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Jos, Nigeria to support the efforts of Back2Back Ministries.  Back2Back is based in Mason, Ohio, with a primary focus on creating sustainable enterprise and training local leaders in rural and under-served areas around the globe.  The Back2Back Mission in Jos is focused on creating and maintaining a clean water supply, as well as providing education and enterprise opportunities for those that have been affected by AIDS.    The stigma associated with AIDS makes it difficult for children affected by the virus to receive an education.  With this in mind, our team spent most of our time working at a boarding school that provides a home and education for children that have been affected by AIDS.  In addition to building projects that improved the functionality and safety of the space used to house the children, we were able to interact with the children and provide new supplies for the staff. We also had the opportunity to travel outside the city to bring supplies to one of the rural villages. In the village we were able to interact with the local tribal government, as well as witness firsthand the need for medical care among the rural villagers., Assistant to the Director of Family Ministry My position as the Assistant to the Director of Family Ministries at the Vineyard Community Church was a temporary internship position that gave me the opportunity to gain experience working with a diverse population.  My two primary responsibilities as an intern were to redesign and coordinate the program for children with special needs, and assist in the operation of the Children's Program portion of the Hispanic ministry.  Both of these projects were challenging for me, as I had no experience in either field, but ultimately they were especially rewarding because of the obstacles that I faced on my way to successful program implementation.   Through my experience working with children with special needs, I was able to learn about the different methodologies of care and teaching, and I was also able to learn more about the different diagnoses and conditions.  Ultimately, I was able to create a program outline that is still in use today as an effective outreach to children with special needs. In working with the Hispanic ministry, I learned a great deal about cultural diversity and how to incorporate cultural differences and cultural sensitivity into program planning, as well as individual interactions with people of different cultural backgrounds., Cappies of Greater Cincinnati The Cappies, Critics and Awards Program is a national student theater program focused on enhancing the student drama experience by providing publication and recognition opportunities for theater and journalism students.  Students from participating schools attend one another's theater productions and write reviews for each performance.  A team of theater and journalism teachers and experts then select the best reviews for publication in the Cincinnati Enquirer. As a charter member of the Greater Cincinnati chapter of the Cappies program, I was elected as the lead critic and student supervisor for my high school for each of my three years in the program.  As the student leader I served as a liaison between my school and program directors, as well as a resource person for the other students on my team.  As a student drama critic, I enjoyed multiple publications in the Cincinnati Enquirer, including a full-length feature review.  In addition to my publications, I was selected as Student Critic of the Year for the 2002-2003 school year.  At the culmination of my involvement in the Cappies organization, I was selected by my faculty mentor to receive an achievement award for overall contribution to the program as a drama critic, student lead critic, and drama student., Recipent of the Manna Scholarship The Manna Scholarship is a scholarship for children of employees at Hartco Incorporated in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Potential recipients are asked to provide academic records, records of community service, and information about future educational goals and ambitions.  After attending an interview with the scholarship foundation board of directors,  I was selected to receive a full college scholarship for all academic terms from the Winter Quarter of 2006 until the Spring Quarter of 2009.  In order to maintain my scholarship, I was required to attend annual meetings with the board of directors where I provided proof of continued academic achievement, as well as updates on community service activities and endeavors."

    "text": "As a child, I was exposed to the field of medicine on a regular basis. My grandfather, grandmother, parents, aunts and uncles were involved in one aspect of medicine or another. Often, I would listen to conversations between healthcare professionals that were seemingly in foreign languages, unconsciously absorbing what I could of the complex interactions. Even though I did not understand the meaning of those conversations, I felt the enthusiasm and dedication held by those professionals.  The desire for me to pursue a career in medicine developed gradually. There was no single life changing experience or event that compelled me to choose medicine as a career. Rather, relatively small experiences and bits of advice have paved a road leading me to where I am today, an aspiring medical student. Starting in high school, I developed a strong affinity for all sciences. I was always fascinated with reactions in chemistry, laws in physics, and the connections of systems in biology. Unlike many of my classmates, I never dreaded labs. Being able to apply what I have learned in a textbook to real life situations was a privilege to me. I found it intriguing to say the least. However, parallel to the development of my fascination with science, the desire to help others also developed in high school. The motto at my high school is Men for Others, which describes the type of men that are expected to graduate from that institution. While education was a high priority, helping others was also a high priority. I involved myself in several programs through the school that gave me opportunities to interact and assist diverse groups of people in need. I was a part of a program that assisted mentally handicapped persons with bowling, opening my eyes to a group I had been previously unfamiliar with. Also, I was a part of a housing rehab program that focused on cleaning up certain residences of people, primarily located in Over the Rhine, who could not afford renovations. Being apart of these programs were some of the first experiences I had with people suffering from disabilities and with people who are less fortunate than I. Interacting with these individuals not only helped me realize how fortunate I am, but also helped me realize the actions I ought to take to become a Man for Others.   While transitioning to college, I retained both my interest in science and my desire to help others. The summer going into my freshman year at Miami, I attended a week long mission trip to the south side of Chicago as well as volunteered for Dr. Michael J. Smith's Robotic Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Fellowship Laboratory. That summer was crucial for keeping my interests alive as I moved to a new era of my life at Miami University. The mission trip allowed me to establish relationships with people who did not have much in terms of material goods and shelter, as I lived with them and interacted with them on a daily basis. Volunteering for Dr. Smith's laboratory opened my eyes about what goes on behind the scenes of hospitals. I got to meet young and old doctors alike training to use the robotic surgery machine, the Da Vinci. I even had the opportunity to operate the robotic machine, revealing to me the vastness and endless possibilities of medicine.   In college, when faced with the need to make a career decision, I reflected back on my interest in science and the enthusiasm and dedication I had witnessed in my family members. Medicine seemed like the ideal combination of personal satisfaction and intellectual stimulation.   From the beginning, I knew that I wanted to not only treat individuals but also investigate and understand the underlying causes of disease. This lead me to the genetics and developmental biology research lab of Dr. Michael Robinson where I have been able to learn and practice the full spectrum of basic genetic and developmental biology research techniques. These techniques have allowed me to probe fundamental aspects of genetic mechanisms leading to ocular development in mice. These same mechanisms underlie human ocular development and we believe that our research should offer insight into various human conditions.  As I began to shadow various clinicians, I gained an appreciation for the profound emotional and physical impact a physician can make on the lives of his or her patients. This impact was made particularly clear while shadowing Dr. Theodosopoulos where he had to tell one patient he as terminal metastatic disease and cure another patient of his tumor. Observing the complexities of how a physician influences a patients life, I now understand why physicians feel such deep dedication and job satisfaction.  I have come to realize that being a physician is both demanding and exciting all at the same time. To me, being a physician is being a scientist, a teacher, and a caretaker. I know that medicine's confluence of basic science research combined with the opportunity to be a Man for Others will provide me with a profession that will satisfy me for the rest of my life. Good Samaritan Hospital Volunteer For one summer I volunteered at Good Samaritan Hospital at Dr. Michael Smith's Robotic Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Laboratory which trains doctors in the use of the Da Vinci robotic surgery machine. I helped prepare animals for in-vitro training of doctors of robotic surgical techniques. The most memorable experience of the fellowship is when they allowed me to operate the robotic surgery machine. I was allowed to try a variety of robotic surgical maneuvers. This experience gave me the opportunity to witness first-hand the development of a cutting-edge modality that, I believe, will one day be of benefit to patients everywhere., High School Basketball Coach I had the opportunity to be the head coach for a local recreational basketball team. The team was made up of local high school students who did not make the their high school basketball team and were still interested in playing basketball competitively. We held practice twice a week at a nearby recreational gym and competed in games at the regional elementary school on Saturday mornings. My approach to coaching these young basketball players was to ensure they had as much fun as possible while promoting discipline and dedication which is crucial for success in life., Neurology Shadowing I had the opportunity to shadow Dr. Theodosopoulos both in the clinic and in surgery. It was interesting to see diagnoses of serious medical conditions and the subsequent surgeries needed to treat them. The most profound experience I had was seeing Dr. Theodosopoulos diagnose a man with metastatic tumors to the brain. To see a physician present such devastating news to a man and his family in such a caring manner was like no other experience I have had before, giving me insight on the tough but necessary responsibilities of doctors., Nuerology Shadowing I observed Dr. Revilla in his clinic at the University of Cincinnati Neuroscience Institute. I saw Dr. Revilla analyzing many patients with Parkinson's Disease and patients with Parkinson's Disease symptoms. It was interesting to see how doctors scale the severity of a disease such as Parkinson's. I learned that doctors can monitor the progression of a disease through simple tests and then translate what he or she observed to a universal scale. I also learned how doctors can help out the families of the patients by providing them information on a disease and letting them know the best way to go about living with it., Orhtopedic Surgery Shadowing I observed two shoulder reconstructions and one hardware removal from the clavicle bone with Dr. Favorito. I also observed one ACL repair by Dr. Heidt. One of the more memorable parts of that day was the first shoulder reconstruction where an older man had a hard time moving his arm. Dr. Favorito cleaned the rotator cuff and found a slight tear in the bicep tendon. They decided to go ahead and fix the tendon to avoid a second procedure. This showed me that physicians are always thinking about what is best for the patient and may need to improvise in unexpected situations., Maher Award I received an additional grant toward my developmental biology and genetics research project. This award is an extension of the Undergraduate Research Award and is given by the respective departments of students who submit an outstanding proposal. The proposals were to be written as a typical scientific paper, including an abstract, introduction, methods, and discussion. Applying for the Undergraduate Research Award gave me experience in reading and writing scientific papers. Winning this award has boosted my confidence in reading and writing scientific papers which may be important in the future as a practicing physician., Undergraduate Research Award I received recognition and funding toward my developmental biology and genetics project. This award is given by the Office for the Advancement of Research and Scholarship at Miami University to students who propose a well planned and unique project that has the potential to make basic science discoveries. This award has given me extra resources for finishing my project on ocular development in mice which may contribute to knowledge of ocular development in humans.  I have also gained experience in reading scientific literature and writing grant proposals, which will be helpful in the future as a physician interested in research., Undergraduate Summer Scholars I received recognition, a stipend, six credit hours, and funding towards my developmental and genetics project. It is a scholarship that requires a nine week commitment to the proposed project during the summer terms at Miami University. The scholarship is given by the Office for the Advancement of Research and Scholarship at Miami University to students who design a project with a staff mentor. My mentor is Dr. Michael Robinson, who is the director of my lab. This opportunity has required me to develop the discipline necessary to plan and collaborate with other researchers., Radiology Shadowing I shadowed for a day at University of Cincinnati Radiology. I spent time with Dr. Gerald Ingalls, a fellow in radiology at the time. I watched him analyze MRI and CT scans along with X-ray images. It was beneficial to shadow him in particular since he was a young doctor who I could relate to. I also had the opportunity to observe interventional radiology with Dr. Jonathan Moulton, showing me the wide range and versatility of radiology. Overall, I was impressed with the interactions between physicians, young and old, to maximize accurate diagnosis and effective treatment., Philanthropy Chair My sophomore year I was elected philanthropy chair of my fraternity chapter. This entailed organizing events to raise money that was then given to our chapter charity. This charity is called Hole In the Wall, which is an organization to help children with serious illness have fun experiences that would otherwise be unavailable. Organizing these events entailed contacting sponsors, accessing materials, planning, recruiting and marketing, and cooperation with others. Being responsible for this position has been gratifying from a personal point of view as well as strengthened my organizational and leadership abilities., Member of Phi Delta Epsilon Medical Fraternity Phi Delta Epsilon is a common interest fraternity who's members are seeking a career in medicine. Events of the fraternity include fundraisers for organizations dedicated to specific medical conditions, speeches from current medical professionals, volunteer opportunities with local organizations, and chapter meetings. Coming to Miami University, I did not know many people who had the same career aspirations. Joining this fraternity helped me come in contact with a number of people who are on the same career path as me and helped me feel a part of a community with a common goal., Vice President of Rotaract Rotaract is an organization at Miami University that is the students' version of a local Rotary club. Over the past two years, we have been able to grow to around eighty members. The premise of this organization is to advance world understanding, goodwill, and peace through the support of health, education, and alleviation of poverty., Developmental Biology and Genetics Research The Robinson Laboratory primarily deals with the development of structures in the ocular region of mice. My project specifically deals with the role of an intracellular protein, Frs2a, which is necessary for normal development of the lacrimal gland. To determine the role of Frs2a, the binding sites of the specific protein are genetically mutated solely in the ocular region. To induce these mutations and deletions, transgenic mice are created and bred. Mice embryos and pups are harvested at different stages in development and are analyzed through multiple scientific assays., Undergraduate Research Forum The Undergraduate Research Forum at Miami University is a university wide event. Students from all fields of study present a poster at the forum, giving the students an opportunity to show and explain their work to other students who may not be familiar with that particular field. I found it very beneficial to present this poster because it gave me the opportunity to explain my research to people who are completely unfamiliar with developmental biology and genetics. I believe this will be helpful as a physician explaining complex information to the average patient., Midwest Developmental Biology Meeting This two day conference hosted by Cincinnati Children's Hospital consisted of speeches by scientists specializing in developmental biology as well as posters by students and other scientists. The lab I am affiliated with, the Robinson Laboratory, contributed two posters to the meeting, one of which I contributed to. Listening to the speakers and being a part of the meeting, I was able to connect seemingly unrelated research topics. For example, I could see the connection between research on lung development and my project on lacrimal gland development."

    "text": "As a young child at the age of five years, I arrived to the United States of America along with my parents and four siblings unsure of what the future had set for us. My parents decided to leave their home country and loved ones in hopes of a better future for their children. Lebanon, a country smaller than the size of New Jersey, was plagued with continuous political instability and dire economic conditions which made the possibility of any bright future unlikely. The ability to obtain quality education was limited, and my family could not afford the resources necessary to provide it.  As I grew up, I came to appreciate the importance of education and began to mark my own future. I strived to succeed in academics, for I had understood that such education was a privilege not to be taken frivolously. I graduated from high school as one of the top five honor students. Afterwards, I attended the American University of Beirut in Lebanon as an undecided major to discover the career options I had and spend time with my grandmother due to her deteriorating health condition. Throughout the first three semesters of college, I became a successful stock market day-trader and traded millions of dollars during my financial practice. Contrary to what I had believed, my success in trading did not provide me with any sense of self-fulfillment.   After my grandmother passed away, I also learned that my friend, who I had known since I was child, passed away following a motor vehicle accident. These significant events led me to re-evaluate my purpose in life. I knew for a fact that I did not want to spend my life caring only about myself while not giving a shred of importance to those around me. I knew that I was absolutely capable of making a difference in the future. As an individual who has experienced life in an third world country for several years, I realized that there were many underprivileged people with no access to medical care. However, the presence of a well-educated and driven physician, willing to make a difference, is absolutely capable of providing the help and care needed to improve the lives of people who needed such resources. Similar to the lack of educational resources I experienced as a child, many of them did not have the opportunities I was given in life. I recognized that the education I was acquiring should be utilized to help those around me, because a privilege is only a positive opportunity if used in a constructive manner.  My new and profound interest in medicine ecouraged me to transfer to the Pre-Medical Health Sciences program at the University of Cincinnati. I was well aware that this path would not be easy, but I was determined to succeed. I began volunteering at the Barrett Cancer Center at University Hospital and the Emergency Department at Cincinnati Children's Hospital to get involved directly in the healthcare setting. Such opportunities allowed me to constantly interact with patients and observe physicians on a weekly basis. I shadowed physicians in the internal medicine department and trauma care unit which allowed me to witness the level of respect, dedication, and consideration that physicians gave to their patients and other health care providers. I also saw the respect patients provided in return to the physicians who have dedicated their lives for their care and well-being. I observed the level of competence, professionalism, and intelligence physicians utilized while conducting their responsibilities. I knew that I had much more to learn about medicine, and each experience enlightened my path about what it mean to be a physician. I significantly improved my academic performance and became a Supplemental Instruction Leader for Anatomy and Physiology. I helped students learn more about the human body during weekly sessions and office hours. I also acquired effective communication methods which I learned during training and promoted teamwork, characteristics which I learned were important for a future physician. During my senior year, I continued to explore even more aspects of medicine. I became involved in research with the Department of Internal Medicine at University Hospital and worked with physicians and other health care professionals to develop patient-centered rounding models and analyze responses to various aspects of their treatment. I also intiated a research study in collaboration with the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences to analyze the effects of static and dynamic stretching on lower extremity range of motion and force production.  Looking forward, I know that a career in medicine will provide me with the greatest sense of self-fulfillment. This will allow me to strive to help others and become a leading member in society. I am well aware that the path I have chosen to take will definitely not be easy; however the journey to become a competent and qualified physician will be worthwhile. As I have learned, working to benefit one's self can be an easy endeavor, yet striving to become a leading member of society whose main objective is the benefit and support of others is a path requiring dedication, hard work, and perseverance. Research Study Primary Investigator After completing biomechanics and physiology, the program director of the Allied Health Sciences indicated the need of additional scientific research in the area of pre-exercise stretching. The purpose of my research study is to determine the effect of static and dynamic stretching on lower extremity range of motion and force production. As a primary investor (PI), I am responsible for recruiting participants for the study, obtaining consents, and conducting all major study activities. I also learned the process necessary to initiate a research study including IRB Protocol Submissions. This experience allows me to gain additional exposure the process of scientific investigation.,  Anatomy and Physiology SI, Development of Patient-Centered Rounding Models During the annual Health Sciences PRAISE Conference, I presented a poster which revealed the findings of my research in the Internal Medicine Department with authorization from my supervising physician, Dr. Savita Pai MD. I presented the concept of the patient-centered rounds which was developed throughout the year with collaboration from two rounding teams which including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and case managers at University Hospital. Additionally, responses from patient surveys were presented which showed the improvement in overall patient satisfaction scores, time spent with patients, in addition to other aspects of care provided by teams implementing patient-centered rounds.,  Emergency Department Volunteer, UC Dean's List (3.93 Cumulative GPA) and Honor Society For each quarter following my transfer to the College of Allied Health Sciences at University of Cincinnati, I was recognized by the Dean's List for outstanding academic performance. These quarters include: Spring Quarter 2009-10, Summer Quarter 2010-11, Fall Quarter 2010-11 (24 Credit Hours), Winter Quarter 2010-11, Spring Quarter 2010-11 (26 Credit Hours), Fall Quarter 2011-12, Winter Quarter 2011-12, and Spring Quarter 2011-12.  Additionally, I joined the Golden Key Honor Society after becoming one of the top 15% ranking students at UC following an invitation from Jennifer Lile, the Assistant Director of the University Honors Program. I also attend meetings throughout the year., Supplemental Instruction Leader for Anatomy and Physiology I became a Supplemental Instruction Leader for A&P 201-203 following the recommendation of Dr. Mary Fox, the professor of Anatomy and Physiology. As a student who successfully completed the course series, I was responsible for holding review sessions and office hours utilizing strategies I learned during training workshops. These sessions helped students discuss difficult concepts, prepare for upcoming exams, and develop study skills through presentations, class discussions, and also practice quizzes. As a supplemental instructor, I also helped students understand course requirements and maintained contact with Dr. Fox to ensure students covered all recommended course topics., Stock Market Trader I began university as a majorless student in the American University of Beirut for reasons I discussed in my personal statement. After successfully trading several million dollars throughout the first three semesters of college, I did not find any sense of self-fulfillment despite my success. After my grandmother passed away and my childhood friend died as a result of a motor vehicle collision, I realized that the field I had dedicated my time to only served me and absolutely no one around me. After reassessing my priorities in life, I found medicine and began to explore the field and transferred to the College of Allied Health Sciences at the University of Cincinnati., Distinguished Volunteer Merit Award I received the Distinguished and Loyal Volunteer Merit Award from University Hospital following my completion of more than 100 hours of volunteering time at the Barrett Cancer Center. I was also recognized for my uninterrupted volunteering including summer and holidays sessions., Emergency Department Volunteer I volunteer at the Emergency Department throughout the year including the summer. My primary responsibility is to check up on children and their families in the Emergency Room. I also facilitate communication between patients, families, or guardians and health care providers at each emergency room station. In addition, other tasks I complete during volunteering include: coordinate with emergency stations and nurses regarding any requests made by patients, sanitize children items for the safety and health of patients in emergency rooms, complete basic functions such as restocking supply carts, and provide children with the items which serve as distractions during inconvenient procedures., Barrett Cancer Center Volunteer I volunteer in the chemotherapy and radiation department during both the academic year and summer. I interact with patients on a weekly basis as I have the opportunity to assist them when they come in for treatment. My responsibilities included:  - Providing assistance to patients and their family members.  - Using the Barrett Center compassion cart during high volume days for activities during waiting times. - Escorting patients to chemotherapy and radiation appointments or the main hospital.  - Helping at the reception desk and notifying doctors, nurses, or assistants of patient's arrival.  - Classify and document registration papers.  - Assemble educational material., Physician Shadowing Shadowing physicians has definitely been a great experience as it provided me with valuable clinical exposure in various departments in addition to the opportunity of observing physician's interactions with patients and other health care staff. The physicians I shadowed include Dr. Savita Pai MD in the Internal Medicine Department, Dr. Peter Muskat in Trauma and Critical Care Unit at University of Cincinnati Hospital, Dr. Mourhaf Traboulsi at Firelands Community Hospital, and Dr. Salman Amad at Deaconess Hospital. I consider it a privilege to have shadowed these physicians during rounds as I observed the ethics, integrity, and dedication required during the practice of medicine., Research in Internal Medicine Department The objective of this research project was to analyze the difference in patient responses to care provided by patient-centered and traditional rounding teams. The patient responses asses aspects of physician-patient interaction, efficiency in communication, overall patient satisfaction, and patient's comprehension of the treatment process. The purpose of this project is to utilize the information to implement a transition from traditional rounds to patient-centered rounds at University Hospital through monthly orientations and weekly follow-ups. I also worked with the Associate Program Director, Dr. Savita Pai MD, to create the standard patient-centered rounding model., OSHA Lab Compliance Training, CITI, CPR/AED Certification The OSHA Lab and Compliance Training was necessary to comply with laboratory regulations for research studies I am involved in. Additionally, the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) was a basic certification which included the required modules of the Academic and Regional Health Centers Core Curriculum. I completed the certification in order to comply with regulations involving protection of human research subjects in social/behavioral research such as the study I have been conducting (Effect of Static and Dynamic Stretching on Lower Extremity Force Production and Range of Motion). Finally, I completed a BLS CPR/AED Certification as I am a volunteer at two hospitals."

    "text": "Mrs. Holden, why has Sam not been in school for three days I had asked. When Sam returned, she replied, Sam has been dealing with diabetic complications, but he is not contagious. My third grade self was happy. Sam looked healthy and my playmate had returned. Much later I learned about the permanency of diabetes, the daily regimen of pricks and shots that he would endure. Sams disease left me disappointed in medicines capabilities. Why wasnt there a cure The most frightening fact was that certain ethnicities had genetics predisposing them to diseases like Sams. The more I read, the more I reached for answers that could help prevent these diseases from reaching my own body. I thought to myself, what could I do for my own health I pursued an answer in the way I knew best, through learning. In college, I immersed myself in a research lab where I worked on an algae model for cilia. Research did not provide an immediate answer, but instead I faced a regimen of hard work and frustrations. I reveled in the challenge of learning, and I kept at it, try to answer my motivating question. At the time, I thought I was helping Sam. I thought I was helping myself.  Little did I know, research had taken my questions about health and actively reshaped them. A few months into the job, I began to notice a theme in all of my preparations. The beginning and ending criticism from my PI would always be to reiterate the goal of the study. The answer never changed; the study wanted to contribute to medicines understanding of human health. At that moment I realized why I was being pushed so hard. My PI wanted to direct my energies toward a bigger question, not only what I could learn today, but also what could I be doing for patients tomorrow. Realizing those goals required the highest quality work and the right perspective that someone would benefit from this work. I felt emboldened by the purpose of my work. Research gave me the opportunity to contribute to medicine, and I began to see medicine as a career that married both my scientific interests and my desire to help others. The knowledge I produced would ultimately benefit others, including myself. My lab work showed me that I could have a powerful hand in the process of medical discoveries, but a question remained. Why wasnt there a cure I knew that genetic diseases did not have a cure just yet, but I remained curious if part of the complication was rooted in administering treatment to the patients. To answer that question, I wanted to see firsthand how science translated from the doctor to the patient. I had the opportunity to visit a group of children who suffered from diseases that I studied. Most of them had problems breathing, and the cystic fibrosis patients were especially tricky for the doctors to handle. The first patient I visited was a teenage girl who loved horseback riding. Dr. Ferkol took his time asking her if she liked her new teachers, and if she had been in any new extra-curriculars recently. Then he asked her parents about her new cough and if there were any deviations from the back beating treatment. As I watched Dr. Ferkol work closely with this family, my ideas of medicine expanded far beyond my earlier impressions. I realized that medicine is much more than administering a therapy, but rather a holistic effort to consider Moms, Dads, and the childs habits when administering a cure. The relationships he built with each family strengthened his ability to work with them in bringing the daughters health back on track.    I came to understand that a cure was not always the complete remediation of a disease but instead, a goal that the doctor and the patient work towards. I saw medicine as the middle ground of understanding, a conciliation of the goals of the patient with what medical science could offer. I imagined myself in Dr. Ferkols place, working side by side with a patient to reach a solution. Many of these children were going to struggle with their disease throughout their lives, but I wanted to be part of the team extending the quality and length of that life.   \t I saw aspects of this care during my time helping others. When teaching, it is rare that a student and I meet and immediately begin batting for an A. Instead, the reward is the chance to work with that student step by step and see her mature into a better student. This parallel between coaching someone, and providing longitudinal care to patients cemented my sights on medicine. Research directed my love of science into a way of helping others, and I endorsed the caring partnership that I saw both in teaching and medicine.  I now find myself facing medicine, not because it had all the answers. Instead, I know it will provide me with the tools to answer my initial questions better, both for myself and for my future patients. A long career awaits me, but I am ready to face those challenges with the same unblinking curiosity that drew me to science and the care I wish to bring to many others. I ultimately look forward to coaching a community of patients through the same tough questions I faced when I heard about Sam, while creating well-informed and healthy lives. It is this empowering possibility that drives me to better medicine and provide care to patients.  City Year/Education, Organic Chemistry Teaching Assistant Each week, I met with the professor in a group setting to discuss what he wanted emphasized in the problem solving groups. Then every Thursday, I would run through a group recitation, where I detailed how to solve and think about that week’s problem set. At the end of each week, I held office hours to help other students catch up or to go more slowly through the material that may have been misunderstood earlier in the week. I would also prepare a lot of material outside of the classroom depending on student needs. That preparation came in handy especially during exam week, when students requested extra problems for practice. I was also responsible for grading and proctoring the exams., Physical Chemistry Teaching Assistant Every week, I would attend lecture and stay for questions afterwards. I would also have weekly office hours to help with homework or study with students preparing for the bi-weekly quiz. Teaching for this class was a different challenge when compared to my other TAships. The reason being is that the content of this material is usually more math intensive than students expect, so a lot of time outside class is spent on emphasizing principles of proofs and manipulating different theorems. Providing outside content or other textbooks for supplementation was less important than developing a student’s mathematical style so that they reached the same conclusion when tackling proofs., Physiological Control Systems Teaching Assistant For this class, I held three recitations weekly. A big component of the teaching was acclimating the students to the testing style, because of the detail contained in each question. For a third of the semester, I ran a weekly review session with a team of three TAs as we fielded questions and readied the students for the midterms. Learning to teach with other TAs provided a great forum for students to ask questions. The best part of this class is how TA-driven the class material can be. Each TA has the opportunity to write exam questions to emphasize different parts of the physiology taught and in recitation teach about their favorite organ systems so long as the core material is covered., Summer Surgery Student I learned about cardiac physiology, dissected a cadaver, and did lots of observation in the OR at the University of Cincinnati. The two weeks were modeled after an immersion experience where I would rise very early for classes on cardiothoracic physiology and then be identifying those organs that afternoon in the gross anatomy lab. We also tackled and presented case studies as diagnostic exercises. Additionally, we were able to shadow physicians in the OR to observe a range of surgical disciplines to help generate interests in particular fields of medicine. The cadaver work fascinated me. Opening its chest with a bone saw was one of my most intimate experiences with the human body., Undergraduate Researcher I learned how to do research on cilia in a genetics lab under the supervision of Dr. Susan Dutcher. I worked on a biochemistry project to purify proteins of interest. The goal of the study was to identify the possible structural or catalytic roles of a Pbc1 protein that gave unique phenotypes when the gene was knocked out of wild type C. reinhardtii.  The purpose of my work was to better understand cilia construction so as to understand the genetic basis of many ciliopathies such as polycystic kidney disease. My lab work involved learning how to do DNA and protein work in algae as well as bacteria (E. coli). Every two weeks, I was required to give lab meeting or to present at journal club., St. Louis Children's Hospital Shadowing I spent a week shadowing two doctors in the pulmonary ward. I saw patients that were affected by diseases that my lab studied. In the morning, I visited the patients in the ICU, and in the afternoon, I saw patients who visited the clinic. I was able to observe how a recovery ward runs, and the working relationships involved in the care of each child. I saw the teamwork between the nurses, pharmacists, and physicians as well as between hospitals when I sat in on a weekly conference call. I observed the problem solving involved in each case, and how the treatment team planned for a patient's treatment years down the line. The longitudinal care drew me closer to the idea of practicing medicine., Aristocats Member I sung for an on campus a cappella student group that sings Disney songs. We performed for many charitable events such as Autism Week.  Since joining, I helped recruit and grow this relatively new music group to be much bigger. Being involved in a new group was especially fun. This music group has taught me a lot about music theory, especially when we were in arranging season. My section leaders also tested my musicality and mentored me into a much better singer than when I first joined. I considered this group to be very close to me, since we spent a lot of time each week rehearsing. In my junior year, I was the concert chair and managed our biannual concerts, Be Our Guest and Bella Notte., HealthStreet Internship I volunteered as a community health worker to promote the health of St. Louis’ population. HealthStreet strives to bridge the gap between research institutions and populations that could benefit from the research occurring on the Washington University campus. Their goal was to help incorporate many ethnic populations into research studies. I helped make aware of these opportunities and connected the surrounding community to studies that provided information about their current illnesses. I worked with visitors on their resumes and referred them to health clinics if asked. I also visited local supermarkets and community centers to provide blood pressure tests and handouts about sexual health., Hospital Volunteer I worked in the schoolroom where I helped children catch up with their schoolwork. Every afternoon, my job was to make sure a good chunk of was done by the time I left. I also visited children in their rooms and offered to read books with them, hoping to keep their minds active.  I also worked in the playroom, where I visited children in their rooms and entertained them when their parents were not present. I also helped maintain a playroom that housed an arrangement of toys. The purpose of the playroom was to facilitate a fun environment so that the children are not stuck in their rooms all day. A large part of the job was fetching toys and movies for families that were staying overnight., Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) My summer lab project on algae was selected for funding. My results were presented at the annual Undergraduate Research Symposium at Washington University. I spent the summer purifying a protein out of E. coli, Pbc1 that gave odd phenotypes when knocked out of wild type C. reinhardtii. We wanted to test Pbc1 for its putative phospholipase activity to see if that was its enzymatic purpose during cilia regeneration. We hypothesized that it would be involved in the membrane signaling that brought other ciliary proteins to the base of the cilia.  The final step of the project was to characterize proteins in humans that were similar to Pbc1 to see if we can better understand cilia based diseases.,  Teaching Assistant, Asian American Association Treasurer/Freshman Representative The purpose of the Asian American Association (AAA) was to promote student interest in Asian cultural identity and politics. I helped AAA put on student socials during Asian holidays and a yearly formal. I helped planned for the yearly speaker forum and company meet-and-greets.  A big emphasis was put on connecting with fellow students and alumni through cultural activities.  I first joined as a freshman representative and focused on recruiting members into our general body. As a treasurer, I managed our finances and logistics for the programming planned for the year. I acted as a liaison between the student funding and AAA to allocate enough funds for welcoming big speakers to campus."

    "text": "My cousin, playing the role of my patient, lay on the operating table as I listened to his heartbeat on my Fischer-Price stethoscope. He's very sick, I said turning to my dad. It looks like we're going to have to operate. The seventeen year old memory has been captured on video and it is one my family loves to watch. I do not know where my inspiration to become a doctor came from but the seed that was planted during my childhood has now grown into my firm devotion to pursue a career in medicine.  Years after I had put away my toy medical kit, at the age of sixteen, I found myself once again in front of a patient on an operating table. Except in this instance, there was no role playing and the patient was my father. He had suffered a massive heart attack and as a result had gone into cardiac arrest moments after we had brought him into the emergency room. I remember the panic and the fear I felt over the possibility of a future without him. But due to the quick action of the ER team, I did not have to see my father die. The most compelling moment for me was when the doctor shook my hand, looked me in the eye and said, He will be okay. I trusted him and in the midst of all the chaos, felt at peace and reassured. Through this experience I was able to understand the pivotal role a physician plays not only in saving lives but also for providing reassurance to patients and their family members in times of distress. I became motivated to be like that doctor and, to one day be able to do for someone else what that doctor did for me.  Witnessing my father suffer and recover from the heart attack strengthened my resolve to further examine a career in medicine. During college, I shadowed physicians from a variety of specialties. One of the most profound and personal experiences, however, involved observing a cardiothoracic surgeon. This opportunity gave me insight into the challenges heart surgeons face and the rapid pace of new technologies being developed to tackle these difficulties and improving the lives of patients. Being exposed at such a personal level to the effects of heart disease has also contributed to my appreciation for the impact this field can have. I was able to see interesting patient encounters in other areas of medicine as well, but the most exhilarating to me was my time in cardiothoracic surgery. My desire to contribute to the battle against heart disease is one of my major driving forces towards a career in medicine.  Although shadowing allowed me to learn more of the day to day activities of physicians, I longed for the opportunity to interact with patients in a more direct manner. This is why I decided to volunteer at the Rehabilitation Center. Here, I spent time with individuals recovering from serious injuries. From this experience, I gained a better perspective into the importance of teamwork in medicine and that the health and well being of patients do not solely depend on the doctor. Collaboration is needed between doctors, therapists, nurses and volunteers to improve the quality of health care and provide reassurance to patients that they are in good hands. One meaningful event from my work at the center that has stayed with me is my conversation with Mrs. R. During her break between therapy sessions she asked me to take her outside so she could enjoy the nice weather. As I sat with her, she told me about her life, her grandchildren and her plans after she finished her rehabilitation. When it was time to go back in, she told me, Thank you for listening to me. It made my day better. I was amazed by how such a simple act can bring so much happiness for an individual during a time of stress and difficulty. Having the compassion and being there to listen is something I truly appreciate about physicians.  Shadowing and volunteering progressed my understanding of the clinical aspect of health care, but my research has allowed me to delve deeper into scientific inquiry, which is an equally important component. My time in Dr. Natividad Ruiz's lab was a great opportunity to learn some of the important lab techniques used today as well as a chance to apply the theory I learned in my courses to a practical situation. I also gained an understanding of the frustrations that research brings forth and an appreciation for the creativity that accompanies coming up with and testing a novel question. Far from the cookie cutter perception I previously held, research is as much of an artistic process as it is a scientific one.   As I reflect upon that seventeen year old memory, I realize that the seeds of a career in medicine may have been planted early in life, but it is the experiences of the past several years that have strengthened my resolve to pursue this arduous but exhilarating career path. As I move forward, I still feel the same excitement for medicine that I did as a child. However, through firsthand experience, only now do I truly appreciate the profound and far-reaching impact this field can have on the lives of others. A career in medicine will best allow me to combine my passion for science along with my continued commitment to ease the suffering of others. Honors and Scholarships 1.

    "text": "The sounds of a videotape being inserted into the VCR and the upstairs door closing shut were frequent experiences of mine during childhood. The movie to entertain me and a retreat into the dark, quite bedroom were my mother's only repose from debilitating migraines.  On her worst days, she would spend a large portion of her time in extreme pain and unable to eat or drink because of severe nausea. After many failed treatments, my mother eventually found significant relief from her migraines and was able to consistently function. This personal experience made me recognize the large impact that a medical disorder can have on the life of a patient and their loved ones. Patient's life stories such as my mother's and the active role that physicians are able to play in them fascinate me and motivate me to pursue a career as a physician.  \t \tDuring my years in college, I had more contact with the field of medicine and was able to observe the patient stories from an office setting. While observing a physician in a headache clinic, I had one of my most profound medical experiences. A male patient with a history of chronic cluster headaches came into the office and vividly discussed how everyday he would suffer from such excruciating pain behind his eye that he would repeatedly beat his head against the wall. He told the physician that the pain was so severe that he even considered suicide during those dark moments. Further, he spoke about the stress that the disorder put on his marital life and the possibility of losing his job due to his high number of absences. The physician assured the patient that there were effective therapies to combat his headaches, but to achieve optimal results there were things that the physician needed to do and others that the patient had to do.  I came to recognize the importance of a strong therapeutic alliance between the patient and physician as well as the enormous trust placed in the physician by the patient. Fortunately, preventive therapy greatly helped the man and his frequency of cluster headaches significantly decreased. This specific example allowed me to see the physician's role in the most desperate of circumstances and the intrinsically fulfilling nature of successful medical treatment. After observing the patient stories from the doctor's perspective, I knew that medicine is much more of a vocation than a job and that I would find the role that physicians play in society highly rewarding in its own right.  \t \tMoreover, I have noticed that many doctors actively participate in the stories of their patients through medical research. They are able to combine observations made through listening to patient's stories and make discoveries that could lead to more effective treatments. My father, who is a physician in the Division of General Internal Medicine at the University of Cincinnati, is an inspiration to me in this respect. His research on the relationship between ovarian hormones and migraine headaches has investigated an area of the disorder in which relatively little is known. The findings from his study are exciting because they may provide one piece to the puzzle of a new treatment for migraine headaches in women like my mother.  \t \tThis research made me eager to get involved in a field of study that could allow me to conduct research and attempt to advance scientific knowledge to benefit people. I am drawn to the field of psychology and neuroscience, my major and minor respectively, because of the strong emphasis on research methods and statistics used in the pursuit of a better understanding of the human mind. My work in Dr. Smart's cognitive psychology laboratory has taught me how to interact with human participants and design experiments to best answer practical research questions. The guidance I received in this lab has given me the tools and desire to devise my own experiment on which I am currently working to investigate automobile breaking behavior in a virtual environment.  \t \tWhile I thoroughly enjoy my research in psychology, I am adamant about transferring the skills I learned in this field to medical research where I can become a part of the patient stories that deeply intrigue me. It was this reason that I volunteered last summer to work on a study investigating a possible correlation between joint hypermobility syndrome and migraines and am continuing my involvement this summer. I am currently working on a follow-up study by conducting patient interviews and performing joint hypermobility examinations, which has only reaffirmed my passion for the medical sciences and awareness of the direct connection that medical research can have on human lives.  \t \tThus, my personal and collegiate experiences have allowed me to identify the primary focus of medicine: the person. The roles and responsibilities of physician are always tied to people and subsequently the stories of the patients' lives. My enthusiasm and hard work arise from this aspect of the job, and I feel that my personality and rigorous training make me an excellent candidate to become a physician. Joint Hypermobility Syndrome and Migraine Headache Paper Bendik EM, Tinkle BT, Al-shuik E, Levin L, Martin A, Thaler R, Atzinger CL, Rueger J, Martin VT. Cephalalgia. 2011 Apr;31(5):603-13. Epub 2011 Jan 28.  I was involved in writing the manuscript, participating in discussions of the statistical analysis of the data, and helping with data entry. Furthermore, I am working on a follow up study in which I conduct patient interviews and a joint hypermobility examination. This experience has given me the opportunity to participate in clinical research in the field of medicine and interact one-on-one with patients., Physician Observation I observed seven different physicians at University Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio for a total of 54 total hours. The physicians I shadowed worked in the Division of General Internal Medicine, the Department of Emergency Medicine, Department of Neurology and the Department of General Surgery. These experiences allowed me to see the work of a physician on a day to day basis and compare and contrast the way medicine is practiced within and between specialties. It fascinated me to witness patient-physician interactions and to observe how patient care was a team effort made by physicians, nurses, residents, and medical students. I am very eager to do more physician observation., Undergraduate Research Grant I was awarded $217 for my experiment proposal to investigate automobile breaking behavior in a virtual environment. I observed that car tail lights only reflect if a car brake is depressed and convey no information about the rate of deceleration. I hypothesize that a tail light system in which the light intensity matches the rate of deceleration will allow trailing cars to brake more effectively. I have already modeled the 3d environment for the experiment and am currently working on implementing it into virtual reality software. Making an observation and designing an experiment is common in medical research, and I think this experience has given me insight into this process., Research Assistant for the Univ of Cincinnati’s Psych Depart I was involved in two research projects, one with Dr. Robert Frank and one with Dr. Michael Riley. My work with Dr. Frank involved designing an experiment to investigate the effect of broad and specific labels on odor perception and memory. He gave me the task of modifying the protocol from his previous experiment and devising broad and specific labels to classify the synthetic chemicals used to produce odor in the lab. My work with Dr. Riley, on the other hand, consisted of helping to design an experiment to assess whether olfactory stimulation influences postural control. I also helped to address problems that arose during the pilot study and ran participants., Research Assistant in Dr. Jay Smart’s Cognitive Psych Lab In the lab, we study postural control and coordination in human subjects, often using a motion capture device and virtual reality. More specifically, we test to see how people adapt their movement to function in the presence of normal and novel stimuli. Motion sickness and the coupling of vision with postural control are two areas in which we have recently tested. My role in the lab is to guide the participants through experiments, input data into the computer, and analyze data with computer software. Through my involvement in the lab, I have learned about postural control, strengthened my fascination with human research, and improved my understanding of appropriate research methods., Volunteer at Matthew 25 Ministries Matthew 25 Ministries (M25M) is a disaster aid and humanitarian relief organization for the poor. As a volunteer at M25M, I sorted and packaged donations (mostly clothes) to prepare them for distribution to those in need. Many of the contributions were corporate donations of apparel they no longer needed. The experience showed me that what some people discard as useless can be extremely valuable to others. In addition, M25M helped me to understand that an inability to afford clothing is not solely an issue for developing nations but also exists here in the United States. I believe these lessons are valuable to me because physicians must learn to be resourceful and empathetic., Member and Alumni Chair of Phi Sigma Pi Phi Sigma Pi is a National Honor Fraternity dedicated to scholarship, leadership, fellowship, and service. The Miami University (MU) chapter contained 74 members from many majors. In addition to attending weekly meetings and participating in events that embodied these values, I served as the alumni chair my junior and senior year. Responsibilities of this position include corresponding with former members, organizing events to increase interactions with alumni, and attending weekly executive board meetings. Furthermore, I represented the MU chapter at the national meeting in Harrisburg, PA from August 5-8, 2010 where decisions about national agenda and amendments were made., Saint Louis University Global Medical Brigades Club and Trip The Global Medical Brigades (GMB) is national organization with college chapters that fundraise and organize medical relief trips to provide developing nations with sustainable healthcare solutions. While on campus, I primarily participated by volunteering at our fundraising and recruiting events and attending meetings to discuss the logistics of the trip. Moreover, I travelled with the Saint Louis University GMBs and doctors we had recruited to Tegucigalpa, Honduras and stayed for one week to help provide medical relief to the rural population. I worked in the pharmacy, laboratory, translation, and triage stations as well as observed the physicians conduct interviews with the local people., David and Helen Bernie Scholarship This competitive scholarship awards $1600 for one academic year to a College of Arts and Sciences major based on academic merit. First preference is given to students pursuing pre-medical studies., Research Assistant in Dr. Lynn Olzak’s Visual Psychophysics Time in the lab consisted of running psychological tests to investigate the underlying neurological processes behind spatial vision. The tests require the research assistants to attempt to discriminate between stimuli of varying spatial frequencies presented on a computer screen. From my work in the lab, I gained an appreciation for how psychological tests can help scientists to make deductions about the function and structure of biological systems."

    "text": "Sir Elton John sings a song entitled Heart in the Right Place. I do not completely understand the purpose of the song, but the concept is one which I find incredibly important. Happiness and success are two vital aspects of life, neither of which can be achieved unless one's heart is in the right place. People do what they need to in order to make money and get by in life, but I feel that you cannot truly be happy or feel successful unless you are doing the right things for the right reasons. I knew I wanted to be a doctor one September afternoon in 2006. I was lifeguarding the pool when someone rushed in screaming, demanding my help. I grabbed my First Aid kit and came across a young boy crying. He had slit his foot open on hedge trimmers that had been carelessly left in the grass by the playground. I began doing what I was trained to do. The boy then stopped crying, looked up at me, smiled, and muttered a thank you. How I felt is hard to describe. I was just doing my job, but knowing that I was able to take someone's pain and suffering away just by caring for them is one of the most satisfying feelings. I immediately knew that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  \tA second memorable experience that led me down this road has been observing autopsies. I shadowed Dr. Burkhardt of the Butler County Coroner's Office last year as he worked toward discovering the cause of death of three different victims. This was amazing, since all of my previous knowledge of anatomy had come from dissecting dead frogs and pigs that had been preserved. With the autopsies, not only was I learning human anatomy, I was seeing things the way they are in living people. I discovered that the texture of organs from preserved animals is much different than that of humans who had been alive only a few short hours ago. Holding human hearts, brains, and livers in my own hands and learning about them in that fashion is a lot more interesting, educational, and practical than reading about them in books. This also added the psychological aspect of dealing with death, which most physicians have to experience sooner or later. \tIn addition to medical experience, I am currently gaining my first research experience this summer. Since I am so busy during the academic year with classes and extracurriculars, summer is the only time I have to do research. When I took a physiology course last semester, the respiratory system fascinated me more than any other part of the human body. I applied for this internship because it focuses on pediatric pulmonology. I am incredibly excited to be doing research on material that I find so interesting. I firmly believe that you can only achieve your true potential when your heart is in the right place. \t  \tAnother reason I applied for the pulmonology internship and what is now the most personal reason I have for wanting to go to medical school is because of my little brother, who is currently experiencing severe lung problems of his own. It started with what appeared to be just a sinus infection, but then it grew much worse. He went to our family doctors several different times, and each time they just gave him another antibiotic to try. This in itself is completely ridiculous, since the current rate at which doctors are over-prescribing antibiotics is actually causing more infections than it is preventing. After about a year, the doctors finally decided it was time for my brother to see some specialists. He has now been to at least six different types of doctors, gets more x-rays and blood drawn than I feel is healthy, and has even had samples of bone marrow taken, which is the most pain I have ever witnessed another human being endure. He is such a good sport and never complains about any of this, but his health problems are tearing my parents to shreds. They have been taking him to countless appointments, spending insane amounts of money on machines and procedures that are supposed to help him, but we still do not have any answers. I cannot help but think that my little brother would be completely healthy if the doctors would have realized something was not right just a bit sooner. His situation motivates me to become the best physician I can be, in an attempt to prevent situations like this from occurring to other families. If I do come across a case like this in my career, however, at least I will be able to relate to those who are being affected. \t \tIn conclusion, I know now more than ever that I am a great fit for medical school. I have the necessary grades and academic drive, but I believe I have something a little more important as well. I have so much out there motivating me, a burning passion that will help get me through these next few years, and I will not stop until I reach my final goal of becoming an outstanding physician. I understand that this process will require lots of hard work, I realize that the hours will be strenuous and many, and I know that several sacrifices will need to be made, especially those regarding my personal life and when or if I will be able to start a family of my own, and I am perfectly accepting of this. I have a goal in mind, and I have no intention of giving up. Anything is possible and bearable as long as your heart is in the right place ACROPOLIS Mentor - Leadership Training ACROPOLIS is a weekend-long retreat for emerging leaders from all Fraternities and Sororities on Miami's campus. Each group sends 1-2 representatives, they spend the entire weekend learning different aspects of leadership, and they end up meeting everyone who will be the future leaders of the Greek Community. I attended this retreat as a representative for Lambda Chi Alpha in 2009, and I liked the experience so much that I trained to become one of the mentors for the following year, so that I could make the experience for next year's participants just as amazing as it was for me. I had weekly meetings with the other mentors, where we figured out how to best approach each facet of leadership., Greek Life Guide As a GLG I am assigned a dorm or hall of freshmen males, and I am in charge of letting them know everything about Greek Life. Since Greek Life is prevalent on Miami's campus, it is important to inform freshmen of the reasons people should join a fraternity. Many people think it is just about the partying, so this is where I come in. I have weekly meetings with the men in the basement of their dorms and answer any questions. I am not allowed to tell them which fraternity I am in, so it is more about promoting Greek Life as a whole than recruiting for my own chapter. I firmly believe that there is the perfect fraternity out there for every man, and I love that I get to help them find it., Lifeguarding/Water Safety Instructor/Adaptive Aquatics As a Lifeguard I ensure that patrons follow rules in, on, and around the water for their own safety. I also take hourly readings of pool chemicals, save drowning victims, and provide care and First Aid whenever necessary. As a WSI I teach private and group swim lessons to people from ages 18 months - 60 years old, conduct at least one safety lesson every session, evaluate students on their improvement, and inform parents on the success of their children. As an Adaptive Aquatics Instructor I teach swim lessons to children who are mentally and/or physically disabled in a manner that better suits their needs., Waterski and Wakeboard Team For the past 12 years, my family has gone on a summer vacation near a lake. For 8 of those 12 years, I tried learning how to waterski every single time, and I failed every single time. When I came to Miami, I heard about the Waterski Team. They competed against other schools, but they also taught people how to ski. I decided to give skiing one more shot, and figured if these people couldn't teach me, no one could. I didn't get up on my first try, but the team captain gave me one small piece of advice that I had been missing for 8 years. I tried again, and was up on the water and skiing within seconds. This taught me to never stop trying something you have your heart set on accomplishing!, Lambda Chi Alpha - Fraternity I am one of the re-founding fathers: we rechartered LCA at Miami my freshman year. As the Recruitment Chair, I learned how to be personable, how to meet new people and engage in conversation without previously knowing them, and how to cater the Greek experience to their needs. As the Fraternity Educator, I learned how to teach people information that they needed to know, but in a hands-on manner that was relevant, interesting, and easy to remember. As the Vice President, I learned how to manage a large group of people and a large budget, how to foster brotherhood within the chapter, and how to resolve disagreements. Overall I learned when to be a leader, and when to let others take charge., Guiding Eyes - Dog Trainer I have raised and trained a few dogs of my own, so now with the help of my family, we are raising a puppy that will, instead of being our own, hopefully go on to help a blind person gain more independence. I have been in charge of teaching the puppy how to perform tasks that will be necessary for him to carry out for a blind person. I also have to expose the puppy to public places like churches, parking lots, and buses/public transportation systems. It is difficult, since he is a puppy and just wants to run around and play, but it will definitely be worth it in the end when we get to attend a reception to watch him lead a blind person across a stage for the first time., North American Food Drive Volunteer I never realized how many people struggle to obtain food until I came to Oxford and started volunteering at the food pantry through Lambda Chi Alpha and the North American Food Drive. I remember shopping for cereal at Walmart late one night and seeing a young girl grab a box of Fruit Loops. As she was about to throw it into the cart that her mother was pushing, her mother told her that they couldn't get that cereal or any other name brands, since their food stamps didn't cover them. The girl put the box back and started crying. I told this story to my fraternity, and through tons of hard work, we were able to donate over 240,000 lbs of food to needy families in Oxford in the past 2 years., Physician Shadowing I spent a week with Dr. Yu and her family a few summers ago. I got to shadow her as well as 4 orthopedic surgeons. This experience was very eye-opening for me. These doctors specialized in pain management, which was particularly interesting to me, since I have chronic pain of my own. I had tried for years to make the pain go away until I finally found something that worked. I know exactly what these people are going through, and I would find it extremely rewarding if I could lesson their pain, since I know what a relief it is. It was really neat seeing patients enter the hospital in pain, and leave a little bit later: still not perfect, but smiling, and in a much better mood than before., Music Performance I started learning piano in 3rd grade and viola in 4th grade. Since then I have been a part of many different orchestras, including my high school's Concert Orchestra, String Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, Symphonic Orchestra, and Pit Orchestra, as well as 2 different Honors Orchestras in the Cleveland area. I also play with other ensembles when they need extra musicians, like when the choir needs string players for the Hallelujah Chorus. Another time the Pit Orchestra needed another violinist for Guys and Dolls, so I learned how to play violin for that. I have also started learning how to play the cello within the past 2 years. I continue to learn and improve my playing abilities., Pediatric Pulmonology Summer Internship/Research Program I was accepted to participate in a summer research internship at Case Western Reserve University in combination with the the Pediatric Pulmonology division of Rainbow Babies and Children's Hopsital (University Hospital of Cleveland). 164 students applied for only 20 positions, so this is a pretty prestigious program. My mentor Dr. Elliott Dasenbrook is an MD, but he also does a lot of clinical research, and he has devoted his work toward discovering better ways to treat and lengthen the life span of patients with Cystic Fibrosis. I have the best of both worlds, since I am shadowing a physician for 10 weeks, but I am simultaneously learning about the entire research process., Hospital Volunteer - Emergency Room I work from 10PM-1AM, help the ER staff with patients, and I get to shadow a different ER Physician each night. One of the doctors even taught me how to use staples and sutures, even though I only practiced on an orange peel. I have learned that being a doctor demands a rigorous schedule that can change in an instant, and it can severely cut into time otherwise spent with family or sleeping. The most valuable lesson I learned from this experience though is that physicians, especially those working nights in the ER, must be able to evaluate novel situations on the spot, act quickly, and draw from everything they have learned thus far in order to make what will hopefully be the right decision.,  Lifeguarding/Swim Lesson Instructor, Undergraduate Assistant for ZOO/BMZ 115 Lab Miami biology students have to choose between Botany, Microbiology, or Zoology, hence BMZ. These students typically take BMZ 115 during freshman year, which is a combination of all three branches of biology. This course also has a lab section that meets once a week. I took the honors section of BMZ 115 my freshman year, and since I did well, I was asked to help teach the lab section the following year. I helped the TA explain to the students the science behind all of the experiments, and when she was presenting it in a way that was confusing, I was usually able to offer a student's perspective and clear things up. I also met with students outside of lab to help them with their lab reports., Miami MED Miami MED is an honorary society of premedical students designed to expose us to all facets of medicine. Not only did this group help us prepare for the MCAT and medical school applications, but we gained insight into all aspects of life as health care professionals. Each meeting we would talk to a different guest speaker. I learned what to expect from residency from a woman who just graduated from medical school, how to start your own private practice if you have  the right combination of money, people, and time, and a married couple of physicians told us how they were able to balance both their careers and still see their 4 children grow up. These are things they can't teach you in class., President's List/Dean's List The above average hours/week is the estimated time I spent studying each week, which ultimately led to me receiving the aforementioned awards.  I made the President's List, which recognizes students who receive a 4.0 grade point average for the semester. This occurred during Fall Semester of Freshman Year, Fall Semester of Sophomore Year, and Spring Semester of Junior Year.   I also made the Dean's List, which recognizes students who receive a grade point average between 3.5 and 3.9. This occurred during Spring Semester Freshman Year, Spring Semester Sophomore Year, and Fall Semester Junior Year., Animal Shelter Volunteer The Animal Adoption Foundation in Hamilton is a no-kill animal shelter, unlike many others, so they are almost always full and don't have much room for extra animals until one gets adopted. As a volunteer, I cannot do too much, other than giving the animals attention. This is a huge deal though, since many of these animals come from abusive owners, so all they want is an owner who gives them the love and attention that they deserve. Volunteers are in charge of taking the dogs out every now and then, giving them food, keeping their cages clean, keeping the entire facility clean so that it looks good when potential adopters arrive. This experience taught me that small gestures go a long way."

    "text": "The teacher's question was simple enough, but even as an elementary schooler, I knew that its answer would have far-reaching implications. What do you want to be when you grow up My mind raced as I sat at my desk. I thought I wanted to be a doctor. My neighbor was a doctor. I'd be helping people. Why not  I waited as each student answered in turn. Soon it was time for my desk neighbor's response. I want to be a neonatologist, she announced in a tone of smug superiority. My jaw dropped. The teacher was suitably impressed and stopped class for several minutes so that we could listen to a detailed job description. I knew that my more tentative doctor answer was now totally outclassed.  An interest in the field of medicine stayed with me through the rest of my education, though. I enjoyed my science courses, and a field that directly helped others was inherently more appealing than the alternative. But even in college, my elementary school hesitation to declare myself a pre-med student remained. What basis did I have to state that so firmly My interest in medicine grew as I observed the profession as an ER volunteer, but I still felt that I would be happy so long as I had a career and was self-sufficient. Like my classmate from years ago, so many of my peers spoke of a firm conviction; they knew that it was the only option for them. I worried that my diverse interests and recognition of several possible paths for my adult life meant that I wasn't committed enough to become a physician.  I also understood that medical school meant that the rest of my twenties would be a period of prolonged emotional and financial strain. With my continued worry that I had somehow missed a major revelation that my pre-med classmates had all shared, I decided to jump into the job interview process during my final year of college. Against economic odds, I found employment with The Nielsen Company, consulting for the Procter & Gamble hair care team. It was reassuring to have a path set.  After graduation, I moved to Cincinnati to begin my career.  I have spent the last two years developing my understanding of sales forecasting and how to analyze consumer feedback. Some days it's very rewarding, with the excitement of leading global projects and the gratification of positive client feedback as we work to build a better consultative relationship. But I don't find a strong sense of meaning in my work- on a personal level, do I care how many bottles of Pantene they sell  To be clear, a lack of deep fulfillment from my current job is no reason to become a physician. Recruiters could provide many other exit options; however, my time in the work force has taught me several lessons that have finally given me the conviction to firmly pursue becoming a doctor. First, I've learned just how much time and thought a full-time job takes. It becomes a part of your identity. I don't want to devote that much of myself to something that I don't find meaningful, and it will require more than just a company change to find what I'm looking for. I don't want to 'live to work,' but I don't want to 'work to live' either- I want my work to be something that enriches my non-work life, allows continual development, and builds me into a stronger person. Few fields offer this to the degree that medicine does.  I've also learned that I like analytical work but require a rigorous and scientific approach. My current job drew me with its focus on logic and reasoning. However, the analytical work, such as sales forecasting and cutting data to look at different consumer groups, is significantly complicated by consumer overstatement and inaccurate self-reporting of opinion or future activity. Assessing consumer opinion sometimes seems like an equal amount of guesswork as actual analysis. Physicians contend with patients who may present a distorted picture of their symptoms in the same manner that consumers misrepresent their opinion, but medical analysis strikes me as much more real and rewarding, a truer use of analytical techniques, since it is supported by the concrete, rigorous techniques of modern medicine.  Lastly, my current job has taught me about my own working style. Previously, I knew that I would be engaged by medicine's analytical side. I was less certain about my enthusiasm for interacting daily with patients. Structured, professional communication seemed like it could be draining. To my surprise, though, my favorite part of my job is the social side. Collaborating with my team and building partnerships with clients are what I look forward to most. As I now envision myself working as a physician, patient interaction is a huge draw, not only an essential part of the job but also one of the most enjoyable aspects.  With subtle, gradual steps rather than the definitive epiphany that I awaited throughout my education, my time in the workforce has cemented my commitment to becoming a doctor. I better understand my work style and how it would correspond to the career of a physician. My non-medical career has provided a sense of clarity and determination to become a doctor that will be critical during the challenges that are sure to accompany such a demanding career and the training that it requires. Post-Collegiate Employment at BASES As detailed in my personal statement, after college I began work at BASES, a division of the The Nielsen Company.  My group consults for Procter & Gamble Hair Care.  P&G provides concept boards describing products that may launch, and we gather consumer feedback on the initiatives.  My day-to-day work is split between sales forecasting and analyzing and presenting study results.  Given my company's close proximity to P&G, I also spend time at the client for both regularly scheduled office hours and project-specific meetings., Residential Programs and Services Community Leaders Program As part of the Community Leaders program at IU, I led dormitory tours for prospective students.  With up to three other guides, I helped to manage groups of up to 100., Recognition Summary Below is a list of my most significant undergraduate awards and scholarships. -Phi Beta Kappa: inducted December 2007 -John W. Ashton Award, Tracy C. Owens M.D. and Anna L. Sproull Owens Memorial Scholarship; Nancy Weber, D.O. Scholarship: IU College of Arts and Sciences Senior Scholarships -Marie S. Wilcox Scholarship: IU mathematics scholarship -Quentin M. Hope Memorial Award: IU French scholarship -Edward L. Hutton International Experiences Program Grant -IU Bloomington Founders Scholar -USC Trustee Scholar: full tuition at USC -Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship -Mary K. Garr Scholarship: hometown scholarship -National Merit Scholarship, Departmental Undergraduate Instructor/Peer Mentor Programs From September to December of 2006, I worked as a Peer Tutor for the Introduction to Computer Science course, which covered the Scheme programming language. This was organized by the Computer Science Department (now a part of the School of Informatics and Computing) and involved tutoring at weekly office hours for students needing homework help.  I also worked as an Undergraduate Instructor for the Mathematics Department's Finite Mathematics course for three semesters, including September to December of 2007 and September 2008 to May 2009. This required working at weekly group tutoring sessions, answering e-mails for the class homework help e-mail address, and grading quizzes and tests., IU Club Volleyball I have had a long and eventful relationship with the sport of volleyball.  After several years of playing, I took a break during my last two years of high school to run cross country, so club volleyball at USC was a much-anticipated return to the sport.  Continued participation helped smooth my transfer to IU.  After my time on the IU varsity team, I rejoined the club team with a new perspective.  I saw that I could play more dominantly and tried to drive intensity among my teammates.  It was rewarding to regain a sense of confidence in my abilities, and the dramatic shift from varsity to club was a unique opportunity to reassess my role on the team and rebrand myself as more of a leader., Study Abroad- Aix-en-Provence I lived in Aix-en-Provence with an IU-sponsored study abroad program.  After a required introductory course at a school for foreign students, I took a full native courseload at a French university, including courses in linguistics, history, anthropology, and philosophy of science.  The IU program ran day trips to visit nearby cities, and I was also able to travel to several other countries.  I played volleyball in France with the university recreational teams, which segued into an opportunity with the more selective regional team.  We won a national championship despite rarely practicing, which was quite a contrast with my experience on IU's team with intense practices and a losing season., Indiana University Varsity Volleyball I spent one year as a walk-on with the IU volleyball team.  This was a major time commitment, involving practices (~3 hours per weekday in-season), weight lifting and conditioning outside of practice hours, and additional team meetings.  During the season, weekends were dedicated to matches, and the travel schedule required coordination with professors to avoid any disruption to my classroom performance.  The spring off-season also involved practices and additional emphasis on lifting and conditioning.  It was a privilege to be on a team with such a great group and to train at such an elite level, but it required a lot of sacrifice and energy and was a major test of time management skills., Bloomington Hospital ER Volunteering I volunteered in the ER at Bloomington Hospital for two semesters. While some of the volunteer time was spent on mundane tasks like helping to clean rooms or fetching drinks, there were also moments of significance to make it worthwhile. It was my first exposure to the ER environment, so it was eye-opening to see firsthand the misuse of emergency facilities for primary care (and how many visits were due to alcohol consumption). My most memorable volunteer experience was when I observed a stent placement for a man having a heart attack. The patient's panic was clear, and I was impressed by the surgeon's ability to manage the situation with her knowledge and cool nerves., Other Part-time Employment In addition to the other work experiences listed, I held several additional part time jobs after high school.  During the summer before starting college, I taught group tennis lessons to elementary and middle school students through the summer recreation program of Muncie Community Schools (Indiana).  The following summer, I continued my work with Muncie Community Schools, running a summer gym class for elementary schoolers.  I also helped with a summer strength and conditioning camp as a program assistant at the Muncie YMCA.  From August 2005 to May 2006, I worked about 5 hours a week at the center desk of my dormitory.  The contact information provided is for my manager at that job.,  Market Research, Multiple Volunteer Experiences Please note that the dates provided are not continuous but reflect the following: -During spring break week of my freshman year, I spent about 40 hours chaperoning kids from Middle Way House, a domestic abuse shelter in Bloomington, on activities to provide them with a fun, activity-filled spring break. -For spring semester of my final year of college, I volunteered with College Mentors for Kids. This involved about two hours a week of group activities with my mentee and other program participants. -Since January of 2011, I have volunteered at Ohio Alleycat Resource. This involves 1-2 hours per week of cleaning cages and other shelter areas. Contact info above is for this organization., Non-University Athletics Since graduating from college, I have continued to participate in several recreational sports.  I rock climb about once a week, continuing an activity I began early in college (hence the April 2006 start date for this category).  I usually climb indoors at a gym but occasionally climb outside as well.  Volleyball is another activity that I continue to participate in, playing in leagues as well as less structured pick-up games.  My enthusiasm for these sports has provided continuity in my transition from college to the work world, helping me to remain active and find social outlets in a new city., IU Tennis Center Employment To keep up my tennis game after high school, I took a tennis course at IU.  Afterwards, the instructor hired me to teach at the IU Tennis Center.  I worked there for the rest of my undergraduate career, teaching private and group lessons and helping to run clinics.  Juggling all of the lesson times was a challenge and improved my organizational skills.  As my first long-term employment, the experience also allowed me to gain confidence in engaging and instructing groups and taught me to manage relationships with clients., Study Abroad- Montreal To prepare for study abroad in French, I took an intensive course in oral French communication at the Universite de Montreal. My main objective was to warm up my real-life (non-classroom) French in the city before going to France.  The bizarre Quebecois accent complicated this preliminary study abroad experience, but it was still helpful to have the additional language practice, and it was interesting to experience the Quebecois French dialect in person. The month was also a test run for living in another country, far from home.  I had been away at USC but had readjusted to frequent family visits at IU, so Montreal helped me guarantee that homesickness would not derail my semester in France."

    "text": "Medicine has played a major role in my life since I was very young. It started when I was hospitalized at 18 months with periorbital cellulitis, had sinus surgery at 2 and was hospitalized again at 3 years of age with pneumonia. In the midst of this, my mother discovered her passion for medicine and changed careers to become a family physician. Although I was too young to remember her medical school experience, I remember visiting her during her residency.  I enjoyed going to visit my mother at the hospital, but it was hard on all of us when she had to stay overnight on call.  Those nights made me realize that becoming a doctor is not only a career decision, but also a lifestyle choice. Even though I knew the life of a doctor was tough, hearing my mother's stories helped push me toward a career in medicine, where I too could help make a difference in patients' lives.    I spent the rest of my elementary school years hoping to go into a medical field. It was not until high school that I decided I wanted to design and optimize medical devices. In addition to my academic goals, I had ambitions of being a successful collegiate athlete. With these two goals in mind, I accepted a scholarship to Stanford, a university with one on the best Biomechanical Engineering (BME) programs and most storied swimming traditions. While at Stanford, I pursued my education in BME and trained more than twenty hours per week swimming as a member of the varsity swim team.  During the summers, I shadowed several engineers who worked for various device design companies, as well as surgeons to see how they used the different devices. While shadowing the surgeons, I began to realize I was more drawn to the patient side of medicine and less to the development of devices. This made me take a step back and recognize my draw to medicine was in the act of taking care of patients. Although I was still intrigued by the engineering of devices, I discovered I wanted to devote my life to helping people directly.   In addition to following my academic and career ambitions at Stanford, I vigorously pursued my athletic goals. I was elected captain of the team for my junior and senior seasons. This experience proved to be invaluable as I learned to manage many tasks, personalities, and challenges. My junior year, I was able to win an individual PAC 10 Conference championship and finish fourth in two events at the NCAA Championships. My outstanding junior season had set me up to make a run for the Olympic team in 2012, a dream of mine since I was six.   Everything changed halfway through my senior season; when my shoulder started to bother me and I could no longer finish practices.  I was sent to see an orthopedic surgeon, who after viewing the MRI and diagnosing a SLAP tear, laid out my options. He explained how he would perform the surgery and what he would do to minimize its effects on my swimming shoulder mechanics. I was impressed by his knowledge of swimming and the personal interest he had taken in my case.  It was decided that surgery was my only viable option, but it meant that I would be out of the water for six months, missing my final college season.   After the surgery, my role on the team changed from an athlete to a coach and counselor. My teammates had always looked to me as a leader through my example and work ethic. It was far from an ideal situation for me to lead my team from the sidelines, but I felt a sense of responsibility to my teammates. If I could not score points, then I needed to find other ways to contribute. I spent a lot of time one on one with my teammates discussing various ways they could improve either in their swimming technique or the way they mentally approached their races. I was determined to assist my team in any way that would help us win the conference championship. When we did win, I felt as much a part of the team as when I was swimming. During my time as a coach, I realized how much I enjoyed pushing my teammates toward their goals. This again enforced the satisfaction of serving others, which I knew would be a big part of being a physician.  My experiences as team captain and an engineer have given me opportunities to develop the problem solving skills that I will need as a doctor. These skills combined with the passion for medicine that I have learned from my mother, the doctors that helped me breathe, and the orthopedic surgeon that was able to keep my Olympic dream alive have driven me toward a career in medicine.  I used to not understand how my mother was able to go through medical school while starting and managing a family, but now I better understand her passion. I, too, share the vision of making a difference in the lives of others and am more than willing to make the commitment to do what is necessary. I can only hope to get the same opportunity to help others the way these doctors have helped me. Student Panel to Interview Advising Prospects A select group of Stanford student athletes were asked to interview and evaluate candidates for an opening as an athlete academic advisor. I was asked to evaluate the candidate based on qualifications and how the candidate fit in with the ideals of Stanford student athletes., Student Focus Group to Improve the Alumni Association A small group of students were invited to give feedback on the Stanford Alumni Association. The focus of the meeting was to improve the relationships between the current students and the alumni association, so that when the students graduate, they would be able to utilize the alumni association more effectively. I was asked about my experiences with the alumni association and I provided suggestions for how to improve the relations between the association and the students in future years., Captain of Varsity Swim Team As a captain of the Stanford swim team, it was my job to communicate between the atheletes and coaches, to organize community service and team bonding activities, to manage the team's financial account and to make sure the team was unified and on track to have a successful season. I worked with the coaches to devise a practice schedule that would best prepare us for competitions and to make the for meets lineups that would optimize our team's talents. It was also my responsibility to enforce team rules and to help enforce punishments on the people that broke the team rules., Fukami Research Lab Assistant As a lab assistant, I learned and practiced basic laboratory skills, including, pippetting, plating, serial dilutions, and colony counting. The lab investigates the microorganisms that inhabit the nectar of Mimulus aurantiacus flowers. Dr. Fukami gave me the responsibility of conducting a flower survey, in which Mimulus flowers were harvested, the nectar was extracted, diluted and plated. After the colonies were grown, they were counted and analyzed., Swim and Tennis Club Manager As a manager I was in charge of the daily operations of the facility, including scheduling of the lifeguards, maintenance of the pool's water levels and chemicals and interaction with the patrons. I also had to compile the work hours for each lifeguard, in order to help coduct payroll., Exercise Induced Asthma Study Participant As a particpant in the study, I am being tested for excercie induced asthma and I also was tested for VO2 max. While I am not conducting the research, I have learned about the causes and effects of exercise induced asthma. I have also become familiar with some of the lab equipment and methods that are used in asthma and VO2 max testing., Cardinal Life Member Cardinal Life is a Christian organization at Stanford. We would meet in groups once or twice a week to discuss how faith fit into our lives at Stanford., Shadowing Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. I shadowed Dr. Heidt and observed surgery. I was able to see his daily surgical practices, which included knee and shoulder surgeries., Stanford Men's Swimming Varisty Athlete I was an All-American my freshman, sophomore and junior seasons for Stanford. An injury while training ended my senior season. I placed fourth at the NCAA Championships in two events and I was an individual conference champion my junior season. I led my team to a Pacific 10 Conference title all four years.  Being a stanford student athelete taught me how to manage my time and how to be successful as part of a team. It was a huge time commitment of 20 hours a week plus traveling to competitions every other weekend., Hurricane Relief Volunteer Work I was attending a swimming training camp with the Stanford Swim Team in Baton Rouge, Louisiana a couple weeks after hurricane Gustav hit. The team decided to help with the relief effort, so we worked with some of the local organizations. I distributed food, loaded cars with food and ice and handed out meals to people who had been devastated my the storm., Volunteering at the VA Hospital In honor of everything our coach has done for Stanford swimming and everything the armed forces have done for this country, every year I have been at Stanford, on New Year's Day, some of my teammates and I would go to the local veteran's hospital. We would make them sandwiches, serve them food, watch the football games with them, and keep them company., International Swimming In the summer of 2008, I competed for a spot on the 2008 US Olympic Team. My highest finish was 12th, 10 spots away from making the team. I am continuing my training full time in hopes of making the 2012 Olympic team.  Because of my performance at the 2010 World Championship Trials, I was selected to compete for the United States at the World University Games in Shenzen, China in August 2011., Swimming Instruction Clinics Since high school, I have done many different clinics teaching people how to swim. I have instructed swimmers that are just beginning and have never swum an entire lap, adults that have been lap swimming for years, and just about everything in between. I have done private lessons and large group clinics. I organized and ran a free clinic for the members of the Swim Club where I learned to swim. I ran these clinics in summers during high school and when I was home from college. I have also volunteered at the Stanford swim camps to teach the campers about swimming technique and about what it takes to be a successful swimmer., Pacific 10 Conference All-Academic Team This is an award given to varsity swimmers in the Pacific 10 Conference based on their GPA. I received the honor in 2009 and 2010., Second Mile Volunteer Working with Second Mile, I was able to help rebuild/remodel two homes of less fortunate families in East Palo Alto and I also helped to rebuild/remodel an elementary school in East Palo Alto. My duties in the project included building a fence and painting."

    "text": "I want to change the world. That is, I want to change someone's world. Doctors make significant impacts on the lives of those they treat every day without even realizing it. The day doctors told my father he had tumors in his lungs and brain, they changed his and my family's world. The day they told us that the treatments were working, they changed our world again and gave us hope. In my father's case, the treatments were not enough. Nevertheless, up until the day he passed away I continued to have faith in his doctors and medical science. I still do, with the understanding that there are limits to how much medicine can do. I hope that in the near future I too will become a doctor and help push these limits so that I can help change someone's world for the better.   It has been almost seven years since I first volunteered in a hospital. As a determined 16-year old, the year after my father passed away I became a Junior Ambassador at the Cleveland Clinic. My experience there was so rewarding that I returned to volunteer two additional summers over the course of these past several years. There is something about the hospital atmosphere that draws me back.  During my time at the Clinic I was given the opportunity to serve in several different areas of the hospital. The very first summer I was there, I worked at an information desk, as well as in the back office of the Hematology/Oncology department where I checked in patient films. I quickly realized how important everyone's job in a hospital is in order to keep things running smoothly.  More importantly, as I looked forward to my shifts at the information desk, I discovered that I preferred to be interacting with patients. As a result, the second and third summers that I returned to the Clinic, I chose to volunteer in areas where I could interact with patients, doctors, and nurses.  I was therefore given the opportunity to work in the Cardiology Department's Catheter Lab and the Radiology Department. While working in the Catheter Lab, I made sure that patients coming back from procedures were feeling ok and that they had some food. Similarly, while serving in the Radiology Department, I provided company and assistance to patients getting ready to go in for scans. These placements allowed me to see firsthand how different doctors approached patients and their families. Some were very caring and took their time in talking to the patients. Others, however, only spent the minimum amount of time necessary to say what was needed and then promptly left. I can't say this enough, but I truly believe that apart from superior medical knowledge, doctors must have compassion. As a result of having had the opportunity to interact with a variety of patients and having witnessed the treatment my father received from his doctors and hospital staff, I will always carry with me the positive experiences so that I will remember to treat each my future patients with the utmost care and consideration.   My interest in medicine itself has influenced my life for many years now. After taking my first biology class in high school, I quickly became fascinated by the intricate processes of cells and the human body.  My interest in biology and medicine only grew after being introduced to the field of biological and clinical research.  Therefore, as a result of these interests and my positive experience volunteering in the hospital, upon matriculating to Boston University I chose to become a Biology major on the premedical track. After a rocky start with classes, due to poor time management skills and perhaps too much confidence in my knowledge of the subjects, I learned some important lessons. First of all, I am now able to multi-task and balance my time in an efficient manner so that I work hard but still am able to enjoy relaxing with family and friends. Furthermore, I've learned that it is ok to ask for help when concepts don't make sense, for that is what learning is all about.  We all learn from each other. With these lessons at the forefront, I've worked hard to improve my grades so that I can now earn the honor of being accepted to medical school.    Although academics should be given priority, for we can only gain knowledge through rigorous study, I believe it is also important to be able to pass on our knowledge. Therefore, during these past 4 years at BU, apart from mastering my academic work, I also devoted time to working with students as an Undergraduate Assistant and as a tutor. As an Undergraduate Assistant to two important biology classes, one of them being Systems Physiology, I had the chance to work with students to help them understand important cellular and physiological concepts. Explaining these concepts in many different ways so as to make them understandable was not an easy task, but it was a rewarding experience. Learning to communicate and pass on knowledge to others is important because apart from actively treating patients, I believe a doctor also has to be a teacher and educate his/her patients on how to proactively take care of themselves. Therefore, I hope to combine the skills I've learned from these experiences, along with my determination and the knowledge I will gain in medical school, to make a positive impact in the field of medicine. Student-2-Student Tutoring After having been an Undergraduate Assistant for the Introductory Biology Lab, I was picked to be a tutor for the Introductory Biology course's Student-2-Student tutoring program.  As a tutor for this program I, along with 4 other students, took turns attending the BI 108 (Biology 2) lectures and taking notes to post for the students as an additional resource.  We also held review sessions for the students before their exams.  Furthermore, every week I held office hours where students would be able to come in and ask questions., Undergraduate Assistant for Systems Physiology Laboratory As an Undergraduate Assistant for one of the Systems Physiology Lab sections, I assisted the teaching fellow with running the lab.  Tasks included setting up the materials for lab and helping the students run the necessary software and lab protocols as well as answering student questions about the material., Retail Sales During my summers back home from college I worked in a retail store (Victoria's Secret).  I worked at the same store consistently since the summer after my freshman year of college up until and including the summer before my senior year.  It was a good experience to work with a lot of different types of people.  As with any retail job, customer service is important and I learned how to interact with people in all sorts of different moods and from different backgrounds., Undergraduate Assistant for Honors Introductory Biology Lab During the spring of my sophomore year, I was asked to be an Undergraduate Assistant (UA) for the Honors Introductory Biology Laboratory course.  As a UA I helped the teaching fellow with various tasks and helped the students with their lab procedures.  I also had the opportunity to teach one of the labs., Research Technician I am currently working as a full-time Research Technician in the Molecular Profiling Laboratory that is part of Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Cancer Research.  My position entails performing general core services such as genetic analysis using Affymetrix technology.  As I have only just started, I eventually hope to start on my own project within the scope of the lab's study of the actions of estrogenic compounds on fetal development and mammary epithelial cells., Latin Honors-Magna Cum Laude I graduated with Latin Honors-Magna Cum Laude from Boston University's College of Arts and Sciences., Intern at Centro Nacional de Microbiologia in Madrid, Spain I studied abroad in Madrid, Spain during the Fall semester of my junior year.  Part of the program I was in consisted of having a local internship.  Therefore, I interned at the National Microbiology Center in Madrid in a lab that was investigating HIV.  This was my first time working in a research lab and so I was taught basic research skills.  I had a mini-project for which I was supposed to clone GFP into a vector with which I was to eventually transfect cells.  Therefore, not only was I introduced to techniques such as gel electrophoresis, DNA digestions/ligations, DNA purification, and cell culture, but my Spanish speaking abilities were greatly improved., Junior Ambassador at the Cleveland Clinic I volunteered as a Junior Ambassador at the Cleveland Clinic the summers of 2004 and 2006. During the summer of 2010 I returned as a regular adult Ambassador.  During my time there I worked in various areas of the hospital from Information desks to working in the Cardiac Catheter lab where I assisted patients coming back from various procedures, as well as in the Taussig Cancer center checking in patient films.  Last summer in 2010 I was placed in the Radiology department where I assisted patients before going in for their CT/MRI scans., Undergraduate Research I was able to work as an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Ho's lab at Boston University. Dr. Ho's lab studies Mint proteins which are thought to play a role in generating the plaques seen in patients with Alzheimer's Disease. My project involved staining sections of mouse brain and neuron cultures with antibodies to the Mint proteins as well as Amyloid Precursor Protein. The goal was to see where exactly these proteins localize to in mammalian brain and the neuron itself while also observing colocalization. This was a great experience as I was able to use skills I had previously learned about in classes and my internship in Spain., Dean's List I was on Boston University's College of Arts and Sciences Dean's List for Fall 2009, Spring 2010, Fall 2010, and Spring 2011, Laboratory Assistant Since the middle of my sophomore year I have worked as a laboratory assistant for the Organic Chemistry Labs.  This was a work-study job that allowed me to study while at the same time helping organize materials for the students' labs., Educational Resource Center Peer Tutor The Educational Resource Center at Boston University has a peer tutoring program for which I was a tutor.  The subjects I tutored included regular and Honors Introductory Biology and 3rd, 4th, and 5th semester Spanish.  I had a great time working with students.  Not only did I help them understand concepts by explaining them in a different way than maybe the professors had, but I was able to reinforce the subjects for myself.  I find that tutoring really is like teaching and both the tutor and the tutee learn."

    "text": "It would be so cool to drive a bus through Ralphies body, I thought, mesmerized as I watched Ms. Frizzle and her class navigate through the body in the Magic School Bus.  Little did I know, as a child, that science would evolve to use technologies similar to that tiny yellow bus to get inside the body and assist in complex surgeries. As I progressed through high school and college, I gained more exposure to the field of medicine through research, academia, and shadowing. Through these experiences, I came to realize that my enthusiasm for understanding the complexities of the human body and desire to interact with patients had shaped my aspiration to become a physician.  When I reflect on my desire to practice medicine, my thoughts always return to my cousin Saraubh. He was born with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by life threatening obesity, stunted physical growth, and impaired cognitive ability. At a young age, my understanding of this disorder was limited; however, as I grew older, I painfully realized that Saurabh would never drive a car, hold a job, nor live independently. I began to question why Saurabh was different. What caused this disorder Was there a cure It was this curiosity that laid the foundation for my interest in medicine.   As I learned more about PWS, I was intrigued by the role genetics play in the development of the body and mind. My aspiration to better comprehend the underlying factors that cause diseases such as PWS inspired me to join a research lab that focuses on identifying the etiology behind Alzheimers disease. As I conducted my independent study project, which is being considered for publication, I improved my critical thinking skills and ability to collaborate with my peers. Furthermore, I realized that I had developed a genuine passion for understanding pathologies and their effects on the human body.  My eagerness to understand the relationship between the body and mind led me to study neurobiology in college. I learned about complex phenomena that cause disorders similar to PWS; genetic mutations, aberrant protein folding, and hormonal control all concertedly play a causal role. Additional undergraduate coursework in psychology enabled me to gain a holistic perspective on the delicate balance between the body and mind. I found that lab research and classroom learning, while necessary, were insufficient to satisfy my craving for the patient interaction inherent in being a physician. Thus, I began shadowing doctors in a clinical environment.  One shadowing experience in particular left a tremendous impact on my desire to become a physician. I vividly recall meeting J.M., a patient who suffered a gunshot wound to the head that had damaged his central nervous system, causing him to feel excruciating pain throughout his body. His attempts to communicate were muddled by incomprehensible speech. While his symptoms were clinically interesting, I was humbled by the fact that J.M. was only a few years older than me and had lost the ability to interact with others for the rest of his life. Watching the anguish on his mothers face as he stumbled for words was equally heart wrenching. Yet I was encouraged by the reassuring and personable nature of the physician, who made J.M. feel comfortable with the treatment process. My shadowing experiences have demonstrated the positive impact of a patient-oriented approach to medicine, a quality that will guide me in my path to becoming a physician.   Over the past year, I have continued to prepare myself for a career in medicine. Although I initially struggled to adjust to the rigors of college and overcommitted myself to extracurricular activities, I have since demonstrated my resolve to succeed by the upward trend in my GPA while taking upper-level science courses. In addition, I have continued to gain clinical and patient exposure by volunteering in the emergency room at a local hospital and shadowing doctors. I will continue to build upon these experiences by working alongside physicians and nurses as a Project Manager for Epic, a company specializing in medical software. This will give me a deeper understanding of the process involved in collecting patient information and administering medical care.    Although I may never maneuver a tiny yellow bus through the human body, I am excited to learn about the intricacies of the human body as a medical student and treat patients as a physician. My natural curiosity and close personal relationship with my cousin Saurabh instilled in me a desire to seek solutions to questions that science has yet to answer. Watching J.M. struggle to speak left me with a feeling of sadness that strengthened my resolve to help individuals like him. Having seen the benefits of administered care on several patients gives me optimism that advances in science and medicine will continue to improve the standard of care and tackle unresolved challenges. My rigorous academic curriculum and clinical exposure have prepared me to succeed in medical school and motivated me to become a competent physician. Ultimately, my fascination with the science behind medicine and my desire to improve the quality of care is the magic force that drives me to become a physician. Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity As a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, I have held positions as Vice President (2011-2013) and Intramural Chairman (2009- 2011). My duties as Vice President include organizing all committees, reviewing and amending our constitution, and serving as head of the judicial board. I have also taken an additional initiative to increase officer accountability, as well as the responsibility of restructuring the internal constitution of my fraternity. As Intramural Chairman, I increased brother participation and attendance at intramural games, organized intramural schedules and pairings with sororities, and put our fraternity into competition for Team of the Year., Residence Hall Government As President of Lindgren Hall sophomore year and Vice President of Bobb Hall my freshman year, I was responsible for organizing and executing residence hall events, creating a more collegiate environment in the residence hall, and coordinating activities with other dorms. This included organizing weekly munchies, hosting formals, and setting up intramural teams. In addition, I attended weekly meetings with the executive board and the residence hall association., Summer Worker At Abbott, I worked as a team member to implement an electronic laboratory notebook system that could function across various departments. Additionally, I participated in meetings regarding regulatory controls to prevent drug contamination and became familiar with FDA regulations for drug production. Overall, my experience at Abbott gave me a more comprehensive perspective on the healthcare industry., Wheeling Political Action Club Due to their upbringing and socioeconomic situation, many of my peers in high school were not exposed to social and political issues. Thus, during my senior year, I founded a philanthropic organization dedicated to increasing awareness about social and political challenges in society. In its first year, the Wheeling Political Action Club held a campaign to support awareness for the Darfur region in Africa, conducted a social study on the Bradley effect during the 2008 presidential election, and initiated an energy conservation drive. The organization has continued to thrive and grow in the past four years, becoming both a community service group and a political action organization., Independent Researcher I spent roughly 20-30 hours a week studying signaling pathways involved in Alzheimer's disease and neuronal degradation. This involved running routine Western Blots, performing immunocytochemistry experiments, and analyzing data. In addition, I gained experiences writing grant proposals, designed independent experiments for my research, and regularly reviewed scientific articles to gain a better understanding of different approaches in Alzheimer's research., Research Assistant I spent roughly fifteen hours a week in the laboratory acquiring and utilizing important research skills. I began mastering immunohistochemical techniques, handling and training rats and mice, and performing surgeries and injections in the animal's hippocampus and anterior cortex. Moreover, I became accustomed to reading scientific literature, the rigors of the scientific method, and gained valuable experience in various laboratory techniques, such as Western Blotting., Internal Medicine Shadowing I spent several weekends shadowing Dr. Shah at Swedish Covenant Hospital, learning about internal medicine. Here, I interacted routinely with patients with hypertension, diabetes, and various internal health issues. I also accompanied Dr. Shah on his rounds to inpatients following gastrointestinal surgery. Furthermore, I had an opportunity to learn more about treatments given to patients to reduce many of their symptoms., Pain Management Specialist Shadowing In this shadowing experience, I accompanied Dr. Patel on rounds to meet with individuals suffering from extreme pain. Patients I visited included a gunshot wound patient, several post surgical patients, and patients with severe arthritis. Additionally, I was able to observe several surgeries, including a kyphoplasty, designed to help relieve an individual's pain. In addition to visiting the clinic, I also joined Dr. Patel on rounds to his inpatients, where I learned about the SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) system of diagnosis and treatment. Finally, I gained a better grasp on the specialization of pain management, a subset of anesthesiology., Orthopaedic Surgeon Shadowing In this shadowing experience, I accompanied Dr. Regan on rounds to meet patients with knee, back, and hip issues. I saw Dr. Regan administer multiple shots to relieve pain, as well as draw fluid from the a patient's joint. He also explained to me why he was prescribing certain muscle relaxants and painkillers. Moreover, I watched Dr. Regan explain to patients the importance of lifestyle changes, such as lifting smaller weights and altering their diet., Emergency Department Volunteer One of the major responsibilities of my role as an emergency room volunteer is assisting physicians and nurses when needed. This includes walking patients to their rooms, changing beds, and keeping the rooms well-stocked. I have become more aware of the emotional and physical demands of being a physician, as well as the relationship between doctors, nurses, technicians, and patients.,  Project Management, Supplies For Dreams Supplies for Dreams is a 501(c) non-profit organization dedicated to improving the educational experience of underprivileged kids in the Chicago area. As President of the Northwestern Chapter of Supplies for Dreams, I led the effort to increase awareness about problems in the Chicago Public School System, organized fundraising events, and served as a member of the Executive Board for Supplies for Dreams. We worked closely with other organizations on campus to host joint events, promote mutual interests, and increase awareness about our organization., SASA The South Asian Student Alliance (SASA) is a cultural organization at Northwestern dedicated to increasing awareness of South Asian culture on campus. For the past four years, I have participated in the annual SASA show as a member of the class dances. In addition, I organized the Junior Class dance this past year. In order to help freshmen make an easier transition to college, I joined the SASA Buddy program, where I served as a mentor to several incoming freshmen and helped them become accustomed to college., Tufaan Entertainment Tufaan Entertainment is a cultural non-profit organization, dedicated to helping underprivileged children in Southeast Asia gain a worldly education. Tufaan hosts an annual intercollegiate Bollywood style dance competition, which is used to fundraise for a charity benefiting the children in Southeast Asia. As a member of the Executive Board, I served as Accommodations Chair. I was responsible for organizing and negotiating a contract with the hotel that hosted the competitors, organizing flight schedules and transportation for the dancers, and overseeing that the competition ran smoothly., Peer Advisor Wildcat Welcome organizes all Welcome Week events for incoming freshmen at Northwestern. As a peer adviser, I was responsible for communicating with and advising twenty-two students as well as helping them adjust to college life. During Welcome Week, I would accompany my advisees to all official Wildcat Welcome events; hosted regular discussions about topics such as alcohol abuse, drug use, sexual boundaries, and diversity; and offered advice and counsel to freshmen who had questions about their academic future.

    "text": "I remember feeling deceived. For years, we were told that the family has no history of cancer and we need not worry. But now my grandmother has cancer and there was nothing to be done. Nothing in my years of scientific study prepared me for the feeling of powerlessness I felt watching her suffering from this unexpected diagnosis. She had lived a good life eating a healthy diet with vegetables aplenty and neither smoked nor drank. She was supposed to die in her sleep many years from now in time to see her first great-grandchildren come into this world. Now we all know this to be only a sliver of hope. Her diagnosis came in my junior year of undergraduate studies: the most painful and transformative year of my life. Unlike most of my peers, I came to my decision to pursue medicine late into my academic career. In my youth, I dreamed of winning Nobel prizes for groundbreaking research that would change our understanding of life. Thus my undergraduate career focused on science. Between my sophomore and junior years, I spent the summer conducting basic cancer research. I worked to predict the prevalence of colon cancer based on micro-metastases in the sentinel lymph nodes. Though the work was grueling and technical, I loved every second. I knew that while physicians dispensed the treatments, only a scientist could find the cures. \tDuring the spring of my junior year, I labored in synthetic organic chemistry to make novel inhibitors of oncogenes. Then my mother surprised me: we were flying back to the Philippines to see my grandmother. When we arrived, she was three days from surgery. The gap between her diagnoses and her surgery was quite long because of the money needed to pay for the procedure; the Philippines has no social safety net to mitigate the costs. She cooked dinner each night, aware of the fist sized mass in her small intestine. We were supposed to be there to cheer her on, but I ultimately felt incapable to stop the tumor. Once she recovered from the surgery, the doctors recommended a course of chemotherapy. I watched in horror as the medication caused terrible bouts of nausea. Though distressed, I found that I could help her feel more comfortable by helping in daily tasks and listening for her needs. I resolved to be more than helpless, to heal as well as to provide comfort. If not for my own grandmother, then for someone else's loved ones suffering from disease; I chose to pursue medicine. \tNow in post-graduate life, I volunteer in Oncology Recreation Therapy to bring a small measure of joy to those badly inflicted by cancer treatments. Hope is high in these wards as I bring around my cart. I also found multiple shadowing opportunities to follow the physicians around the hospital. I may not be able to treat these patients, but I could help them recover from stem cell therapy or observe as the physician treats them. I talk, laugh, and even pray with these patients suffering from what might be the worst time of their lives. My experiences with my grandmother granted me great sympathy and empathy with these patients and any comfort I can give by my actions rewards me in return. Each thank you and look of their relief recharges me to go to the next room.  \tI pursued research during this time and found employment in Duke University's Department of Biochemistry. I discovered genes in E. coli that synthesize phospholipids in new mechanisms found from experiments I concocted. Currently, I have published one paper as a first author and hope to publish one more. The exploration of new genes and elucidating their chemistry is still engaging. However, I found I do not have the correct temperament to be a scientist. The expected laboratory solitude does not work with my extrovert personality. I need people. Thus in the future, I hope to marry science with the working life of treatment. With the logical skills gleaned from my experience in science and my natural extroversion, I would diagnose and treat patients affably and quickly.  \tNow, my grandmother's cancer no longer responds to treatment. She chose to stop chemotherapy as the treatment brought her much pain and little help. The metastasized mass grows, but she is cheerful and active. Her decision taught me the limits of medicine and when it is best for the patient to let nature take its course. We do not know how much time she has remaining, but I wish to fly back to the Philippines. I wish to tell her that I will be a doctor who brings healing, hope, and a new chance at life with every patient I see.  Today, I have developed an interest in pediatrics from my volunteering and shadowing in the hospital. Thus, I have also started to shadow pediatricians and volunteer in the pediatric wings. These brave young souls are ever optimistic. They often break my heart and lift my soul at the same time. If I could have just one iota of the optimism found in the kids I have seen, then I could endure all the pain found in life with the hope that tomorrow could be better. I wish to be the man who can make tomorrow better for these kids in the hospital.  Event Manager, Vice-president of Chi Psi Fraternity Founded in 1861, Chi Psi fraternity is one of the oldest collegiate fraternities in operation today. The chapter in Duke University was founded in 1989 and carries on the traditions and mission values of its founders. As the vice-president of the fraternity, I was charged with the running of social activities, recruitment, and community service. Aside from scholarship, these three departments are considered to be the most important of the fraternity. As a leader, I managed 3 committees with 8 men in with a combined budget of $40,000. My greatest achievement was working with my community service chair to raise $7,000 for Habitat for Humanity.,  Lab Technician, Oncology Recreational Therapy Oncology recreational therapy improves the lives of cancer patients through more than just medical treatment. We believe that health outcomes are generally more positive if the patient feels more comfortable about their environment. To that end, I spend a few hours per week interacting with patients through the use of the hospitality cart. The cart contains many treats and activities that stave off the monotony of depression which often accompanies long-term stem cell treatments. I also work in the Living History program that creates a brief living history for the caregivers to read and understand the patient's situation., Vespers Choir The highly selective Vespers choir from Duke University specializes in high Renaissance, Baroque, and 20th century motets. As a member of the group for 6 years, I am honored to be surrounded by such talented singers. In normal functions, the choir leads a weekly prayer service with song and biblical readings. The choir also performs free concerts for the community in nursing homes, clinics, and hospitals. In addition, the choir has toured the great churches of Germany.  Making music in this collaborative setting helped me to understand that I cannot fulfill all specialties. I have limits. We must work together to make something beautiful., Hsieh Laboratory Undergraduate Research Assistant The Hsieh laboratory focuses on the topoisomerases and helicases. These enzymes manipulate the physical nature of DNA by increasing or decreasing the supercoiling tension. My project revolved around the purification and characterization of the  Topo1A enzymes of N. equitans, a thermophilic microgranism. We gained new insights into the temperature dependence of these enzymes., Raetz Laboratory Technician The Raetz Laboratory specializes in membrane modification processes research, especially in E. coli and other microorganisms. My own work originally dealt with the lipidome levels of cardiolipin (CL), a widely distributed lipid discovered in 1946. Using interdisciplinary yet complementary techniques, we have discovered two additional cardiolipin synthesis genes in E. coli. In addition, we have the first E. coli system without CL which allows us to elucidate the still unknown function of this abundant lipid. Currently, our theory rests on the importance of this lipid in oxidative phosphorylation and we have published my first first author work."

    "text": "I owe my existence to medicine. In January 1989, my mother drove down to Cincinnati from northern Michigan to the clinic of Dr. Jennifer Thie to make a painful and expensive run at motherhood. I was made in a petri dish from harvested eggs, born six weeks early and delivered by cesarean section. In every possible way, my origin was artificial; at every turn, the tragedy that my parents would have had to endure without modern medicine was apparent. Medicine is miraculous to me because people are able to live their whole lives in the difference that it makes. Thats why I want to be a part of it.  When I shadowed Dr. Bruining, a neurologist in northern Michigan, I felt the same wonder that I did about my own story. To me, there is something incredibly elegant about being able to diagnose a problem with someones brain through physical examination. Dr. Bruining would get out her kit of hammers, ask people a series of questions, and have them push against her hands with different muscles. What amazed me was that she could use such simple tools to analyze the brain, the most complicated structure in the universe.  I was even more impressed, however, with how she behaved when things were not elegant. There is no perfect patient. Many of the patients she cared for were uninsured; several were alcoholics. There was always a question of whether a patients new symptoms were caused by disease or were simply side effects of the dozens of medications many of her patients were on. On one occasion we saw a patient who Dr. Bruining diagnosed with non-epileptic seizures. She told me how difficult it is to explain to a patient that their seizures originate from psychology rather than epilepsy without making the patient angry and defensive. But she did a beautiful job of it. The patient had acknowledged that the seizures were often brought on by stress, and Dr. Bruining explained them in those terms. The patient and her family bought in to the diagnosis and the treatment. Great medicine means finding a way to do the very best for each and every patient, regardless of how they got where they are.  I was inspired on many occasions with Dr. Bruinings ability to communicate. She said she believed that communication was the most important skill for a doctor to have, and she practiced what she preached. I agree with her. Over the past year, Ive worked very hard on becoming a better communicator. I make my living tutoring, and the only real advantage that I have over a pile of textbooks is my ability to communicate. My goal is to help my clients dramatically improve their grades and test scores. The only way for me to do that is to help them find precisely what their weaknesses are and then find ways to practice those weaknesses until they become strengths. Whatever knowledge or talent I have is useless if I cant convey it to my clients. I want to be the kind of doctor whose notes are comprehensive and beautifully clear; I want to make a special effort to make sure that each one of my patients and their families understands as much about what is happening as they possibly can in order to empower them to make informed choices about their own health.  The toughest communication that I have to do is at Ypsilanti Middle School, where I tutor kids in math and writing as a volunteer for 826Michigan. The school serves a predominately minority population of low socioeconomic status. Many kids that come to 826Michigan are there against their will; all of them are afraid of opening up or appearing weak. The classroom is often chaotic, and getting the kids to focus is nearly impossible at times. The kids are often disrespectful towards me (and everyone else). But I became more successful when I realized who I was there for. I was there for the kids who really did want to learn, who really did want to do better. I wasnt there to be a magic bullet. By staying positive for each kid and giving each kid my very best, I was able to make a difference in the understanding of kids who were open to it.  When I was conceived, in vitro fertilization had a 15% success rate. 15% seems very low. No one would expect to get a good grade on a test that they got a 15% on; a quarterback with a 15% completion rate wouldnt last long. But I think medicine is often about those 15% where you can make a difference. I want to go to medical school because even if I could make that kind of difference in only 5% of the people that I come across, thats still a huge impact. My whole life has happened because I was one of the 15% that did make it.  In the eighteen months since graduation, Ive learned some things that are valuable to me and that I believe will be valuable to those that I serve in the future. That said, Im not satisfied with the way that I left things from an academic standpoint. Over the course of this year, Ive learned some valuable lessons about time management, learning and memory. I put some of those lessons into practice on the MCAT, with great success. But what I really want to show is that I can be successful in the marathon that is a medical career and not just in a four hour MCAT sprint. That's why this August, I'm beginning the M.S. in Physiology program at University of Cincinnati. Assn for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Annual Meeting Attended ARVO conference May 6th-10th 2012. Presented poster, Mathematically Modeling Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells., University of Michigan LS&A Dean's Scholarship Awarded University of Michigan LS&A Dean's Scholarship for exceptional merit, $10,000/year over 4 years., Computational Neuroscience Research Full-time research assistant summer 2010, summer 2011, and May 2012 to December 2012; part time during the school years. Worked to create a model for the electrophysiology of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. First author of a poster Mathematically Modeling Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells that I presented at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology annual meeting in Fort Lauderdale, FL. My project is the result of an interdisciplinary collaboration between the departments of mathematics and ophthalmology. A paper, A Model for the Electrophysiology of Intrinsically Photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells is currently in preparation., Downhill Skiing I grew up skiing in Northern Michigan. One particular highlight of my downhill skiing experience was when our team won the Michigan High School State Championship in 2003 and was runner up again in 2004. There isn't all that much opportunity to ski in Ann Arbor, but I've gone out to Salt Lake City to ski several times, which is so good that it's pretty much ruined Michigan skiing for me. I love skiing and I think the only reason I'd ever want to retire is to become a ski bum., Physician Shadowing I shadowed Dr. Bruining, a neurologist, for 24 hours. I also shadowed Dr. David Kam, a surgeon, for 8 hours, Dr. Carl Kinzel, a family doctor, for 20 hours, Dr. Neal Fellows, a psychiatrist, for 8 hours, and Dr. Kyle Carr, a pathologist, for 8 hours., Jazz Pianist Jazz pianist and co-founder of the Big Noise Jazz Combo. Played professionally at private parties, jazz festivals, Music In The Park, and many other events around Northern Michigan., Research Assistant Processed and analyzed CT data in order to develop ways better of assessing frailty and predicting surgical outcomes; instructed and provided support for students using lab technology., Private Tutor Tutored clients in math and science coursework at the high school and college level as well as for the ACT, GRE, SAT and ACT., St. Joseph Mercy Hospital Volunteer Volunteer at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital on 5 North, the neurology/urology floor. Transport and escort patients out of the hospital. Assist the nursing staff in any way possible: stocking nursing carts, hanging out with lonely patients, or filing charts., Food Gatherers Volunteer Volunteered at Food Gatherers, a food bank and food rescue program. Prepared and served food at the Community Kitchen. Also worked as a food runner on a truck, collecting food from restaurants and distributing it to other charitable organizations throughout the Washtenaw County area., Volunteer Tutor Volunteered to tutor Ypsilanti Middle School kids in math and writing. Assisted with Bright Futures, a youth mentorship program for young men., Wolverine Cuizine Wolverine Cuizine is an organization at U of M that brings students who love food together. I have a deep passion for Northern Italian Cuisine, for homemade pasta, scratch cooking, and the magic of real Parmiggiano-Reggiano cheese. Wolverine Cuizine allowed me to share that passion with other people and to learn from them through blogging, potlucks, and the annual publication of a food magazine., Farm Work Worked on family farm, Omena Cut Flowers, summer 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. Responsible for weeding and tending beds, planting annuals, dividing perennials, preparing bouquets and potted plants for sale, and delivering bouquets to customers., Child Life Volunteer - Oncology and Hematology Worked to provide comfort to patients and families undergoing treatment at Mott Children's hospital. Whether by watching the kids so that parents could take a break, playing with the children and engaging them to take their mind off their situation and just be kids again, or by just being there for the parents as someone to talk to, my job was to make a difficult situation just a little bit easier."

    "text": "My aunt directs a youth baseball league for mentally and physically handicapped children called Challenger Baseball in Cleveland. The summer before college, she asked that I help her out during the games. On game day we were each paired off with a handicapped player. My initial player was a very shy kid who could barely operate his electric wheelchair. We spent the majority of our day at third base with a hat on and glove in hand. I took the initiative to strike up conversation and play catch; however, every conversation ended where it started and catch was equally unsuccessful. I even tried pulling the same-name card--since his name was also Max--but to no avail. Though he seemed unmoved by my attempts at interaction, I persisted until one time I tossed him the ball and he squeezed his glove tight to hold it in. At that moment, a large smile broke out across his face and I knew that I reached him.  \tThe shared connection that I felt with Max during Challenger Baseball reflects the virtues of the ideal physician presented in Sir Luke Fildes' 1887 painting The Doctor. In the painting, Fildes emphasizes the immense comfort that his dying son's doctor provided to both the child and his family during such a stressful time. Dr. Abraham Verghese, a renowned author, physician, and professor at Stanford University Medical School, in one of his lectures pointed out the attentiveness that the idealized physician of the painting provides for his patient. Not able to provide tangible aid to the child, the physician's importance in the painting transcends traditional symbols of a curative nature, such as instruments or medication, by providing psychological and emotional support and a shared hope for the child's survival.  \tThis emotional and psychological support becomes especially important for chronic and terminal diseases such as cancer, in which the disease assumes a burden greater than just the biological component. While working as a research assistant for Dr. Palesh's group at the Stanford Medical Center, I assisted with a study that aimed to improve the quality of life in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy by addressing sleep disturbance through pharmacological and cognitive behavioral treatments. During this time, I had the opportunity to observe cognitive behavioral therapy sessions that addressed cancer's side effect of sleep disruption. But the most intriguing aspect of this study was progressing through the course of a particular woman's chemotherapy regimen, which coincided with the length of the study. \tShe was an extremely pleasant lady in her mid fifties. Her presence warmed the hospital room and her smile was impossible to not reciprocate. With her daughter, sister, and mother at her side for the cognitive behavioral therapy visits we saw tremendous improvements in sleep and energy. Unfortunately, when she began a new drug regimen, her symptoms took a turn for the worse, overcoming initial improvements from the behavior modifications. In a later visit, she broke down and the flow of tears from her eyes explained everything. To see such great pain endured by such a wonderful person was extremely disheartening--all the more so given the knowledge that her cancer was progressing. Given the gravity of the situation I did my best at understanding and accepting her situation while our team supported her throughout this difficult time. Although I was not her physician, our research team grew very close to her throughout her cancer's course. While I wished that I could have done more, being there when she broke down in tears and listening to her share her worries, gave her a temporary comfort and relief.    In a similar manner to Filde's painting of a physician waiting at the bedside of a patient with a disease out of his control, I have started to appreciate the role of the physician as a patient caretaker leading a team of people passionately concerned with helping people prevent, treat, and recover from disease. In my experience working closely with Stanford Hospital's infusion clinic, the physician, despite his/her best efforts, cannot be present at every hiccup that an illness creates for the patient, and thus, must invest in others, from nurses and social workers to the patient's friends and family, to aid in caring for the patient. My major at Stanford, Human Biology, taught me the benefits of this type of team-oriented approach in addressing the complex interactions between an individual's biological make-up, psychosocial support, and the environment in which he/she lives. My area of focus within the major sought to reconcile the macroscopic perspectives of epidemiology with more microscopic understandings of an individual's behavioral motivations and personal psychology in order to develop effective means of preventing disease or halting its further progression. Medical school is the next step in my education and can provide me with the necessary tools to better address patients' concerns and to better understand the interaction between human biology and psychosocial demeanor. The technical knowledge learned in medical school as well as the opportunities to apply this knowledge under superior guidance will complement and enhance my personal compassion in treating and helping patients. Research Assistant-Dr. Spiegel and Palesh group As a research assistant for Dr. Spiegel and Palesh's group I was exposed to a variety of experiences, one of which was assisting with study flow and data analyses. My responsibilities included preparation for and analysis of visits for the group's two concurrent studies. Study visit assessments involved organizing the patient's record, data entry, and after completion of the study, data analysis. Being involved with all aspects of the process allowed me to help pinpoint and correct deviations should they occur. Total commitment (including clinical and administrative aspects) was equivalent to a full-time job during September (40hrs./week) and part-time (15hrs./week) during the school year., Event Coordinator for Field of Dreams As one of the event coordinators for Field of Dreams, an event dedicated to disabled youth, I helped manage a group of motivated individuals who put on a successful play-day and effective benefit fundraiser. The event was partnered with Kids with Dreams, a group dedicated to serving physically and mentally disabled youth, with aims of raising money for The Magical Bridge, a project looking to build playgrounds that are suited for all children to play in. I specifically coordinated the sports section of the event by planning and executing many group and individual activities. Planning required a couple hours a week (more in the days before the event) leading up to an all-day event., (Clinical) Research Assistant-Dr. Spiegel and Palesh group Dr. Spiegel and Palesh's group focuses on assessing clinical therapies for improving quality of life, more specifically sleep and insomnia, in breast cancer patients. The most critical component of the experience was patient interaction. As a research assistant, I was interacting with the patient from the beginning of the study during recruitment all the way through post-study visits and assessments. I particularly was drawn to building connections with each participant by learning her story. In doing so, I developed a greater understanding of the hardship that they experienced and its effect on their everyday life during the course of their cancer's progression and treatment., Lacrosse Camp Counselor and Assistant Director During two summers, I served as a camp counselor for three weeks of lacrosse camps at my high school alma mater. Responsibilities included running stations, leading drills, and mentoring a small group of kids throughout the week.  Spartan lacrosse is a camp started by my brothers and our friend occurring for one week during the past 3 winter breaks. As one of the camp directors I planned the weeklong schedule and managed counselors. Working so closely with 2nd -- 8th graders that attended my grade school, I felt a great sense of commitment towards not only sharing my passion for the game of lacrosse but also in building upon my school's heritage by developing younger generations., Intern at St. Laurent Realty, Inc. For two summers, I managed the properties of St. Laurent Realty, Inc., a real estate office that specializes in the leasing and management of office, industrial, commercial, flex and retail properties in Longwood, Florida. This task focused on the upkeep of properties and undertaking of projects that aimed to improve or refurbish existing company buildings or landscape. These jobs required a mental toughness and fortitude to carry out manual labor projects such as waterproofing a building amidst Florida's blistering heat and humidity.,  Lacrosse Coach, Scribe at Stanford's Emergency Department My main purpose is to help improve the emergency department's efficiency while improving patient care. As a scribe I document the patient's history, physical exam, tests, diagnoses, and recommended actions. This allows for the physician to better focus on the patient and also provides a more comprehensive patient record. This program requires undergoing extensive training in the classroom and shadowing physicians with the intent of learning proper medical documentation, medical terminology, and the electronic medical record system that Stanford Hospital uses. This knowledge is then translated to good use in an ever-bustling emergency department., Stanford Men's Lacrosse Playing lacrosse was an extensive commitment that shaped much of my undergraduate (and even stemming back to grade and high school) career. With year-round practices and workouts, lacrosse was always present in my life and served as a source for finding stability, friendship, and enjoyment. Although the summer and fall (offseason) schedules differed in focus, the commitment was as important and time-consuming with 2hr lifts or practices everyday while in-season additionally included 3hr game commitments. My role, even as a freshman, was geared around offensive leadership. This leadership transcended the offensive unit, when I became the Funding Officer Junior year and Captain Senior year.,  Research Assistant, Shadowing a Physician, Dr. Richard Goode Shadowing Dr. Goode, an ENT at Stanford, was a wonderful experience in understanding the intricacies of patient interaction and the general flow of the clinic and hospital. Aside from following patients through their entire process--initial visit to surgery to follow-up-- and given Dr. Goode's teaching background, we held weekly rounds in which I could ask about specific cases, treatments, and their outcomes. These rounds supplemented my observations in the hospital and clinic. We spent much of our time discussing treatment efficacies and the ethics involved with sharing treatment options and recommendations. This insight gave me a better understanding of the complex role a physician assumes, Homeless Breakfast at Palo Alto Opportunity Center Since sophomore year, I have helped organize, prepare, and serve breakfast once a month at the Palo Alto Opportunity Center. This experience has been one that allows me to bond with the others involved by collectively working towards a common goal, a delicious and nutritious breakfast. The immense pleasure and gratitude expressed by those receiving breakfast along with listening to their interesting stories has made this experience both humbling and truly enjoyable., Inter-Fraternity Council Recruitment Chair The inter-fraternity council is the collective governing board of fraternities on campus and mainly serves as a liaison between the fraternities and the university. My main role was disseminating information about fraternities and the Greek system at Stanford to interested students. As a recruitment chair, I took lead in coordinating Greek Rush and the events leading up to Rush. This included putting on information sessions to spark interest and answer questions from underclassmen, producing the Prospectus which shared general information about rush and specifics about each fraternity, organizing venues where fraternities could hold their events, and setting up and managing Rush., Coaching Youth Lacrosse Through ASPIRE lacrosse and the Menlo-Atherton's youth lacrosse club, I coached age groups 8-11 and 12-14 years old. Both programs sought to teach kids a set of fundamental skills from which their high school programs can build upon. Sessions were held on Fridays and Sundays. During this time I would lead the kids in demonstrations, drills, and games to hone in on the lesson of the week. My greatest joy was coming up with creative ways to teach each skill. These lessons included a perfect balance of teaching, repetition, and fun. Over a couple months time, watching the kids build a comfort with lacrosse and grow to love the sport was truly rewarding., Literature Review for Palesh Research Group Through my research experience I was given the opportunity to collaborate in writing a review article for the journal Nature and Science of Sleep about sleep in breast cancer patients during chemotherapy. My main role was performing a literature search of every study that aimed to alleviate sleep problems during treatment for breast cancer. My greatest contribution was creating a detailed table that assessed the specific details of each study and its findings. Being part of a project that involved many dedicated and renowned individuals in an up-and-coming field was a rewarding experience., Pacific Free Clinic - Front Desk and Lab Assistant Working at the front desk and as a lab assistant at Pacific Free Clinic has allowed me to further develop confidence and comfort in the clinical setting. Seeing mainly poor, uneducated, and uninsured patients has provided a stark contrast to the hospital setting. The most difficult aspect is being the bad guy and telling patients that due to time and personnel constraints we will not be able to address their needs. Fortunately, we are able to offer them other options where they can be treated. Also, for all the heart-wrenching deferrals, we are able to see and treat many more patients. As a lab assistant, I serve as a key coordinator between the patient, her blood draw, and its analyses., Research Assistant-Dr. DeCampli's Group Working for Dr. William DeCampli's lab was an awesome opportunity for hands-on research. During my sophomore summer, I was introduced to the field of pediatric cardiothoracic surgery with a study that looked at pharmacological means of decreasing brain damage during cardio-pulmonary bypass in fetal pigs. I took part in preparing the pig, the surgery station, the heart-lung machine, and managing the drug cabinet. During surgery I was monitoring vital signs and after surgery I aided with tissue extraction and wound closure. With surgeries occurring almost every Friday, I spent my time during the week checking supplies and reading background information."

    "text": "My mission in this personal statement is to tell you the story of why I want to be a doctor and how I can be certain, all in 5300 characters.  If only it were that simple.  To be honest, I have started seven essays with seven different reasons, all supported by specific details interwoven with personal experiences.  But here's the thing: there is no one story I can tell that can explain why I want to be a doctor.  I could tell you about how my father's heart attack when I was ten sparked my interest in preventative health.  I could tell you about how just about every woman in the history of my family has had breast cancer, and by conducting cancer research I could find a cure to save my grandmother, my mother, or even my own daughter in the future.  I could tell you about how I cried the first time I saw a baby move its fingers on an ultrasound while I was shadowing last year and how in that moment I could think of nothing more rewarding than working in a fertility clinic.  I could also go on, but I think you get the picture.    What I am trying to get at here is that there was no one moment that directed me towards medicine.  If that were the case, I might be worried that another epiphany would send me hurtling towards law school, or accounting, or teaching yoga in Nepal.  No, I want to be a doctor because every little thing along the way has lined up perfectly to suggest that a career in medicine would be the ideal choice for me.  People started telling me I should become a doctor when I was young, but that was at the same time that everyone else was being told to be a doctor (or an astronaut, or president of the United States...).  I didn't really buy into the suggestion.  As I got older though, I realized that I really do have the combined passion for science and love of humanity that I would want in my own doctor, and that I had unwittingly demonstrated interest all along.  In elementary school my teachers were horrified by my drawings of animal skeletons until they realized they were anatomically correct and copied from science books.  In middle school I was secretly overjoyed when the other members of my fish dissection group were all too squeamish to do anything and I got to take over.  In high school I used to sit in the athletic trainer's office at lunchtime so I could learn about all of the maladies my track team suffered from and how to prevent them in the future.    Now that I am in college, my experiences have become much more deliberate, and have taught me two main lessons about myself.  First, I have an intellectual curiosity and fascination with science that is in no way normal.  It didn't take me long to realize that a lot of science people are not actually particularly fond of the subject, and that genuine interest was something of a rarity.  I have often found myself enjoying assignments that some people saw as a chore.  I will never forget one Saturday morning last summer when I woke up early, and as I was lying in bed I realized that I was actually looking forward to the library opening so I could go and study for the MCAT.  My friends tease me about my weird love of biology facts, but when any of them have a question they come straight to me, knowing full well that if I don't have an answer for them, I will dutifully and enthusiastically pull out my laptop or textbook and will not be satisfied until I have found one.    The second thing I have discovered about myself is that I have a strong preference and need for human interactions.  I have learned so much as a research assistant but as I am processing data there is always a nagging voice in the back of my head asking, how does this apply  How can this data help someone Science alone cannot hold my interest like it can when applied to humanity; the same mass transfer calculation somehow became a hundred times more interesting to me when medicine diffused through a body versus a pollutant through soil.  The core of my interest in the medical sciences is the application to people rather than the science itself.  In the same way, I have come to realize that every service organization I have been involved with for an extended period of time is built upon interpersonal relationships as a foundation for any sort of service or communication.  Forming and maintaining real relationships with others makes me feel fulfilled and purposeful.   Medicine, at its best, is a balance of analytical skill and empathy, two qualities that align perfectly with my own strengths and interests.  Every day I become a little more convinced that becoming a doctor wasn't a childish dream and I truly do want to be one for the rest of my life.  I love that medicine is interpersonal and dynamic.  Already in my short life I have had so many opportunities and I have every reason to be thankful and give back.  I see medicine as a way to combine what I am good at with my desire to help others and make a difference.  If I were to be a doctor, I would love coming to work every day.  As far as a career goes, there is nothing else I could ever ask for. Delta Delta Delta Sorority As a member of Tri Delta I have had numerous opportunities, both in leadership and community service.  The biggest leadership opportunity I have had is my position as a Reflections leader, listed separately.  Community Service wise, our chapter has required philanthropic events every month which has exposed me to a lot of great people and organizations around Nashville., Dance Marathon Committee Member Dance Marathon is a student organization the raises money and awareness for the Children's Hospital here at Vanderbilt.  In the past I attended and volunteered at the event but last year I wanted to get more involved and joined the catering committee.  I was responsible for soliciting local restaurants to donate food for the main fundraising event., Girls On The Run Girls On The Run is an organization dedicated to empowering preteen girls by promoting confidence and a healthy lifestyle.  My role as a running buddy is to run the practice 5k's and races with a preteen partner.  This comes out to be about 8-10 hours/ semester.  I encourage her along the way and try to ensure that she beats her previous time.  My buddy is in 4th grade and already an amazing runner.  I love that I can share my knowledge with her and that I can see her running smarter and smarter races.  Even in 4th grade, she often talks about using running as a means to go to college.  I am amazed by her determination at such a young age, and hope to see great things from her in the future,, Research Paper I got involved with this paper through my work as a research assistant in the medical center. The paper was called Assessment of Wear/Nonwear Time Classification Algorithms for Triaxial Accelerometer and can be found on PubMed.  It was a very interesting and informative experience to see first hand all that is involved to write and publish a collaborative research paper., MPI Ecuador: Summer Internship I lived in Ecuador for a month and volunteered at Manna's community center.  I focused on women's exercise and nutrition as well as preventative health.  I also taught English classes and volunteered at a library.  It was an incredible experience to learn so much about Ecuadorian culture, improve my Spanish speaking abilities, and have some really thought provoking conversations about global citizenship.  It was also extremely interesting for me to learn about the medical system in Ecuador., Vanderbilt HPAO shadowing I shadowed Dr. Etoi Garrison, an Obstetrician-Gynecologist at Vanderbilt.  Dr. Garrison's specialty was high-risk obstetrics.  While shadowing, I saw a lot of ultrasounds and learned about what makes a pregnancy high risk.  When Dr. Garrison's office was slow I did rounds with the residents to get a feel for routine OB-GYN check-ups and procedures.  This experience was meaningful to me because I learned so much while I was there.  I had never had much of an interest in that field of medicine but the first time I sat in the ultrasound room and saw the baby moving inside its mother I got tears in my eyes and realized that I really could see myself doing that., MPI Guatemala: Spring Break Trip I spent my spring break in Rio Dulce, Guatemala with a small group of Vanderbilt Students.  We volunteered at an orphanage, painting the boys' house and playing with the children.  I had never been to South America before and it was an extremely eye opening experience.  I had never seen that kind of poverty before.  After returning from Guatemala I applied to return  to another Manna Site over the summer because I didn't feel like a week was long enough to really appreciate what life is like for most of the world., Research Assistant Lab Job I worked as a research assistant in the Energy Balance Laboratory of the Clinical Research Center.  I performed data analysis and worked with computer programming and modeling for energy expenditure and acceleromletry while learning about the clinical research process.  I worked at the EBL starting spring of my sophomore year, part time while in school and full time in the summers.   This year, I co-authored a paper that was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise.  The paper is called Assessment of Wear/Nonwear Time Classification Algorithms for Triaxial Accelerometer., National Merit Scholar , Refelections Peer Leader Reflections is an eating disorder prevention program sponsored by Delta Delta Delta.  As a Peer Leader, I attended an all day Reflections training session as well as some follow up training programs at the Vanderbilt Psychological Counseling Center.  After training I was in charge of leading the program and facilitating discussions within the Tridelta house, as well as being a contact person for anyone who needs resources in dealing with eating disorders and body image issues.  I look forward to orchestrating Fat Talk Free Week this fall.  I would estimate that I spent around 20 hours on Reflections related activities last semester, but never in a recurring weekly pattern.,  Research Assistant, Reformed University Fellowship RUF is a nondenominational church group at Vanderbilt.  Being a part of the organization has allowed me to meet some really amazing people, and going to services really helps me take a step back from my hectic life and reflect on what is important to me., Shadowing: Shade Tree Clinic Shade Tree is run but Vanderbilt Medical School students and is a free clinic for the Nashville Community, and last summer I got the chance to attend 4 sessions as an undergraduate observer.  I got to learn a lot about general medicine while I was there, as well as some of the frustrations the students faced such as language barriers and patients who did not show up for their appointments or remember to take their medicine.  I also really enjoyed the opportunity to talk to medical students and hear about their experiences.  I learned a lot about the reality of being in medical school., The LIFE Project Executive Board Member The LIFE Project is a student organization that pairs high school mentees with college mentors.  A big focus of the program is helping our mentees apply for college, but we also focus on other topical issues like relationships, self image, health, etc.  As a member of the executive board I was responsible for planning activities, pairing mentors with mentees, and balancing the budget.  When I got involved in LIFE Project it was going through a rebuilding/restructuring process and it has been really rewarding for me to sit on the board and make sure that the organization continues to grow and thrive next year., School of Engineering Mentor V-Squared is an organization in the School of Engineering that pairs freshmen with upper classmen in an attempt to ease their transition into Vanderbilt.  As a mentor, I had a group of 12 freshmen.  My responsibilities included contacting them during the summer and answering any questions they had before coming, giving them tours of campus and helping them find their classes upon arrival, and checking in from time to time throughout their freshman years to make sure everything was going smoothly.  I look forward to getting a new group of mentees in the coming weeks."

    "text": "One may wonder what a frozen chunk of spinal cord and viewing a laser-etched artwork have to do with wanting to become a surgeon, but in reality there is a relevant connection.  A few summers ago I worked at Cincinnati Children's Hospital as a laboratory aid in a developmental biology research lab.  I dissected mouse embryos, prepared solutions, and created microscope slides.  I also learned how professional research is done with millions of dollars of grant money on the line.  However, working with the Cryostat, slicing micron-thin cross sections of frozen embryonic mouse spinal cord, it became patently clear that although I appreciated what was at stake, I had a difficult time seeing the long-term implications of the research.  I fully appreciate that the art of doctoring does not always result in some instantaneous cure, but nevertheless there is an immediacy in a patient's human response that is a kind of instant gratification in contrast to a dead mouse's spinal cord just sitting there.  Fast-forward to a shadowing experience with a vascular surgeon.  One day following a post-operative checkup of an elderly patient, whose circulation to his feet had been restored, the patient's son presented the doctor with a piece of laser-etched artwork that he had crafted, depicting the doctor and his family doing one of their favorite pastimes: snow skiing.  The son, dissolving in tears, proceeded to tell the doctor how profoundly joyful he was that his father's feet would not have to be amputated and that he wanted the doc to have this token of his appreciation.  Following this incredibly touching demonstration of gratitude, the doctor ushered me into his office and explained that moments like the one I had just seen are what make being a physician worthwhile.  Until this moment, I had never truly witnessed the human side of medicine, and it further reinforced my desire to be a part of something this deeply meaningful.  In just this brief encounter, I felt emotionally invested in this guy's case, as though it were my father who had just been healed.  Though I am confident that my commitment, ethics and determination to succeed will lead me to become a good doctor, I believe that my compassion, sensitivity, interpersonal skills, and capacity to establish real connections with people can make me an even better clinician.    Business is my family's life and culture, and it could be mine too. But I have been dedicated to the idea of science and medicine for years, and it is not some fake notion to me.  I have actively engaged in diverse medical experiences that have confirmed that 'feeling' that I have always had about medicine. For example, spending a week at the University of Toledo Medical center dissecting human cadavers and practicing suturing techniques. I was immersed in the life of a medical student, spending hours in the gross anatomy lab and attending lectures alongside current medical students.  But I have also witnessed first-hand the less glamorous moments of medicine when I did rounds with doctors delivering dire news to terminally ill patients, or being in the room with a sickle cell patient as she writhed in pain.  I suffer no illusions about what the life of a physician is.  This is my ambition and passionately so.  I am confident in my academic prowess and depth of medical experience, but even more so in my experience with people.  I have worked as a cook, bus boy, golf instructor, babysitter and retail sales associate.  I am a teammate, brother, mentor and friend. In this time, I have encountered people from all walks of life. My capacity to relate easily and well to each and every one of them has provided me the background and knowledge to confront new and different challenges head on, and I feel this serves as the ideal foundation for a future career that is centered first and foremost, around people. University of Toledo College of Medicine's MedStarz After applying to the MedStarz program, I was one of 15 students selected to participate in the weeklong summer experience.  During this time, I lived on campus at the University of Toledo, and was given the opportunity to see what being a medical student is all about.  At the college of medicine, I spent hours in the gross anatomy lab dissecting human cadavers, and practicing different suturing techniques on pigs feet, while guided by actual surgeons. In addition, I sat in on clinical lectures alongside medical students, attended seminars about navigating the admissions process and spent a day going on rounds with an internist, gaining exposure to various conditions., International Medical Fraternity: Phi Delta Epsilon After going through a rigorous interview process during the first semester of my sophomore year, I was selected to join Miami University's only pre-medical fraternity. Through the small, tight-knit membership, I have been able to receive counsel on different classes to take, research opportunities, and guidance through the application process.  PhiDE has also enabled me to surround myself with like-minded people who all share a common goal. As a member of the recruitment committee for Phi Delta Epsilon, I am responsible for interviewing potential new members, new member education and contributing to the annual Phi Delta Epsilon banquet, which benefits Children's Miracle Network., Study Abroad: Florence, Italy Classes included Italian Film Studies, European Renaissance Literature, and Art History. Our days were spent visiting various art museums, learning about the Italian culture, and reading books by Renaissance authors such as Boccaccio, Petrarch and Machiavelli.  I also had the opportunity to travel on weekends and explore other countries including: Switzerland, Croatia and Germany., Employee: Abercrombie & Fitch During the first part of the summer of 2011, I worked as a sales associate at the children's Abercrombie store.  My responsibilities included working the cash register, helping customers find desired products on the floor, and re-stocking the back storage room.  Approximately six weeks into summer, I left for Italy to study abroad, explaining why I only worked at Abercrombie during the beginning of the summer., Physician Shadowing: Gastroenterology I had the opportunity to observe Dr. Geisler perform a colonoscopy on a patient who had previously had a portion of his colon re-sectioned. Following the procedure, I spent some with Dr. Geisler in his office discussing what I had just seen, and his specialty in general. He pulled out some cutting edge tools that he uses to excise portions of the colon, and described them to me as if he were a kid telling their friend about a favorite toy. I felt privileged to hear first hand about the future and technology of non-invasive colorectal surgery and it was fascinating to learn exactly how some of these surgical tools work from a person whose job relies on them every day., Academic Recognition: Deans List I have made the Dean's List during each semester of my enrollment at Miami University. (GPA 3.5-3.9), Miami University Research Lab Assistant I signed on to Dr. Berg's research team during the first semester of my Junior year, and worked with the specific goal of figuring out how people's nervous systems anticipate and react to unknown stimuli.  We attempted to study relative timing and coordination of muscle activity and postural control through the use of projectiles and surface electromyography. My responsibilities included: placing electrodes at various locations throughout the body, data analysis using software linked to the electrodes, and subject processing throughout the duration of the experiment., Cincinnati Children's Hospital Summer Research I worked as a laboratory assistant three days per week throughout the summer in Dr. Yutaka Yoshida's developmental biology lab, focused on the molecular mechanisms of neural circuit formation in the developing spinal cord.  More specifically, how mutations in certain genes impact afferent and efferent synapses in the dorsal and ventral horns. Some of my responsibilities included preparing solutions for in situ hybridization, creating microscope slides using a cryostat from frozen blocks of nervous tissue, and dissecting embryonic mice for removal of their dorsal root ganglia and DNA analysis., Physician Shadowing: Cardiology Most of my time with Dr. Schneider was spent in the cardiac cath-lab watching him perform angiographies and inserting stents into patient's coronary arteries. On one occasion, a patient was air-lifted into the hospital mid-heart attack, and Dr. Schneider was able to restore blood flow, potentially saving the patient's life. Each catheterization required a slight tweak in his approach, to fit the wire to the unique vascularization of the patient. Watching Dr. Schneider bend and contort the tip of the wire as he inserted it into the femoral artery, I saw just how unique each case can be, keeping the doctor on his toes at all times and providing an exciting experience for me as well., Physician Shadowing: Internal Medicine My day making rounds with Dr. Feng and a med student at University of Toledo College of Medicine was so unique because of the diversity of patients and different conditions that we encountered.  In one room, we checked in on someone recovering from open heart surgery, and in the next room, a woman who was suffering from sickle cell anemia.  I had never realized the kind of agonizing pain the disease causes, and it was quite difficult to simply stand there seeing her writhing in pain.  Perhaps the most intriguing part of the day was how Dr. Feng constantly adjusted his bedside manner to fit the mood of the room he was about to enter and to the unique needs of each one of his patients., Golf My favorite hobby and greatest release from studying has always been the game of golf.  I was co-captain of my high school golf team and I continue to play at every chance I get. Golf has not only been a fun pastime, but it has also provided me the opportunity to connect and relate with countless people through a shared interest. In addition, I spent the summer of 2009 coaching a local student for his 7th grade golf tryouts. On most days I would either help him with his swing at the driving range or play a round of golf with him, teaching him game management.  At the end of the summer I received the great news that he had made his golf team., Physician Shadowing: Vascular Surgery My time with Dr. Mesh began in the operating room where I got to watch surgeries including an invasive aortic aneurysm repair, multiple catheterizations, and peripheral artery bypasses. Perhaps more enjoyable than watching these surgeries, was the time I spent in the office with him and his patients. I was amazed by the way patients would open up, simply because they felt so comfortable with him. It was also extremely exciting for me to hear a set of symptoms, and wonder what could be the root cause of the ailment. My time with Dr. Mesh struck an incredible balance between surgical observation and patient interaction, and it is this diversity of experience that made it so meaningful., Cincinnati Freestore Foodbank Volunteer One of my most important tasks was assembling packages for the 'Power Pack' program.  This program provides kid-friendly foods for children to take home with them after school on Friday afternoons, and ensures they have something to eat over the weekend. Service at the Freestore Foodbank started as an activity that I participated in with my family, and it will continue as I maintain my involvement in hunger-related volunteer work. In addition, during the holidays, my family and I volunteer at the soup kitchen serving meals to hundreds of hungry families., Volunteer: People Working Cooperatively PWC weekend service involved doing various yard-work, painting fences and helping elderly/disabled people with miscellaneous household chores.  On an average day, 3-4 hours were spent cleaning up at least 5 different houses around the Oxford area., Phi Delta Theta Fraternity This past semester I served as the community service chairman of Phi Delta Theta, which involved planning philanthropies to benefit ALS, and ensuring that all brothers participated in at least 10 hours of community service. Volunteer work included: cleaning the 'Adopt-a-highway' stretch of road named for the fraternity, holiday gift drives, and various other service endeavors.  I have served on the chapter judiciary board, which is tasked with making sure all brothers act in accordance with not only university regulations, but the chapter bylaws as well.  I am also an active member of the recruitment committee, and I compete on our basketball, flag-football, and soccer intramural teams."

    "text": "After backpacking above the clouds on the Kepler Track, running down the mountainside of Ben Lomond, and climbing a volcano in a rainstorm, the last way I expected to end my study abroad experience in New Zealand was in the hospital.I was admitted after suffering sudden, severe abdominal pain. That night a doctor told me I needed immediate emergency surgery and explained the risks associated with the procedure. Surrounded by unfamiliar faces and contemplating the possibility of death on the operating table, I never felt further from home or more alone in my life. Then, Dr. Millar entered the room. He sat on the bed, took my hand, and told me that he was going to operate. In a soft, calm voice he informed me of his decade of experience and reasons for the procedure's necessity, assuring me that I would be alright. I believed him and will always remember how much calmer he made me feel. After surgery and two and a half weeks of recovery in the hospital, I was discharged. Dr. Millar visited during his rounds every day. Always kind and reassuring, he sincerely tried to connect with me as a patient and was resoundingly successful in that respect. He demonstrated firsthand what a difference a doctor can make on a patient's life. A doctor has an obligation to help patients which encompasses not only physical healing but also emotional healing through the formation of a human connection. This experience taught me that I want to help people in the same way Dr. Millar helped me, and it provided me with empathy which I hope will contribute to this goal.   \tAlthough this hospital experience was inspiring, I made the decision to become a doctor long before traveling to New Zealand. I considered the career ever since I was a child. I remember actually looking forward to doctor's check ups- except for shots, of course. I enjoyed the doctor's friendly questions because he made me feel important by taking the time to listen to my answers. In second grade, another experience contributed to my drive to become a doctor when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. As a child, I did not truly understand what cancer was or the possible dire ramifications of the diagnosis. I simply assumed that it was an illness and that her doctor would fix her, just as my doctor always fixed me when I was sick. Luckily, she recovered after the mastectomy, and her doctor proclaimed her to have no evidence of disease. The first month of my freshman year at college, a metastasis was found in her spine. By this time, I possessed a much greater understanding of illness than my second grade self. I knew the dangers of metastasis and was afraid in a way which I had not been before. Thankfully, my mom is currently on medication which has slowed tumor growth. I am deeply grateful to my moms doctors for giving me more time with her. My moms illness is part of the reason why I chose to become a doctor; I want to be able to help people as she was helped, to be able to save lives and give people more time with their loved ones.  \tAdditionally, my budding interest in medicine guided my academic pursuits. As a high school student, I took as many advanced science courses as I could, which strengthened my conviction to become a physician.  However, experiences as an undergraduate truly solidified my career choice. In the summer following my sophomore year, I shadowed at the East Tennessee Children's Hospital with Dr. Lori Patterson. Following her throughout her daily routine as she visited with patients, I met several children but remember one girl in particular. She was an eight-year-old with an ear infection who told me all about the fish she caught single-handedly the previous weekend; she even showed me a picture of her proudly holding the fish and grinning ear-to-ear. My experience with her showed me that forming a human connection with a patient is not only beneficial; it can also be fun. While talking with her, I knew that I was doing something I truly enjoyed and that I wanted to continue to meet and help other brave patients like her. Almost two years following this experience, I still feel the same way. I know I want to become a physician, and my life experiences have solidified that aspiration. Hopefully, one day I will be able to give my patients what I was given as a patient in a hospital very far from home - that all-important human connection. Scientific Publication During my time working in a chemical engineering lab, I discovered that lab work lacked the social interaction I crave in a work environment. Despite my personal feelings about the job, I continued to arrive on time for work and to diligently mix media, pour plates, and count lipid droplets. I also maintained a positive attitude while at work. In short, I put my best effort into the job even when I found the work to be somewhat repetitive. Having my work published is proof of that. It showed me that applying myself to a task, even one I do not enjoy, can lead to success. Additionally, I appreciate knowing that my hours of work contributed to the scientific community., Honors Thesis Project During the spring semester of senior year, I designed and completed my senior thesis project. Rather than working in a lab, I used my thesis project as an opportunity to educate myself on a personally relevant topic. My thesis, entitled “A Literature Review of Risk Factors for the Development of Breast Cancer: Risks and Prevention Methods,” was essentially a compilation of information from 87 scientific papers regarding established breast cancer risk factors and their associated physiological mechanisms. Completing this project required application of knowledge gained from science classes. Ultimately, my thesis was rewarding because it taught me about my mother’s disease.,  Food Service, Summa Cum Laude For as long as I can remember, I have had perfectionist tendencies. From tree climbing as high as possible as a child to fine-tuning the ultimate chocolate chip cookie recipe as a teenager, I have always sought perfection in every activity. This quality has also pushed me to do the best I possibly can in school. I worked my way through high school with straight A’s, and I was determined to do the same thing in college. I tried to focus on academics in my freshman and sophomore year of college by limiting my extracurriculars, and I dedicated myself to doing the best I possibly could in my classes. Graduating summa cum laude with a 4.0 is proof of my efforts and of my drive for perfection., Phi Beta Kappa I first heard about Phi Beta Kappa during freshman year as an undergraduate. When reading about my honors general chemistry professor, I noticed that he was the Chapter President of Phi Beta Kappa. I asked a friend about the organization and was told that it was the oldest national academic honorary society. I decided that gaining acceptance to Phi Beta Kappa would be a personal goal for me, an indicator of academic success. With this goal in mind, I put my best effort into every class I took. After the end of junior year, I finally received and accepted an invitation to join Phi Beta Kappa. My induction felt as though all my hard work was validated., Shadowing under Dr. Patterson I shadowed Dr. Lori Patterson at the East Tennessee Children's Hospital. Unfortunately, her irregular and perpetually busy schedule prevented me from shadowing her more frequently., Private Tutor - Organic Chemistry I was a private tutor for Lindsay in organic chemistry at the undergraduate level. At our sessions, I explained the basics of organic chemistry as well as specific topics that she had difficulty with in class. Although explaining difficult concepts could be frustrating at times, I always kept in mind how challenging it can be to immediately grasp new complex ideas. This helped me be patient in my explanations and try new teaching methods where others failed. Ultimately, my favorite part of the teaching process was helping her comprehend a specific challenging topic for the first time. On these occasions, I truly succeeded as a teacher., Chancellor's Honors Program I was selected for the Chancellor’s Honors Program based on my academic achievements in high school. As part of this program, I completed a thesis project as well as several honors classes. Much to my surprise, many of my favorite courses throughout college happened to be my most challenging honors courses, like honors organic chemistry. Although I originally took such classes to satisfy requirements, I found them to be formative to my college experience beyond simply honing my study skills. I discovered I enjoy the deeper discussion of information and challenging presentation of material that ultimately leads to a fuller understanding of the subject., Undergraduate Research I worked part time in a chemical engineering lab on two research projects: one on lipid droplet formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and another project in development of drug delivery vehicles. Although I gained valuable research experience, after a few weeks of lab work I realized research was not an area I wanted to pursue. The vast majority of my job was spent doing solitary tasks, such as making media or counting lipid droplets. My favorite part of lab work was interacting with others in the lab, which I did not have the opportunity to do as often as I wished. Overall, this experience taught me that any job I truly enjoyed would involve working with others., C.W. Keenan Outstanding General Chemistry Student Award My academic efforts which earned me the highest grade in my honors general chemistry class were unexpectedly rewarded with the C. W. Keenan Award. The class was my most difficult of freshman year, with “challenge problems” that lived up to their name and exams that required critical application of knowledge rather than simple memorization. Although at first I found such challenges intimidating, I resolved to throw myself wholeheartedly into my work. I reviewed material after each lecture and prepared painstakingly for each exam. Earning this award taught me that I thrive in challenging environments and that true dedication and application to studies is the surest route to academic success., Nourish International Nourish is a student-led organization which raises funds to fight global poverty in a sustainable way. The club accomplishes this by sending students to poverty-stricken areas where they engage in projects to revitalize the local economy.,  Undergraduate Research, Clinic Vols When I first joined this organization, I received American Red Cross first aid training as a prerequisite to volunteering. Throughout the fall semester of my junior year, I volunteered every Monday in a local elementary school clinic. I could not participate in the following spring semester because I was studying abroad. However, my experience in Clinic Vols later enriched both semesters of my senior year."

    "text": "The room was dark with the shades drawn to block out the bright Texas sun. As we stepped into the room that reeked of alcohol hand sanitizer, I could see Logan lying listlessly under the plain white sheets of the plain white bed. On the chart, it said he was in his mid-teens. In person, he looked so frail and small that I barely believed he was a teenager at all.   Dr. Shelly, a pediatric oncologist I had been shadowing that morning at Children's Medical Center, introduced me before taking Logan's vital signs. Logan, quiet with dark bags under his eyes, laid still, waiting for us to leave so he could continue recovering from his chemo. But Dr. Shelly did not believe in passive healing--she believed healing started from human contact. She palpated his pulse as she asked about his guitar and if he got a hang of that chord from the song on his iPod. Logan replied he nailed that chord, and began to prop himself up on his pillows. He said he could play the entire song now, and rattled off the other Garth Brooks songs he wanted to learn. She asked him to hum it. I tried to help, but Logan and I were both terrible hummers. As we left, Dr. Shelly promised to brush up on her Garth Brooks while Logan began to look like the teenager he was supposed to be as he continued humming with a crooked smile. In that moment, Dr. Shelly showed me how a doctor can provide her patients with comfort during such dark times.   I met Dr. Shelly and Logan during my week at Children's, where I split my time between shadowing physicians and volunteering in playrooms. Before this, I never had the opportunity to see so many aspects of medicine in such depth. During a chaotic morning at Children's, I met Bang, a rambunctious six-year-old who did not believe in broken bones but believed that volunteers were able-bodied jungle gyms. After learning how to wrap Bang's broken arm while he climbed mine, I found a quiet moment as I crossed the skywalk. I wondered if I could be a doctor, spend all my time in a hospital, and deal with every aspect of this world. I noted no matter how tired I was from the day before, I always looked forward to returning. I knew that meant packed days and complicated circumstances, but the prospect of witnessing some new, exciting case while connecting to a new patient made the stress worthwhile. During that franticness, I understood my passion for medicine could withstand the somber aspects of the job and that I am ready to mold my life in way that will allow me to achieve my goal of becoming a doctor.    No path in medicine is easy, especially not the path to being a physician. I have learned being a doctor demands time and effort to get results. To be a good doctor, you must be dedicated to always developing your knowledge, something I learned while shadowing Dr. Langone at the Vanderbilt. Before meeting Dr. Langone, my perspective of the medical world was from the view of an outsider, so the first few rounds of shadowing were petrifying. My head swam from the cascade of jargon bouncing among the bustling doctors, residents, and nurses, and I was afraid any motion might disturb this chaotic stream of efficiency. Despite my apprehension, I wanted to be an insider, to not only understand but to actively contribute to the conversation. I carefully noted the techniques Dr. Langone showed his residents, brushed up on the latest literature, and by the end of our year together, I could conduct background interviews for kidney transplant patients and be useful for the team. Dr. Langone showed me that I had the potential to grow and instilled in me the confidence to continue forth in medicine.  Working with Dr. Langone allowed me to gain a better perspective of the different layers of medicine. Although nurses, physician's assistants, and care partners all provide critical care for the patient, I believe that the physician has the greatest freedom in making the choices that will bring the best results for the patient. This freedom allows for innovation and willingness to go beyond conventions to provide more effective care for both patient and society. I want to be at the forefront of development so that I can use the influence and experiences of being a doctor to help develop improved modes of healthcare.  When I reflect upon my experiences so far, I am always amazed by the visible impact that a physician has on his patients. When I think back to Logan or the kidney transplant patients of Dr. Langone, I remember their renewed enjoyment of life. Because of the efforts of their physicians, they could return to being teenagers and travel without worrying about dialysis. To me, a doctor provides the bridge back to normal life. I think for many patients it is easy to forget that they are more than their disease and that they can return to being who they were before when they leave the hospital. As a doctor, I want to connect to patients so I can help reconnect them to the lives they want to lead, and I want to apply the knowledge that medical school provides so that I can fight for my patients. I intend to go medical school because I believe that the rigors of training will challenge me to be bold and resourceful and provide the stepping stones I need to become the compassionate and proactive doctor I hope to be Burn Unit Volunteer Sometimes you just watch TV with them. I did not understand Jack, the head volunteer, when he first said this. I realize now he meant that even small gestures can offer an inexplicitly profound comfort to someone in a hospital. As a Burn volunteer, my duties are centered on making the patients and their families comfortable whether that means finding lodging or fetching blankets. I pay individual visits to the patients in the unit. Some days I end up discussing life, dogs, or divorces for hours. Other days, I help with stocking supplies, food deliveries, and other miscellaneous tasks. Regardless, the best part of any day is when a patient asks you to visit again., Undergraduate Researcher (Circadian Rhythms) Although I had done some summer research during high school, I had never researched as a college student until I joined Dr. Carl Johnson's lab. I was paired with a postdoc from a collaborating lab so that I could help her analyze the potential correlations between polymorphisms in circadian genes and psychological disorders or premature births. I participated in both the dry bench--computer analysis of the diagnosis of patients--and wet bench-- gel electrophoresis to ascertain genotypes of patients--aspects of the project., Front Desk Assistant Although Vandebilt University may not have the largest campus, it is one confusing mesh of overlapping mini-campuses. As a Front Desk Assistant, I help navigate visitors, students, and other guests through all of our different schools. Depending on how busy campus is, I also assist the Office of Housing and Resident Advisors by organizing communal equipment, helping with resident lockouts, and keeping track of the dorm maintenance., Undergraduate Researcher (Cancer Biology) During high school, I researched in a breast cancer laboratory and enjoyed the translational nature of the research. I joined Dr. Pao's lab because I wanted to return to this type of research. My first project was to characterize the mechanism of  resistance in novel lung cancer cells. I consulted with a postdoc about techniques, but the majority of the project was conducted independently. My current project is to test the efficacy of a novel lung cancer drug on several well-known mutations within lung cancer. Currently, I am culturing two well-known cell lines, transfecting in the specified mutations, and characterizing their responses to the drug., Student Shadow and Volunteer, Children's Hospital (Dallas) Movies portray college spring breaks as beaches and chaos, but Vanderbilt believes spring break should be service and chaos. I chose a site that would allow me to have an immersive hospital experience because I wanted to see what it is like to spend an entire day working in a hospital. Each day was intense, and we participated in many different activities. During the day, we shadowed and worked in playrooms at Children's Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. At night, we helped cook dinner for the local Ronald McDonald house. Even with all that, our group still found time in the late, late night to gather and tell our life stories so we could appreciate our differences., Vanderbilt Undergraduate Chinese Association My adventures with VUCA began when Cindy Lin, the president of VUCA during my freshman year, knocked on my door on the first day of classes and handed me a cookie with an invitation to come to the first general body meeting. For a bewildered freshman, the small gesture represented the hope that somewhere in this huge campus someone was willing to look out for me. Since that first cookie, I've attended almost every VUCA event such as the annual Dumpling Making Party, helped organize the holiday events, and even dared to brave the stage as a dancer during our annual Lunar Festival Celebration. Perhaps my favorite thing, though, is baking those lovely beginning of the year cookies., Vanderbilt University Radio Station On a lazy Sunday, my freshman roommate and I attended WRVU's information session and signed up to be DJs. I have always enjoyed music, and sharing my music with others audiophiles seemed like a logical thing to do. However, my experience evolved into so much more. I have hosted my own show and been a part of the Executive Staff every year of my college career. To help the station deal with the vast numbers of music submissions, I created the new record system as Music Director, and helped write a new manual for DJ equipment as Office Manager. Although I must leave soon, I will always look for the WRVU stream, and I am excited to see how my station will evolve with the years., Vanderbilt Emergency Medicine Society There is nothing like getting your hands dirty to really learn something, and there is no better place to get your hands dirty in the field of medicine than in emergency medicine. I applied to be in VEMS Emergency Medicine First Responder course in order to become EM-FR certified. What started as just a standard lecture course evolved into weekly practicals with challenging scenarios that not only tested our skills of CPR or stretcher lifting but also tested our abilities to be decisive in a time of crisis. Since completing the course, I have become EM-FR certified and plan to volunteer for a local free healthcare clinic during the school year., Vanderbilt Students for Science (Team Leader) There is nothing quite like coordinating the flight of 30 wood airplanes made by 30 middle school students. I would summarize it as exciting chaos. I started in VSVS as a Team Member my freshman year, and as I grew more confident in my teaching skills, I advanced to a Team Leader. Each semester, my team and I would pay a weekly visit to a middle or elementary school class in the Nashville Metro system to teach a variety of science-related lessons ranging from simple physics lessons to creating fake snow. As Team Leader, I helped develop and streamline lesson plans and trained team members. Some days the Team Leader is also responsible for being pelted with paper planes., Shadowing (Nephrology) When I told Dr. Langone that I wanted to be a doctor, he just smiled and replied, Come to rounds. We start at 8. I showed up expecting to watch and take notes, but Dr. Langone believes that observing without actually doing does not result in learning. With Dr. Langone, I not only learned the background knowledge about kidney transplants like what creatine levels hinted at renal failure , but I also learned physical skills like how to check for an enlarged liver by scratching the patient's stomach while listening with a stethoscope. Towards the end our time together, I could conduct background interviews that help determine eligibility for potential transplant patients."

    "text": "Phones cradled to each ear, I gave a silent nod to my colleagues as they headed home for the night. The phone rang again and I could immediately sense the caller's urgency. Through his tears, a young man named Z gave his abridged life story. He had overcome a negligent and sexually abusive upbringing to attend college and secure a spot as a semi-professional athlete, but was short on rent again and in danger of losing all that he had worked for. After trying so hard only to fail repeatedly, Z could not envision doing it again. Z explained that he was planning to step in front of a car. I suddenly heard the roar of traffic and my stomach sank. What's the point he pleaded.   At Z's age I would have had trouble answering his question. Term after term of my early undergraduate career, I would fail to organize my life, only able to send home more bad news to my father as he battled prostate cancer. In obvious need of a break from my studies, I fell back on skills gained from a lifetime of tinkering with computers. A few short months as a computer repair technician quickly instilled in me the value of a college education. Improved grades upon my return to a community college paid off in the form of readmission to UCSB, where I reveled in the intellectual rigors of statistics and the fascinating field of biochemistry. My past life as a poor student had been unpalatable in countless ways, but the feeling of scraping by without ever truly understanding course material left the worst aftertaste. I resolved to never walk that path again and immediately became the student that I had always wanted to be. I found errors in statistics textbooks, tackled problem sets with graduate students, and earned the respect of my peers in biochemistry lab.   A tenuous grasp on persistent sleep issues would soon spell another blemish on my transcript, however. My first comeback had been a difficult hike. I knew that I wanted to do it, but had no idea how rough or long it would be, so I endured. I could relate to Z's despondency that night, however, as he fell back to the foot of the mountain. While I proved myself tenacious, it would be years before I possessed Z's courage and wisdom to ask for help so that I could finally find relief in the form of a sleep apnea diagnosis.  I soon recovered from that final sleepy stumble, however, and began undergraduate biochemical research. I knew that I had found something special when entire days spent in the lab felt like minutes, so I prepared to pursue graduate studies in the field. As I took inventory of my interests, however, I realized that biochemistry alone did not fully encompass what I hoped to derive from a career. To my surprise, a desire for face-to-face contact with the people who might benefit from my work compelled me to finally explore the profession that I had watched my grandfather devote his life to.   I wrapped up my research and left Santa Barbara to find a volunteer position at an emergency department. My shift in the ED quickly became my favorite part of the week as I was embraced as a small part of the team. The sheer amount of human contact in a hospital was invigorating, but it was the work of the physicians there that sold me on medicine. I initially saw their role as the embodiment of my aforementioned mantra to understand everything, but my admiration grew as I realized that it is the ability to make decisions without the security of a complete understanding that underlies the art of medicine. Our understanding is most evidently incomplete with regard to the social issues that play into much of what a physician encounters. Disturbingly frequent amongst these issues was the problem of suicide. I wanted to understand suicide and make my own dent in the problem, so I applied to volunteer at my county's crisis center.  I tend to gravitate toward difficult pursuits and the Crisis Center was no exception. Only once in my life have I ever considered running out of a room and never coming back, and it was prior to my first mock suicide call in front of a group of over 30 people during training. I progressed quickly as my comfort zone expanded, however, and was soon hired as staff. While my communication skills improved immensely, it has been the privilege of countless invitations into the private realities of others and the subsequent effect on my worldview that I value most. Whether it was an encouraging conversation with a professor or the final discussion with a physician as a nurse removed my grandfather's oxygen mask, I know that words can mean the world to a vulnerable individual. Desperate callers will repeatedly play back and dissect my words, so I measure them carefully.   As Z stood at the edge of the road, I wracked my brain to try and help him. During a lull in traffic, I convinced him to step back and give me one chance. Through tears, he asked again, what's the point of staying alive I explained to Z that someday his life would be filled with people who love and respect the person forged by his struggles. I went on to promise him that someday he would have something in his life that he will be glad to have lived to experience. For Z, that thing may be a professional sport or something he has yet to find. For me, it will be medicine. Emergency Department / Trauma Center Volunteer •1092 total hrs. 8 hrs/week through 7/11, then 4 hrs q2w. Conflict with class schedule 1/12--5/12. Currently 4 hrs q2w.  •I restock supplies and answer call lights for over 40 rooms.  •I carry a phone that is listed on the boards throughout the department, so that staff can always reach me.   •Patient transport, intake, and discharge via wheelchair. •I provide comfort to worried or confused patients as a sitter and watch toddlers while their parent is in imaging. •Delivery and pickup of lab samples, paperwork, blood, medications, meals, equipment, etc. •Increase patient turnover by cleaning rooms, moving gurneys, preparing the trauma bays, etc., Crisis and Suicide Hotline Staff Specialist •1-3 days/wk •Advancement to a staff position expanded my duties to include supervision and coaching of up to 5 volunteers as they answer and document calls. I am consistently able to ensure that my team effectively and compassionately meets the needs of our clients and answers every call that comes in to our lines.  •As part of a pilot program with Columbia University, I make follow-up calls to clients previously determined to be at medium or high lethality in order to assess for safety and to encourage the creation of and compliance with a safety plan. •I also work solo overnight shifts during which I must triage callers from this unique demographic based on suicidality., Concert / Event Medical Staff, CPR Certified •150 hours. 17 concerts and events attended.  •Rock Med provides free medical care at concerts and other large events. Physicians, PAs, NPs, other healthcare providers, and the CPR certified serve as volunteers. At some events, I join or lead a group primarily comprised of EMTs and Paramedics as we respond to emergencies throughout the venue. At others, I remain in the hospital and perform intakes on patients, take vitals, relay information to clinicians, comfort and supervise the intoxicated, and supply concert goers with earplugs, sunscreen, and OTC medication. I recently worked as lead for the first time at a concert, coordinating the activities of the entire group., Orthopedics Floor Volunteer •330 hrs total. 3 hrs/week through 6/11, then 3 hrs q2w until course conflict.  •In contrast to the environment of the ED, orthopedics provided a look at inpatient medicine. Sometimes, I would see a patient dodge death as a trauma and subsequently get to know them personally during their extended recovery. I would help coordinate patient flow with surgery, create discharge packets for recovery facilities, and distribute physician orders, medications, and equipment to nurses. I also frequently checked rooms for supplies and helped set up for procedures. I helped the floor with its move to a new building, which provided insight into modern hospital design., Dean's Honors •Fall 2005 •Winter 2006 •Spring 2008, Shadowed Robert Rovner, M.D. •One day, 10 hours. •I spent a day shadowing Dr. Rovner, an orthopedic spine surgeon. He made rounds, saw follow-up patients in his office, had lunch with an orthopedic sales representative, performed two surgeries, and dictated. I was also able to observe and discuss the work of several anesthesiologists present during the surgeries.  I intend to take advantage of the many available shadowing opportunities at the University of Cincinnati in the coming months to further my understanding of the profession., Volunteer Crisis and Suicide Hotline Worker At JMMC, I witnessed the aftermath of many suicide attempts and grieved with staff after the suicide of one of our physicians. The effects of this problem have a far greater reach than most of the public is aware and even many medical professionals struggle to comprehend suicide. At the CCCC, I am able to assist and learn from those who are contemplating suicide. I am trusted with the deepest thoughts and feelings of people from all walks of life. My speaking, listening, and cultural competency skills have increased tremendously as I have strived to better serve our diverse region. This experience has transformed my view of the world and everyone that I encounter within it., Hobbies Cooking I still have dog-eared copies of my childhood cookbooks that I have cooked through many times and still look forward to preparing an elaborate meal for friends and family. While my skills and knowledge have improved over the past two decades, so too has my ability to recover from unplanned events and work with a group.   Dining I like to experience and learn from the work of professional chefs and also to understand how other cultures eat. I research restaurants across the world to add to a lengthy list that serves me well in my travels.    Winemaking since 2007 Most recently, our group bottled our 2012 80% Cab. / 20% Zin. blend.

    "text": "Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending - Maria Robinson. I am not a traditional undergraduate student, but I believe that the life experiences I have had more than make up for the time lost in another career. One of the most difficult things I have done in my life was quitting my job at Deloitte Consulting; many people close to me told me I was making the biggest mistake of my life. At the end of the day, however, only you know what will make you happy.  I graduated from Miami University in 2009 with degrees in marketing and music. I considered teaching music as a career, as I enjoyed teaching private flute lessons and tutoring in subjects such as music theory and algebra. As graduation neared, however, my path led me in the direction of the business world, and I accepted a job offer with Deloitte Consulting, an offer I did not take lightly. Many students were openly jealous of the position I'd been offered - yes, I would be the lucky 22-year-old wearing a suit every day, traveling the world, working 80+ hours each week, and helping companies make important decisions - but I knew deep down that it would not be a job I would hold upon retirement. I have always had many interests and talents, and have been told from a very young age what I should do with my life. When you are bombarded with statements like these at a relatively young age, it can be difficult to think for yourself and discover what truly interests you and will make a meaningful career.   I left my job at Deloitte in December of 2011 for two reasons. First, I learned that the business world wasn't for me. While I enjoyed many aspects of my job - communicating with CEOs, directors, and surgeons; developing complicated analytical models; the challenge and excitement of learning something new every day - I didn't feel that I could sleep at night with the knowledge that I was truly helping anyone. Second, I spent most of my time at Deloitte in healthcare, working in hospitals with nurse managers, surgeons, and other healthcare professionals. I found myself longing to be on the other side of things: working directly with patients and working in medicine. I often scrubbed in, exchanging my suit for scrubs in order to observe different surgical processes in hospitals and help clients make these processes more efficient. These experiences offered me a greater understanding of the daily activities performed by doctors and nurses and truly sparked my interest. I knew this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  Throughout my life, I have been fortunate enough to have many valuable, life-changing experiences. I studied abroad in Dijon, France during the summer of 2006, an experience that truly took me out of my comfort zone. Although proficient in writing French, I quickly discovered that speaking and understanding French outside of the classroom was quite difficult. I was able to overcome this barrier with time, the help of a French conversation class, and the other American students who traveled with me. I learned how to rely on others while also gaining independence and confidence. My time in France taught me to be flexible, persistent, and culturally aware.  In May I ran a half-marathon, an experience that meant finding a balance among many time commitments and that taught me to push myself. As a runner, I have learned that not everything is a competition. While I'm running, it's just me and my shoes - it's all about pushing myself to be better than I was yesterday.   In 2012, I accepted a job as a veterinary assistant, or pet nurse. I was responsible for obtaining pulse rates, body temperature readings, and respiration rates, administering vaccines, and educating clients about pet health. I enjoyed the clinical aspects of the position, but found the interactions I had with pets' owners to be perhaps the most rewarding part of the job. Being able to inform a client that his/her dog was healthy meant a lot to me, but the more unusual occasions truly made the job something I loved doing every day. On one such occasion, I walked into a room where a mother and daughter sat anxiously twitching and casting nervous glances. Upon speaking with the mother, I learned that their guinea pig was not eating or drinking, a fact that truly brought distress to her daughter. In the end, the veterinarian on the team decided the best course of action was to put the pet down, so I was sent in to deliver the news. I hugged the daughter, and her mother tearfully thanked me for my compassion, telling me that her daughter's grandmother had passed away not a week earlier. While I do not envy the clients for the very difficult week they had been put through, I am thankful that I was able to bring a morsel of comfort to their lives.   The combination of my ambition, intelligence, work ethic, and interest in medicine have convinced me that my real path in life is to be a physician. I believe my experiences have led me to where I want to be and have helped shape who I am. I am a more mature, well-rounded person now than I would have been had I started college as a pre-medical student, and I am confident I will be able to put the skills I have acquired to good use in the medical field.  Administrative Assistance, Consultant (Strategy & Operations) at Deloitte Consulting As a consultant, I advised clients on strategic and operational challenges, focusing on Performance Improvement as part of the Health Care Providers specialty. I performed financial/market analysis to develop recommendations and produce actionable deliverables for clients. I was a member of several teams that worked for $2B Health Systems, where I advised clients on leading practices for surgical services operations, built analytical models to track metrics and provide recommendations, led clients meetings, conducted benchmarking analysis, and tracked and consolidated deliverables. I also worked with federal and real estate clients, working daily with CEOs and CFOs., Diagnostic Testing Services Center Volunteer As a volunteer at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, I have worked primarily in the Diagnostic Testing Services Center, where I am tasked with helping patients and their families feel comfortable upon beginning their hospital visit. I provide assistance to patients in navigating the hospital and perform clerical duties as needed. I plan to continue volunteering this summer and during the 2013/2014 school year., Pre-Professional Advising Center Administrative Assistant At the University of Cincinnati's Pre-Professional Advising Center, I provide administrative support to all of the university's pre-health and pre-law advisors. I assist the advisors with scheduling of appointments, help to develop workshops, and create documents for the Pre-Professional Advising website. In addition, I communicate with students and parents to ensure their satisfaction with the services provided by the advising office and provide Microsoft Office expertise., Wall Street Journal Student Achievement Award I was one of three marketing students to receive an award at Miami University's Farmer School of Business Honors Day in 2009. The Wall Street Journal Student Achievement Award was established by the Journal to provide national recognition to top graduating seniors in business., Organic Chemistry Supplemental Instruction Leader I will be working as an Organic Chemistry Supplemental Instruction Leader at the University of Cincinnati's Learning Assistance Center during the 2013/2014 school year. The job entails holding sessions outside of class every week to help students with course materials. The review sessions are designed to integrate what students should be learning with how they will be better able to learn it. I will be responsible for creating worksheets designed to help students better understand the concepts taught in Organic Chemistry and will be collaborating closely with the Organic Chemistry professor. In addition, I will serve as a model of successful student behaviors., Honors Organic Chemistry Lab In December 2012, I was invited to participate in the honors section of Organic Chemistry Lab. As one of fourteen students selected, I was trained on various instruments, mostly spectral, and was able to perform real research-based laboratory experiments. Instead of following a step-by-step protocol, I was provided with an outline of the project conducted by the department and challenged to act and think independently, designing my own experiments. I collaborated with the other students in the class to ensure efficient use of time and resources. At the end of the semester, I formally presented the results obtained, which will be used by future classes to further the goals of the research., Half Marathon In May of 2013, I ran Cincinnati's Flying Pig Half Marathon. I signed up for the race in order to become a healthier person and to challenge myself. The experience taught me a great deal about balancing my time, as training often meant sacrificing an extra hour or two of sleep, studying, or social interaction. More importantly, training for the race taught me how to truly push myself both mentally and physically; I was able to overcome the urge to give up and to endure pain. In addition, I was challenged not to compete with others, but to compete with myself, striving to become better than I was the day before., Study Abroad In the summer of 2006, I studied abroad in Dijon, France. While in France, I took two courses: French Conversation and Current Events and Medieval Architecture, both of which were taught by French professors who did not speak English. While living in the small town, I was able to become proficient in French and travel throughout the country., Animal Shelter Volunteer In the winter/spring of 2012, I spent 4-5 hours every Sunday morning volunteering at a no-kill animal shelter. I administered medication to the dogs at the shelter each week and assisted with activities such as cleaning kennels and fundraising. In addition, I assisted with dogs requiring additional attention - the mean or difficult canines., Shadowing Over the course of the year, I have had the opportunity to shadow a psychiatrist, Dr. Pierce Johnston, and a pediatrician, Dr. Susan Wiley. I was able to observe the doctors' interactions with their patients and was also given the chance to interact with the patients myself. These interactions not only provided me with more insight into the daily activities performed by medical practitioners, but also confirmed my dedication and desire to become a physician.,  Supplemental Instruction - Organic Chemistry, University Organization President What's in a Doctor's Bag presents to local children, educating them about the events that occur during a doctor's visit and alleviating their fears, while also participating in many community service events. The group disassembled about a year before I took office, so I was tasked with generating interest in the group and recruiting quality members. I created the group's constitution and bylaws, and designed an executive board and the duties of each position. I have been in charge of keeping all executive board members on track, communicating with the group's advisor and other university officials, and ensuring compliance with all university policies., Vice President of Membership - Service Fraternity While studying at Miami University, I held the role of Vice President of Membership of Kappa Kappa Psi, an honorary service fraternity. This leadership position required me to educate all future members of the fraternity about its purpose, goals, and history. I was responsible for holding weekly meetings with the organization's prospective members, which involved creating weekly agendas and lesson plans, and was an experience that improved my public speaking abilities. I also organized weekly social activities for active and prospective members., Music Ensembles and Private Flute Lessons While studying music at Miami University, I participated in many performing groups, including Wind Ensemble, Symphony Orchestra, Marching Band, Wind Quintet, Flute Choir, Symphony Band, and Athletic Band. In addition, I had the opportunity to perform at many recitals. Being a member of these ensembles taught me the art of dedication. Unlike performing as a soloist, being a member of an ensemble meant that my level of preparation would either enhance or detract from the entire group's performance; in this sense, these ensembles taught me about teamwork and selflessness. I also taught private flute lessons for several years, an experience that taught me about communication and leadership., Research Assistant While working as a research assistant, I was responsible for performing genotyping in order to determine differences in the genetic makeup of mice being studied as part of breast cancer research. This was done in order to further understand the molecular mechanism of gene expression regulation and its impacts on health and diseases. This experience gave me exposure to real laboratory research, and I was able to learn many laboratory techniques., Veterinary Assistant While working as a veterinary technician at Banfield, I was responsible for educating clients about preventive care and pet health needs. Often referred to as a Pet Nurse, I obtained relevant information and history from clients and maintained proper and complete medical charts. In addition, I obtained body temperature readings, pulse rates, and respiration rates and administered vaccines. I worked closely with the veterinarians, supporting them and the veterinary technicians to ensure quality veterinary care for all pets."

    "text": "Everyones time is precious and nothing made me realize this more than losing my grandmother.  This is our story: She was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 77 and her condition gradually worsened from using a cane to being bedridden.  After a short time, Grandma moved to our basement.  A hospice agency provided support and I did everything in my power to make her comfortable.  After a tremendous battle with liver and bone cancer, she took her last breath at 3:25 PM, just ten minutes before I returned home from school.  Upon hearing the news, tears trickled down my face; I lowered the rail to her bed, climbed in, and held her tight.  The greatest gift I have experienced in my life is being able to help someone when they needed me the most.  On the other hand, I wish I could have done more.  I wish I had a better understanding of the complexity of the situation and I wish I could have helped in a greater capacity.  Consequently, my experience with my grandma was the genesis of my desire to seek a medical career.    My aspiration to pursue a career in the health field has been reaffirmed through a breadth of experiences and has continued to flourish with my undergraduate studies at The Ohio State University.   I have always been intrigued by the workings of the body and fascinated by the technological advances made in medicine and research.  Therefore, having the opportunities to perform dissections, isolate and sequence DNA, analyze biochemical pathways, gene expression, and cell biology, and develop my understanding of mechanisms underlying microbial pathogenesis have been invaluable in providing a background to assess and analyze complex information.  Working in the chemistry lab, I have gained a solid foundation in the scientific method and acquired constitutive values to apply as an evidence-based physician.  Recently, I was a counselor at a summer camp for children with muscular dystrophy.  It was my goal to provide a sense of achievement and friendship as well as ensure that the campers had a fun and safe week.  I was paired with Andrew, a non-mobile sixteen-year-old diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  Throughout the week, I was able to take care of Andrews physical needs as well as provide emotional support.  We played games, enjoyed arts and crafts, danced, swam, and fished, sharing everlasting special moments.  The campers and counselors were incredibly amazing and inspiring people and have truly changed my life.  This experience put life into perspective as I recognized just how much these children rely on others for even the most basic needs  like going to the bathroom or getting into bed.   The time I have spent volunteering at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center has also impacted me both personally and professionally.  Over the course of three years, I have worked in the Central Pharmacy, Ross Dispatch, and Ambulatory Surgical Unit and I feel enriched by every individual I have encountered there.  I really enjoyed working in a clinical setting and learning how a hospital operates.  Even more rewarding was the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of people functioning at their emotional highs and lows.  I learned that every person has a story to tell.  I marveled at their unique stories and appreciated how each person is validated and empowered when sharing their history.  In those moments I became the caregiver, providing comfort, support, and encouragement while I transported them through the hospital.  Additionally, having the opportunity to shadow two physicians was powerful.  I observed firsthand the administration of anesthesia as well as several surgeries including a tonsillectomy, an arthroscopy, and a robotic surgery.  It was a very insightful experience and I feel even more driven to pursue a medical career.  I realize that a career in medicine typically does not provide a normal workweek and poses the possibility of long hours with an on-call schedule.  While working these extensive hours, I am aware that physicians are required to perform work that is physically, mentally, and emotionally demanding.  Although there are explicit sacrifices involved when pursuing this career path, I cannot imagine spending my working years in any other professional field; I am enthusiastic and driven to put in the work for a dream I have possessed since childhood.  The wonder of exploring the human body, the privilege of being trusted to impart advice, and the appreciation for helping people through adversity are priceless.  Most importantly, I take pride in helping others and want to be the kind of doctor that cares with a smile and is committed to healing and education. COSI: Discover Chemistry “Discover Chemistry” is a program put on by the Center of Science and Industry (COSI) to help middle school children learn and become interested about careers in chemistry.  I was tasked with leading a group of eight throughout the museum.  To help the group stay focused and attentive, I maintained an enthusiastic and engaging demeanor while challenging them to think critically to explain certain scientific principles or phenomena., Marching Band, Pep Band and Wind Ensemble As a member of band for four years, I had the chance to build strong friendships as well as develop my talents in music.  Through dedication and practice, I attained a position on the Saint Xavier Drumline. During my senior year, I was elected tenor section leader and worked to enhance the group’s skills.  In addition to concerts and half-time shows, we attended parades, supported the Buddy Walk, and played in our school’s pep rallies., Server As a server, my aim was to go above and beyond the obligation to please the customer.  I strove to increase customer satisfaction by being personable and ensuring that orders were accurate and made with high quality.  Also, in effectively addressing customer complaints within the store, potentially confrontational situations were quickly diffused.  Being a high quality server provided me an opportunity to further enhance my time management and communicative skills as well as effectively adapt to many situations., Honors Student/Dean's List As a student at The Ohio State University, I pride myself on taking my education seriously.  I am motivated to learn and have a genuine interest in knowledge.  Through persistence, I have achieved an honors status and a place on the Dean’s List every quarter/semester of my undergraduate career:  [Autumn Quarter 2010  Winter Quarter 2011  Spring Quarter 2011 Autumn Quarter 2011 Winter Quarter 2012 Spring Quarter 2012 Autumn Semester 2012 Spring Semester 2012], Volunteer at The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center Being a volunteer of the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center, it was my goal to provide service to patients, visitors, and staff.  Over the course of three years, I have held three positions.  In the Dispatch/Ross Patient Unit, I visited with patients, stocked room supplies, ran errands, and aided in patient discharges.  At the Central Pharmacy, I prepared prescriptions and assisted with general office duties.  Most recently, I worked in the Ambulatory Surgical Unit where I prepared pre-op materials for patients and escorted patients from ASU P/S to the pre-op area.,  Chemistry Laboratory Assistant, Chemistry Demo Lab Assistant I am currently employed as a Chemistry Demo Lab Assistant at The Ohio State University, which  entails preparing and explaining laboratory experiments for professors to utilize while teaching chemistry lectures.  Working in a lab, it is necessary to uphold a safe work environment by following proper procedure, especially when dealing with potentially hazardous chemicals, and maintaining and cleaning laboratory instruments and equipment.  This work experience allows me to utilize a broad understanding of chemistry on a daily basis and apply what I know to help others understand complex chemistry concepts., MDA Summer Camp Counselor MDA Summer Camp is a week-long camp devoted to children with varying neuromuscular diseases and gives them the chance to meet others with similar needs and have fun.  As a counselor, it was my aim to provide a sense of freedom and friendship as well as act as a source of physical and emotional support.  Throughout the week, campers and counselors worked together and participated in activities ranging from archery and swimming to arts and crafts., Anesthesiologist and Urogynecologist Shadowing provided me with direct clinical experience and gave me a good idea of what it is actually like to work as a doctor.  Through my experience with Dr. Mark Ziegler, I was able meet with patients, observe the administration of anesthesia, and talk with doctors while viewing several surgeries throughout the day.  I also shadowed Dr. Steve Kleeman, a urogynecologist and pelvic reconstructive surgeon at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati.  With Dr. Kleeman, I was fortunate enough to observe a robotic surgery.  Being present in the operating room was a memorable experience and cemented my desire to become a physician., Boy Scouts/Eagle Scout Taking part in the Boy Scout program was an invaluable experience for me by providing a means by which I could learn practical life lessons such as leadership, friendship, and outdoor skills.  As an active member, I assumed four positions over the course of seven years: scribe, librarian, patrol leader, and assistant senior patrol leader.  One of the benefits I experienced while being a leader was learning the significance of inspiring and teaching younger scouts the skills and values that I have gathered through the years., Maximus Scholarship The Maximus Scholarship is awarded to students ranking in the top three percent of their graduating class and achieving an ACT score of 32 or higher.,  Valet, Valet While working two years as a valet, I assisted in parking and retrieving customer’s vehicles, handling monetary transactions, promptly addressing and rectifying customer inquiries and concerns, and training incoming workers.  I was able to interact with people from diverse backgrounds as well as promote teamwork and organization to provide dependable and consistently superior customer service."

    "text": "Heart racing and hands sweating, I awkwardly slid my tied feet to the edge of the platform so that my toes hung over the edge of the 44 meter drop to the Nile River below. After a long pause, the instructor yelled, 3...2...1...BUNGEE, and I did what I formerly thought no sane human being would do: I jumped. Risk taking, from my experience, is vital to accomplishing great feats. While my bungee jump did not save a life or help me to find a cure to a life-threatening disease, that jump allowed me to finally conquer my fear of heights, a personal accomplishment that left a lasting impression on my life. Taking risks distinguishes a great leader from those whom are simply adequate. Doctors are faced with challenges and difficult decisions every day in which taking a risk is necessary; embracing the unknown is required for any successful career in the realm of science. I believe that welcoming a risk of this caliber with open arms is indicative of my willingness to take risks in the medical field and assert myself as a leader in the future.  My initial motive to pursue medicine was rather immature: a seventh grader who thought she was destined to become a doctor after having a revelation during a frog dissection lab. At that time, I had no idea what being a physician entailed. While the dissection experience ignited my passion for the sciences, further investigation of this ambition was necessary in order to begin my path towards a career in medicine. As early as the eighth grade I began shadowing physicians, and in high school I was accepted to the Aultman Academy program, where I spent two hours of each school day at the local hospital shadowing a variety of health professionals. Despite my early start, my pursuit of medicine did not come without obstacles or second guessing throughout the years. My college courses confirmed my passion for science, and I left each shadowing experience with a newfound energy for the field, but what truly verified my decision to pursue medicine was my work with the underserved in America and abroad.  As a poverty studies minor and social advocate, I am well-educated on the circumstances surrounding poverty. My studies and volunteer experiences have allowed me to empathize with the underprivileged, and realize that poverty is a cycle; the so-called American Dream is not within everyones reach. While I once believed that education was the key to eradicating poverty, my trip to Uganda and my interactions with the homeless in America made me realize that health is an even larger piece to this puzzle. Education is crucial to fortifying all societies, but absences in school and in the workplace due to illness serve as setbacks to any advancements made. The time I spent in Uganda changed my perception of the health crisis when I saw the extent of the poverty in the country: not even the citizens most basic health needs were met. When one of my colleagues became very ill, we discovered that the nearest doctor lived over an hour away. We were fortunate that, as privileged Americans, we could afford to pay for the doctor to make the trip, but the same could not be said for most Ugandans. The lack of access to adequate healthcare is a problem in our own country as well. While volunteering at homeless shelters, I heard countless stories about how an illness or injury caused an individual to lose his or her job due to lengthy absences. Health is not only a key to relieving the poverty crisis, but it is also an essential ingredient to living a happy life. Becoming a physician would allow me to do what I can to secure this innate right for all people, regardless of race, gender, or social class. It is clear that the needs of the poor have not been satisfied, and I believe that my past experience as a leader demonstrates that I possess the skills necessary to fill this gap. Though working in an underserved area is associated with numerous risks to my personal life, I am ready to embrace these risks in order to become a leader and a voice for the poor in the field of healthcare.  Aside from my mission trip and my time spent as a volunteer, I learned the importance of health in leading a happy life from my own personal experience. I battled an eating disorder during the summer before and the fall of my sophomore year of college when I felt the pressure to lose weight upon becoming a college cheerleader. My grades fell and my physical performance at games decreased when I didnt have the energy to think clearly or meet the physical demands of the sport. Though it was difficult for me to admit that I had a problem, I eventually made the mature decision to ask for help. I felt that confiding in others was taking a risk, but doing so enabled me to grow as a person. That year was one of the most difficult of my life, but I was able to move forward and learn a powerful lesson: health should always be the number one priority. Without good health, I believe it is very difficult to carry out a happy life. Health is an inherent right, though it is often not treated as one. My passion for health and my eagerness to serve as a voice for the poor have influenced me to take those risks that are necessary to ensure that every person that I serve has the right to adequate healthcare. University of Notre Dame Undergraduate Admissions Tour Guide As a tour guide, I have learned how to cater to people's various needs when they visit the University of Notre Dame. I have led tours for prospective students, visiting faculty, children's sports camps, and even Notre Dame alum. Each group comes to the campus for very different reasons, so I have learned to cater my tour towards the information that is most important to them. Through working as a tour guide, I have strengthened both my communication and public speaking skills, and have become more personable as a result.,  front desk monitor, Healthwin Nursing Home volunteer Healthwin Nursing Home is a home specialized for patients with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. On Saturday mornings, I volunteered and participated in the nails at nine event where a group of students would give the ladies of the home manicures. I also assisted in transporting patients to and from their rooms. Working at Healthwin was difficult at times, especially when the patients I worked with had more severe forms of Alzheimer's or dementia. Despite the challenges, the residents at the home were inspiring, which always caused me to leave in high spirits., GlobeMed at Notre Dame I joined GlobeMed at Notre Dame in its second year of running at my university. GlobeMed is a national organization with chapters at universities across the United States. Our club at Notre Dame is paired with a grassroots health organization in Laos known as the Promotion for Education and Development Association (PEDA). We fundraise for this organization in order to help fund malaria prevention projects that they carry out in their country. Late this July, I will embark on a global health internship in Laos in order to assist with the execution of the projects that our club funds. The club holds weekly meetings where we discuss issues in global health and propose solutions., Rebuild Tuscaloosa Project I participated in a service trip to Tuscaloosa, Alabama with a group of fellow athletes from Notre Dame. We traveled to Tuscaloosa in order to assist in the cleanup efforts after horrendous tornadoes destroyed much of the city the previous spring. I spent a week cleaning up rubble and clearing the ground to prepare for the actual rebuilding of homes. The experience was very humbling, and I had the opportunity to speak with some of the tornado survivors about their experiences. The amount of gratitude that we received during this trip showed me that even small efforts can create monumental change in another person's life., Urban Plunge I participated in two Urban Plunges during my winter breaks in 2011 and 2012. My first Urban Plunge was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where I had the chance to live at a homeless shelter for 48 hours. I heard many individuals' stories and completed a variety of service work. My group also met with several nonprofits in the area which all aimed to help the poor. Most notably, we visited the Catholic Charities Free Health Care Center, an organization that provides medical services at no cost to individuals who lack employer-sponsored health insurance. My second Urban Plunge was in Cleveland, Ohio, where I worked with the Cleveland Catholic Worker on a variety of projects., Kroc Institute Office Assistant I recently began my job at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at Notre Dame, and it has already proven to be extremely rewarding. My job consists mostly of clerical duties, but I also had the opportunity to help with the events of the Summer Institute, where faculty from universities all over the nation and even across the globe come to Notre Dame for a peace studies conference. I met amazing individuals during the Summer Institute who have great plans for changing our world. This job has also allowed me to learn more about the subject of peace studies, something I believe to be important with all of the turmoil in this day and age., Play Like a Champion Today Initiative: Uganda I traveled to Uganda with twelve other students and three advisors. We worked through the Play Like a Champion Initiative and Fields of Growth, two programs that emphasize the values that can be learned through athletics. These programs strive to bring the lessons of sport to children in third world countries. The mission of our trip was to encourage social development through sport, focusing on women empowerment by encouraging young girls to become involved in athletic activities as well. We visited numerous schools during our time there, teaching the children the Play Like a Champion lessons and then hosting field days and sports tournaments in which the children would participate., Undergraduate research in the Pfrender lab I work closely with graduate student Sayanty Roy in an ecological genomics lab. Participating in a research lab has allowed me to learn more about the scientific process and various procedures outside of a classroom setting. During a lab associated with a class, a student can usually refer to a lab manual for the answers that he or she is seeking. This is not the case for a research project, therefore allowing me to bolster my problem solving skills. Through my lab work I have learned just how much work a research project requires and I have become familiar with various lab techniques and devices. Research has shown me what the science field is like beyond the classroom., Physician Shadowing (Informal) Informal shadowing experiences have played a crucial role in my pursuit of medicine. I had the opportunity to shadow Dr. Roger Vazquez, a neonatologist, on two separate occasions. I am also hoping to observe a delivery later this summer. During my fall break from classes, I traveled to St. Louis to shadow Dr. Mark Grady, a pediatric cardiologist at St. Louis Children's Hospital. Finally, I shadowed Dr. Kent Ramsey, an ear nose and throat specialist. With Dr. Ramsey I had the opportunity to observe a dozen tonsillectomies, many ear tube insertions, and a thyroidectomy as well. These experiences allowed me to gain a better understanding of what a day in the life of a physician entails., Center for the Homeless Volunteer My time spent as a volunteer at the Center for the Homeless in South Bend has been an invaluable experience. The majority of my time was spent working at the center’s main desk checking guests in, opening their medical lockers, and answering any questions that they may have had. Many of the guests talked to me and told me their stories, which often included how they ended up at the center and what work they were doing to get back on their feet. This experience taught me so much about the underprivileged and allowed me to empathize with them, realizing that the cycle of poverty is very difficult to escape., Cheerleading Notre Dame cheerleading is a very time consuming but rewarding activity. I cheer for football games (home and away), men's and women's basketball games, men's and women's soccer games, and women's volleyball games. In addition to all of the games, I also cheer at pep rallies and participate in various community events through cheerleading, such as visits to nursing homes, children's hospitals, and elementary schools. I was captain of my team for the 2012-2013 school year. My duties as captain included sending multiple emails per week to keep everyone informed, organizing performances at games, and ensuring that all members of the team practiced safety while performing stunts., Summer Nanny Serving four children for eight hours a day, five days a week helped me to become more patient, responsible, and understanding of others’ needs. Two of the children I cared for were under the age of six when I began working for the family, which meant I had to be innovative in creating games and activities to keep them entertained. It was also my responsibility to feed and clothe the younger children, and to chauffeur the older two to their respective games and practices. This experience made me realize my love for working with children, something I hope to continue doing as a physician., Take Ten Take Ten is a program that emphasizes nonviolence as a solution to conflict. I worked with another Notre Dame student to teach second graders at Perley Elementary school the Take Ten curriculum, which proved to be more difficult than I imagined. The elementary school is located in an urban area, and many of the children who attend the school are accustomed to resorting to physical measures to solve their problems. Educating these kids about the importance of using their words instead of their fists was a challenge, but I believe our message did get through to them., March of Dimes Internship (Unpaid) The project that I primarily worked on during my internship was the March for Babies, an annual walk hosted by March of Dimes to raise funds for research to decrease the frequency of premature births. I created press releases, contacted past donors, and met with numerous businesses about donating to the event. This internship also allowed me to learn more about the causes and effects of prematurity in America, which sparked my interest on the topic. My time with March of Dimes affected my pursuit of medicine by influencing me to further research neonatology as a specialty.,  Tour Guide"

    "text": "Behind every door of the Terry Reilly Health Services clinic in Nampa, Idaho, is a new patient, a different story, and an opportunity to learn the most effective way to address his or her health concerns. Just as opening the door to each exam room at Terry Reilly promises something unexpected and challenging, my path to becoming a doctor, first at Indiana University then at the University of Notre Dame, has opened many doors to unexpected and wonderful experiences.  My experiences at Terry Reilly, as a clinical psychology research assistant, and as a volunteer in my community have affirmed my goal of practicing medicine and directed me toward an interest in serving others by opening doors to healthcare.       On my first day volunteering at Terry Reilly this summer I immediately started taking patient histories.  Dr. Black knew that I wanted to improve my Spanish comprehension and speaking ability, but taking patient histories in Spanish was certainly out of my comfort zone.  I was very apprehensive of my first patient encounter beyond the exam room door.  I have taken years of Spanish classes, have volunteered with Hispanic children at La Casa de Amistad in South Bend, Indiana, and have discerned an interest in pursuing Medical Spanish programs, yet I still had difficulty communicating clearly with the first few Hispanic patients. I steadily improved my ability to discuss medical issues with Terry Reillys Hispanic patients and simultaneously gained an appreciation for the importance of clear communication in medicine. I can only imagine the frustration that many Spanish-speaking patients feel when seeking care at clinics in the U.S.  The ability to speak the same language as the patient opens doors to higher quality care.      Although I did not have a clear understanding of the intangible aspects of practicing medicine, such as the importance of communication, when I first began considering a career in the medical field, my initial reasons for wanting to become a doctor remain some of my strongest motivators to this day. During my childhood I was immersed in the world of healthcare, sharing this interest with my older sister.  My father, a family doctor, enjoyed sharing his experiences with my siblings and me by taking us to visit newborns in the hospital as well as elderly patients in the nursing home. The looks of confidence, joy, and relief on the faces of my fathers patients strongly resonated with me as a child, guiding my interest in medicine.        Due to my fathers influence, I have dedicated much of my extracurricular time to service and healthcare in order to discern my own calling to become a physician.  When I was younger, I believed that becoming a doctor was a challenging but predictable path that eventually culminated in a career with the potential to influence a community.  I have not wavered on the path to becoming a doctor but have found it to be more circuitous, winding in unexpected ways with experiences that have opened doors to new goals. As a Spanish major, I enjoy the challenge of learning another language and about other cultures.  This opportunity has opened me up to a wider population, which is increasingly important as the percentage of Spanish-speaking citizens continues to rise in the U.S. Immersed as I was at Terry Reilly, I have discerned that my path to a medical degree includes an interest in continuing to develop my Spanish skills with the hope of being able to meet the needs of every patient beyond the next door, no matter his or her first language.      My experiences as a research assistant in the Center for the Advanced Measurement of Personality and Psychopathology (CAMPP) with Dr. Lee Anna Clark have encouraged a passion to better understand the connection between the mind and body.  By working with people with mental disorders, I have observed that the health of the mind can play an important role in determining how well a person will respond to a treatment plan to heal the body. Many of the participants that I prepare for involvement in our study impart the many doors that have closed to them due to uncontrolled mental illness. The pervasive connection between mental illness, poverty, and poor health has become extremely apparent to me through my experiences at the CAMPP lab and at the Terry Reilly clinic.  As a physician, I would have a platform to combat this issue by dedicating myself to the health of the mind and the body of each patient, no matter his or her socioeconomic background.  Upon opening the door to an exam room to evaluate a patient, a doctor is able to work to keep doors open for the patient to better health, mentally and physically.       The challenge of each new case that waits beyond the next door excites me, but the intangible and emotional aspects of practicing medicine inspire me. Along the path I have taken, I have discovered that my calling to be a physician is founded in service and compassionate care. I can never fully anticipate what lies beyond the next door, what kind of medical case or type of patient, but learning many of the important, intangible components of practicing medicine has prepared me to navigate the unpredictable world of healthcare. Volunteer at Methodist/Riley Hospital for Children During high school I volunteered at Methodist Hospital and Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis.  These experiences solidified my intent to pursue the pre-medical path in college.  It was exciting for me to observe the inner-workings of a hospital and the countless people that a hospital requires to function.  As a volunteer, I helped patients and their families to find their way in the hospital, delivered flowers and gifts, and played with children in the cardiac center.  I believe that this was a meaningful way to spend my summers, and I learned how to work with others professionally through my encounters with patients, nurses, physicians, and administrators., Shadowing at Hendricks Regional Health During one winter break, I spent a week shadowing three different physicians at Hendricks Regional Health in central Indiana.  My experience with Dr. Amy Roberts, a family doctor, was unique because many Hispanic patients come to her due to her Spanish fluency.  This was my first exposure into the ways that, as an aspiring doctor, my interest and knowledge of the Spanish language can provide an important service to the community.  The two other doctors that I shadowed, Dr. Mike Flood and Dr. Robert Hooker, a radiologist and a pathologist, respectively, are specialists in two very different fields.  They provided me a glimpse into the very different diagnostic side of medicine., Dorm Ambassador for student government campaign Freshman year I was recruited to be a dorm ambassador for a group that was running as a student government ticket at Indiana University. As a dorm ambassador, I found a student from each floor of the dorm to be in charge of the campaign on that floor. I worked with these students to find volunteers for voting day and to encourage students to vote. Being in a leadership position, I learned how to clearly communicate with and manage many other people. It required perseverance to find a group of students to dedicate their time to the campaign, and this experience often pushed me out of my comfort zone. Nevertheless, I believe that I grew in confidence as a result of this experience.,  hostess, Summer Service Learning Program I am working at Terry Reilly Health Services, a system of clinics in and nearby Boise, Idaho. The SSLP combines community service and clinical exposure. My time at Terry Reilly has been spent shadowing Dr. Stuart Black and volunteering in the pharmacy with the Medication Assistance Program. Under the guidance of Dr. Black, I have learned to take patient medical histories, in English and in Spanish, and to present this information to Dr. Black. By observing Dr. Black I have learned about the care of pregnant women and patients with diabetes, among many other conditions. Highlights of this summer include helping Dr. Black deliver a baby and learning how to use a colonoscopy scope., Volunteering at Cathedral Soup Kitchen I have been a volunteer at the Cathedral Soup Kitchen in Indianapolis since grade school, and I was inspired to begin volunteering there by my church.  When I am home, I go to the Cathedral Soup Kitchen on Friday mornings with my mother, a regular volunteer.  I help to prepare and serve food to the homeless men and women in the city. While in college, it can be easy to become overly focused on personal growth and the pursuit of egocentric goals.  Working with the homeless puts my life into perspective and serves as a reminder to not take the gifts I have been given for granted.  Volunteering has given me proficiency in relating to and understanding the issues plaguing many diverse people., Being a nanny for three children I was a nanny for two summers for three children, and I discovered how much work it requires to care for three children. Many days I came home mentally and physically exhausted, but I felt reassured that the work I was doing was meaningful. The youngest girl has Down syndrome, so she required a lot of attention. She is an incredibly loving child, and I bonded with her right away. I particularly enjoyed helping her to prepare for her speech therapy sessions each week. My speech therapy knowledge was limited, but the practice activities and exercises were very interesting. Working with children provided me insight into the ways that children think about and approach the world., Research Assistant in a clinical psychology lab I work for Dr. Lee Anna Clark, a world-renowned personality psychologist who received a five-year grant to examine the relationship between personality and psychopathology.  My duties as a research assistant include preparing participants for the study, transitioning participants between surveys and interviews, and entering data.  I am also being trained to interview informants for the study.  Because I work so closely with the participants, I am able to determine ways that the study can run more smoothly and efficiently.  I share these ideas at the weekly lab meetings.  At these meetings, graduate students share their work, so I have the opportunity to learn about other research., Working as a hostess at Abuelo's Mexican Embassy I worked at Abuelo's Mexican Embassy, a restaurant, for three summers starting after I graduated from high school.   My duties as a hostess included seating tables, controlling the wait for the tables, and updating the managers on the status of the restaurant.        Working in the food industry requires a lot of patience, attention to the needs of others, and the ability to multitask.  One of my favorite aspects of working at a restaurant was talking to many diverse people.  I enjoyed hearing about peoples' lives, their jobs, and their families.  A large portion of the money that I made went towards helping my parents with tuition and paying for books., Tutor at La Casa de Amistad La Casa de Amistad is an after-school program for Hispanic children in South Bend, IN. I worked with the fourth and fifth graders to help them complete their homework and to encourage them to spend some time reading.  One boy required extra attention because he had trouble with reading comprehension.  Each week I helped him with his Science homework and tried to teach him how to absorb what he is reading in his textbook.  It was rewarding to see him slowly improve and gain confidence.  Often I would organize games to help the children learn and practice new Spanish words because as they were speaking more English at school, they needed help to maintain their Spanish.,  Resident Assistant, Gospel of Life Seminar The Gospel of Life Seminar through the Center for Social Concerns consisted of both a classroom component and an immersion in Washington D.C. for a week during fall break.  The seminar focused on ethical issues regarding life, such as abortion, the death penalty, and the use of embryonic stem cells.  In Washington D.C. I had the opportunity to meet with the National Right to Life Foundation, Feminists for Life, the Family Research Center, and the Death Penalty Information Center. Through weekly journals and a final paper, I was able to explore more thoroughly my reaction to various readings and to class discussions., Resident Assistant This past spring I received the honor of being named a Resident Assistant for my dorm, Farley Hall, at Notre Dame.  As an RA, I will be responsible for the safety and well being of a group of girls. I am expected to enforce the rules of the dorm and of campus. Being chosen as an RA means that my rector has confidence in my leadership, my character, and my ability to work well with other people. I wanted to apply to become an RA to give back to the community that welcomes me, provides support, and influences my personal growth. I am looking forward to fostering the same sense of community that I have experienced and to creating an environment of inclusion, academic integrity, and friendship., Hutton Honors College Scholarship, Indiana University Upon being automatically invited to enter the Hutton Honors College at Indiana University as a freshman, I was awarded a scholarship from the Hutton Honors College.  They award these scholarships to students who showed excellence in high school, which includes taking the most rigorous courses, participating in extracurricular activities, and performing well on standardized tests., Hall clerk of my dorm, Farley Hall When I transferred to Notre Dame, I immediately loved the dorm life on campus.  I wanted to get involved in my dorm, so I became the hall clerk.  As hall clerk, I worked closely with the rector to organize hall data, assist during move-in and move-out days, advertise events around campus, and plan ahead for the coming year. Through my capacity as hall clerk, I met many of the girls in the dorm and was recognized as having a leadership role.  I believe that dorm life creates a welcoming community, and my involvement in the more logistical side of the dorm helped to foster the continuation of the community."

    "text": "Engage the flow.  These were the words of my close mentor Dr. Michael Ruppe during an interview on how to be a thriver for my honors seminar, A Course in Thriving.  This concept of flow was very new to me as a sophomore undergraduate student.  However, my recent discovery of the topic made flow no less intriguing to me.  I have learned in my course and from Dr. Ruppe that flow experiences are those in which you become completely engaged and absorbed.  When youre in the midst of a flow experience, time is not a factor and you would not rather be anywhere else than where you are in that moment.  But most importantly, I believe that my discovery of flow is what has enabled me to articulate my passion for medicine better than ever before.  As Ive learned through extensive shadow experience, I am called to medicine because it flows for me; it is a field in which I believe I will thrive.  There are many aspects of medicine that make it flow so significantly for me.  These reasons that medicine creates flow in my life include connection with other human beings, intellectual engagement, and an overall sense of purpose.  One of the main aspects of medicine that makes it a flow experience is how it enables me to connect with other human beings on so many levels.  The first and most important of these connections is that of serving others.  Giving to other people and feeling that sense of fulfillment is an experience that I have always cherished.  Furthermore, medicine offers a chance for me to connect with other people through empathy.  I hope to practice medicine with empathy as a top priority in order to best care for patients and their humanity.  Ive also learned about the value of empathy in my role as a volunteer with Project Sunshine at Kosair Childrens Hospital.  We interact with children and families who light up at the thought of just sharing time, passions, or stories with someone who cares.  Its an incredibly rewarding experience to share these moments of empathy or just plain fun with the children that we serve.   Further yet, medicine flows because it fosters an environment in which I can make connections with other people through teamwork.  One of the most inspiring aspects of medicine is the profound sense of solidarity that exists among the people working in the hospital.  By working together, doctors, nurses, and so many others can make a positive impact in the lives of other people.  This is a meaningful side of medicine for me because I have come to value teamwork already through my experience as a Project Sunshine volunteer.  As one chapter, Project Sunshine volunteers work together in order to achieve our common goal of making a difference in the lives of children and families in the hospital.  In this way, Project Sunshine has taught me about the power of teamwork.  Yet another realm of medicine that fosters flow in my life is that of the intellectual challenge involved.  Being a physician involves problem-solving and challenges that I will welcome with perseverance.  I consider myself to be a lifelong learner and feel drawn to working hard to solve complex problems.  Moreover, I can see that as the field of medicine constantly advances, I will be learning new things throughout my entire career.  Besides engaging my mind with the science of medicine, I see that being physician also involves many ethical considerations and evaluations, which is another intellectually-engaging activity itself.  Overall, I know that the lifelong learning and intellectual engagement associated with medicine will create flow in my life.  One final aspect of medicine that gives it a quality of flow is the meaningful sense of purpose that it nurtures in my heart.  One of my most valued goals is that to lead a life of purpose.  Following my call to medicine is the most purposeful life that I can imagine for myself.  This is because, through medicine, I will use my passions for giving and learning in a meaningful way.  This sense of purpose, along with intellectual challenge and connecting with other people, makes medicine a flow experience that I hope to have for the rest of my life. Big Brothers Big Sisters Mentor As a Big Sister, along with my friend who was a Big Brother, I had the opportunity to mentor and provide support for an 11-year-old boy through the Big Brothers Big Sisters program.  Together in our trio match, we went on bi-monthly outings to new and diverse sites in the community, such as the science museum, the zoo, and even just home to talk and play board games.  We also strived to be there for our Little to let him know that he is a star and he has a friend in us.  This was a rewarding experience and opportunity to offer friendship to a child in need., Alpha Epsilon Delta Pre-Health Honor Society As an active member of Alpha Epsilon Delta, I engage in interesting forums where professionals in the community speak about medicine, healthcare, and science.  Another component of membership which I really enjoy is that we all volunteer in the community together.  One of our regular volunteer sites is Supplies Over Seas, where we sort surplus medical supplies from the Louisville area to be shipped to developing or underserved nations.  I also look forward to the Festival of Trees and Lights that we volunteer at every year, which is a holiday fundraising event for Kosair Children's Hospital at which we do crafts and activities with children and families who attend the event., Board of Overseers Mentoring Program As part of the Board of Overseers Mentoring Program, I was paired with Dr. Mark Puckett as my mentor with whom I shadowed each month.  Dr. Puckett is a physician in family and sports medicine, so I enjoyed the chance to expand the realm of medicine I've experienced and shadowed.  As a shadow of Dr. Puckett, I learned about medical conditions that affect joints like arthritis, bone health, sprains and strains, as well as things as common as a head cold on the family medicine side of things.  I learned a great deal from my role as a shadow of Dr. Puckett and enjoyed experiencing an outpatient side of medicine that I haven't seen in the hospital., Americorps Bonner Leader Program Being a Bonner Leader was a rewarding chance to make a tangible difference at a specific site in the Louisville community.  My main site was Project Sunshine, an organization of which I served as chapter leader in order to coordinate and recruit student volunteers for service at Kosair Children's Hospital.  Another component of the Bonner program was leadership conferences, in which we learned about common commitments such as civic engagement and social justice.  I also went on an Alternative Spring Break mission trip to Asheville, NC as a Bonner Leader.   After a meaningful year of service, I was humbled to receive the Bonner Leader of the Year Award in April 2012., Physician Shadowing at Kosair Children's Hospital Being a shadow of Dr. Michael Ruppe in the Pediatric ICU at Kosair Children's Hospital has been extremely rewarding.  I have been shadowing Dr. Ruppe on a monthly basis for a year and a half now and have learned and experienced so much.  I have enjoyed opportunities to shadow rounds, call nights, open heart surgeries, and so much more.  I am grateful for this experience because it has helped me to discover my passion for working with children in medicine.  I have also learned a great deal about the lifestyle of a physician in the critical care setting and developed a resourceful mentor relationship as a premedical student., Project Sunshine Chapter Leader/President I love my role as chapter leader in the Louisville chapter of Project Sunshine.  I became involved in Project Sunshine as a volunteer during my freshman year and took on the role of chapter leader as a sophomore.  Project Sunshine is a national non-profit organization that creates recreational and social programs for children and families who face medical challenges in facilities all over the world.  In the Louisville area, our chapter of Project Sunshine serves children and families at Kosair Children's Hospital. In addition to our direct service in the hospital, our chapter volunteers on campus to plan crafts for in-hospital events as well as make gifts like Sunny Grams for the kids., Patient and Family Ambassador at Kosair Children's Hospital I value my role as a Patient and Family Ambassador at Kosair Children's Hospital because it is a chance for me to give to a community for which I care very deeply.  In this role, I check on patients to see if they have any needs for something as simple as a drink or extra diapers.  I also love to talk to or do crafts with children who need someone to spend time with.  I also enjoy delivering cheer cards to patients, even if it just means bringing a smile to their face.  After a year or so as an experienced volunteer, my manager has entrusted me with hosting large volunteer groups who wish to visit patients as well as training new volunteers who have applied to volunteer as ambassadors., Freshmen LEAD Program I was engaged in the Freshman LEAD program during my first year at the University of Louisville.  Freshmen LEAD was a great opportunity to discover and strengthen my leadership qualities for my future college career.  My top 5 strengths as a freshman from the StrengthsFinder assessment were Achiever, Belief, Futuristic, Discipline, and Competition. Through this program, we performed service in the Louisville community and engaged in leadership workshops, as well as learned about the many leadership opportunities and resources on campus.  I believe that my role in Freshmen LEAD enabled me to network on campus and led me to one of my most beloved organizations, Project Sunshine., International Service Learning in Tanzania My medical mission to Tanzania was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had.  Along with 20 other college students, I had the chance to reach out to medically underserved populations in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania.  We conducted village triage by visiting homes, collected health data, recorded vital signs, educated on disease prevention, and hosted medical clinics alongside regional physicians.  In order to maximize the academic value of this experience, I conducted an independent study of prevalent human disease in tropical regions like Tanzania, including malaria and numerous parasitic and fungal diseases; I studied biological causes and clinical aspects of each., CAPS Leader and Honors 101 Assistant for Incoming Freshmen My role as a CAPS Leader and Honors 101 Assistant is meaningful to me for many reasons.  CAPS stands for Civic. Academic. Personal. Social and is a program that is meant to orient new freshman students to the University through a mentor relationship with an upperclassman CAPS Leader.  I love this job because it is a chance for me to help eliminate anxieties, answer questions, and instill excitement in new students.  Although most of the summer program is conducted via email, I always look forward to Welcome Week and orientation for the Honors 101 courses, when I have the opportunity to meet my student mentees and build lasting relationships so that they know a friendly face on campus., Lab Team Member My role in Dr. Remold's lab was a unqiue learning experience for me. My first project that I completed was the Lab Olympics.  This involved performing timed tasks such as pipetting, micropipetting, and serial dilutions.  I was then placed on the Pseudomonas project, for which I helped sample a human home for the biogeographic distribution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  This is especially relevant for families with a child who has CF.  However, in the end I had to be honest with myself and Dr. Remold that this lab was not where my passions lie and I could not dedicate the time necessary with the other service activities in which I was engaged.,  Serving,  Student mentoring, University of Louisville Dance Marathon ULDM is an event that I look forward to and cherish every year.  I have been a fundraiser and dancer for ULDM every year because it is such a fun and meaningful cause.  Each school year, I start to raise funds in October to benefit Kosair Children's Hospital.  Then, over 300 student dancers come together for the dance marathon in March and dance the night away for the children who cannot.  I think that it is a wonderful opportunity for UofL students and the greater Louisville community to come together for a cause to support children in the hospital."

    "text": "One could easily say I was always destined for some sort of career in repair. As a child I was heavily influenced by my fathers do-it-yourself mentality, and I loved helping him with projects such as replacing worn out brake drums on our old Honda or building the retaining wall by the creek in our front yard. I quickly found that one of my favorite hobbies was simply repairing just about anything within my ability that had broken; I could get enjoyment out of the opportunity to fix something, whereas many others might only find disappointment that it was damaged. While succeeding in the challenge of repairing something was rewarding, I think more of the enjoyment came from the fact that I would have to truly comprehend the system I was working on in order to repair it, and so success would serve as a confirmation that I actually understood how that system worked. Repairs would also often push me to be creative in how I solved them  I once effectively replaced an integral broken plastic piece on a remote control car with the top of an acorn  and I came to find I was adept at working with my hands. This interest has served as a source of motivation throughout my entire life, and it really is the foundation for my decision to go into medicine. Everything breaks eventually, and the human body is no exception. Going into college, then, physics actually caught my attention. I knew I wanted to pursue something in the sciences, and I saw physics and its focus on explaining the natural world on a fundamental scale as catering to my established interest in studying how things work. My decision to major in physics brought another advantage as well  intellectual challenge. Physics was always notorious in my mind as being a difficult subject, and this appealed to me, something I relate back to the challenges I enjoyed while fixing things. While I had to endure many long nights during which I became well acquainted with names like Lagrange, Maxwell, and Einstein, I gained exceptional problem solving skills. So much of physics required taking relatively simple equations and ideas and combining them in complex and novel ways to solve problems, and I think the mindset of being able to take the tools available and easily see how they could be used together in a solution is one that would prove invaluable in a medical career. Not all of my influences to this point have revolved around problems and solutions, however. Music has also played an enormous role in shaping who I am as a medical school applicant. Apart from being a music minor on trumpet, singing has actually become prominent in my life since I auditioned for and made the Denison Hilltoppers acappella vocal group on campus. Music is at its core a performing art, and in performing for and interacting with audiences as a member of the Hilltoppers I have come to appreciate the service aspect that goes along with music. I specifically remember interacting with the residents of a retirement home in Columbus, Ohio, after we had performed an impromptu free concert in their lobby (we thought we would be expected there, but it turned out we had accidentally scheduled the concert with a home of the same name hundreds of miles away in Maryland). They all were so happy to have us, and I loved hearing them reminisce about their college days with us after our performance. The ability to deeply affect others by evoking certain feelings or memories is what has made music so special in my life, and experiences like that surprise concert are going to stick with me. Ultimately, then, my decision to pursue medicine developed as a result of all of these influences acting together. Medicine initially appealed to me early in my undergraduate studies as a great opportunity to spend my career doing what I loved: diagnosing problems and proposing and administering solutions. However, I would be working with the human body instead of an inanimate mechanical system, and so I could directly help the well-being of others and challenge myself daily with its incredible biological and social complexities. I could thus apply my interests in a setting that would be much more rewarding than any purely mechanical one could be. I saw this firsthand as a medical intern last summer, easily the most influential clinical undergraduate experience I have had. As I spent a month with orthopedic surgeon Dr. Jason Hurbanek, one aspect of his work that stood out to me was how closely his emotions were tied to the well-being of his patients. Seeing his disappointment after having a motorcycle-racing patient whose collarbone he had repaired not a week ago come back into the office with the same bone broken again after slipping in the shower, and then seeing his gratification after performing a long and incredibly complex autologous chondrocyte implantation on a high school athletes knee, profoundly indicated to me that the human element of medicine is what pushes it beyond any other career choice I could have. With this, all signs suggest I would enjoy the daily challenges and interactions associated with a medical career, and based on my belief that people do their best work when they are doing something they enjoy, I think that pursuing medicine is absolutely the right choice for me.  Anderson Summer Scholars Program, Research in Phys, Trumpet (Jazz and Classical) I have been playing trumpet in some capacity since fifth grade, where I started through the music program at Loveland Middle School in Ohio. My primary focus has been on jazz playing, although I play classical as well. Through high school I was a member of both our jazz big band and concert band programs. Now at Denison University, I continue to play. I am a music minor on trumpet and am extremely active in our music department; involvement includes the Jazz Ensemble and Jazz Combo among many other groups (most are listed as classes in my transcript). I have also taken trumpet lessons for the majority of the time I have been playing., Denison University Dean's List I have made the Denison University Dean's List (3.7+ GPA for the semester) every semester I have completed while at school here (Fall 2010 through Spring 2013)., Denison University Summer Scholars Research Program, Physics I received a Bowen Grant (Denison Univ) to perform 10 weeks of full-time research. I am part of a team studying electron correlation effects in negative ions, largely through precision measurements of electron affinities and related electronic structure utilizing laser spectroscopy. Lanthanum ions are the primary research topic; additionally, the team will be traveling to the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley, California to study carbon chains in a similar manner using a synchrotron light source. Responsibilities include constructing new apparatus components, operating the ion beam and tunable laser, overseeing data collection, and performing rigorous statistical analysis on collected data., Mortar Board National College Senior Honors Society, Member I was inducted into the Denison Chapter of Mortar Board, a senior honors society, at the end of this past school year. After being offered the chance to apply due to my previous academic achievement at Denison, I was accepted; I joined this group as a means of getting involved with community service and campus leadership. I will be an active member during my upcoming senior year., Society of Physics Students (SPS), Member I was inducted into the Denison chapter of SPS, a student-oriented association aimed at fostering fellowship among those interested in physics as well as preparing them for contribution to the scientific community, by the Department of Physics. For the past year, the group met roughly every other Sunday. Group responsibilities included discussions of current topics in physics as well as community outreach., Internship with Dr. Anne Taylor - Plastic Surgery I was selected to complete this internship after submitting an application through Denison University's Internship Program. As an intern, I completed a month long intensive shadowing experience with Dr. Anne Taylor, gaining a great deal of knowledge on the work and lifestyle of a plastic surgeon. Shadowing took place during all work hours, and included extensive clinic and operating room observation. I was also able to interact with medical students at Ohio State working with Dr. Taylor. Additional responsibilities included learning about relevant anatomy and helping with tasks around the office., Internship with Dr. Jason Hurbanek - Orthopedic Surgery I was selected to complete this internship after submitting an application through Denison University's Internship Program. This internship consisted of a month long intensive shadowing/work experience with Dr. Jason Hurbanek, an orthopedic surgeon. Shadowing took place during all work hours, and included extensive office and operating room observation. Additional responsibilities included assisting with various tasks during clinic visits, preparing recent orthopedic research findings for presentation to Dr. Hurbanek's team, learning relevant anatomy, and taking patient histories.,  Physics Dept Tutor, Sigma Pi Sigma Physics Honor Society, Member Sigma Pi Sigma is the official American physics honors society.

    "text": "There are some children who know at an early age exactly what they want to be when they grow up.   I was just the opposite; I knew what I did not want to be: a doctor.  My mother is a family practice physician.  Growing up, I saw how hard she worked.  She would come home exhausted from a day full of listening to peoples problems and return to the hospital late at night to deliver a baby.   I swore to myself I would never chose that life for myself.  However, as I have grown into my own person and had the opportunity to experience how rewarding medicine can be, I have developed a passion for the profession and can no longer see myself doing anything else. I have had the opportunity to shadow physicians as well as other health care professionals, and I am drawn to the role physicians have on the health care team.  They are service-oriented leaders, decision makers, problem solvers, and life-long learners.  As an undergraduate student, these are values which I have sought to embody.   I am drawn to the direct impact physicians are able to make in the lives of others.  While shadowing a family practice physician, I met a young girl with patellofemoral pain syndrome, a condition I also have.  I was able to encourage her that her symptoms would diminish and that the lifestyle changes suggested by the physician would make a noticeable difference.   As I shared my personal experience, I could see her brighten up and become excited about her treatment plan.  Through this experience, I realized that I wanted to use my passion for science to directly improve the quality of life of others.  I enjoy giving my time and energy to help others through community service.   As a student, I have participated in several opportunities to serve others through my involvement on campus, including Relay for Life, local food drives and health fairs, and as a volunteer at St Ritas Medical Center.  I found participating in the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundations Walk for a Cure particularly rewarding.  The optimism shown by children and families affected by juvenile diabetes about diabetes research and the support shown by the families were inspiring, and I am grateful I was able to bring a smile to their faces.  Not only do I find it rewarding to help others, but more importantly, as someone who has been very blessed, I feel compelled to use my time and talents to give back and serve others.  Another way in which I am able to use my abilities to impact others is through leadership. I am involved in several organizations on campus and hold a leadership position in most of them.   I have both served as president and held other offices.  I believe I make a strong leader because I am efficient at identifying tasks that need accomplished, integrating others into the solution discovery process, and delegating duties to others according to their interests and abilities.  As president of the Alpha Lambda Delta freshmen honors society, my leadership allowed the club to grow from an inactive honorary to an active status by establishing a mentorship program for members to reach out to incoming freshmen, coordinating tutoring sessions, planning community service outreach events, and holding a scholarship informational meeting to raise awareness about the scholarships available to Alpha Lambda Delta members.  I worked with the other officers to plan events and delegate responsibility.  I, however, held the final responsibility for each event and was able to successfully expand the organizations contributions on campus while being involved in other extra-curricular activities and maintaining a 4.0 GPA.    I have had the opportunity to utilize my passion for leadership and service to directly impact others, and want the same for my interest in science.  I find the problem solving process exciting and my inquisitive nature constantly drives me to seek out new information.  My independent study experience in undergraduate research required me to solve methodology problems and interpret data, strengthening my critical thinking skills and fueling my interest in biological research.  I am particularly fascinated by how the human body functions, how microscopic changes can lead to macroscopic symptoms, and how medical treatment can correct those symptoms and improve quality of life.  I want to use my understanding of science to make a direct impact on others lives.  As life-long learners, physicians are uniquely positioned as liaisons between science and society who apply the developments of research to patient care and improve quality of life.  I am driven to pursue a career as a physician by my enthusiasm for science, service, and leadership.  Although the difficult aspects of the job deterred me at first, I now realize that the rewards far outweigh the costs.  This is a profession I am passionate about, not only from an academic standpoint, but from a personal standpoint.  I see medicine as a calling; it is not just an option among career paths, but the sole course for my life. Agape Improv Agape Improv is a Christian acting group on campus that travels to churches in the area and performs original skits.  As president of the organization, I planned and ran rehearsals, promoted the recruitment of new members, communicated the rehearsal and performance schedule to the acting team and planned performances.  I also participated in the creative process of writing, directing, and performing skits., Alpha Lambda Delta (ALD) Freshman Honor's Society ALD is a freshman honors society that recognizes academic achievement in students in their first year of college.  My sophomore year, I served as president of ALD on my campus.  In previous years, the organization had served only as an honorary.  One of my goals as president was to bring the club to a more active status. As president, I worked with the other officers to organize a freshman mentorship program, a study group program, and a scholarship information meeting. We also joined with another group on campus to sponsor a book drive for the Ada library. We were able to meet our goals of serving the campus and the community and left a legacy of involvement for future members., Research in Psychology As a requirement for my experimental psychology course, I worked with a group to design and carry out a novel study entitled “The Effects of Mood and Setting on Impression Formation.”  Before executing the experiment, we investigated current relevant research, prepared a formal research proposal, and obtained IRB approval.  Over the course of several days, we carried out our experimental protocol and collected data.  We analyzed and reported our findings in the form of an unpublished scientific paper and presented a poster at the Ohio Northern Student Research Colloquium., Research in Physiology As a requirement for my medical physiology course, I worked with a group to design and carry out a novel study on the individual and combined effects of caffeine and epinephrine on sustained skeletal muscle contraction in frog gastrocnemii.  Before executing the experiment, we investigated current relevant research, prepared a formal research proposal, and obtained IUACUC approval.  Over the course of several weeks, we carried out our experimental protocol and collected data.  We analyzed and reported our findings in the form of an unpublished scientific paper and presented a poster at the Ohio Northern Student Research Colloquium.,  Chemistry Teaching Assistant, Biology Independent Research During the last two semesters, I have conducted independent research under a research advisor studying the effects of the chemotherapies 5-fluorouracil and gefitinib on egg laying in Drosophila melanogaster.  My responsibilities included researching and presenting relevant studies, providing input on research design, preparing laboratory supplies, maintaining Drosophila stock, carrying out assays, and presenting and interpreting data.  As a leader in the laboratory, I also coordinated and led lab meetings, planned assays, and interpreted collective data., Genetics Tutoring For the last year, I have been employed as a genetics tutor at my college.  I worked with students to ensure a stronger understanding of the subject material, including meiosis, Mendelian and non-Mendelian inheritance, pedigree analysis, genetic mutation, and gene regulation.  I held tutoring sessions on a weekly basis, answered students’ questions, offered exam reviews, and helped students with homework assignments and research projects., Shadowing in Psychiatry For three weeks, I shadowed a psychiatrist at a drug and alcohol abuse rehabilitation center.  I observed several patient interview sessions and learned about the diagnosis and treatment process for mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder and depression., Hospital Volunteering I spent four Saturday mornings volunteering at St. Rita’s Medical Center and helped to coordinate other student volunteers from Ohio Northern.  My primary assignment was to help patients fill out a satisfaction survey about their experience at the hospital.  Additionally, I assisted the nursing staff by bringing patients water, sitting with patients, taking discharged patients down to the parking lot, and restocking the supplies in patient rooms.  While at St. Rita’s, I also had the opportunity to observe nurses and their role in the health care team., Shadowing in Oncology I spent two weeks shadowing an oncologist.  I observed patient visits and learned about managing cancer as a chronic disease.  I also learned about the process behind cancer diagnosis and treatment plan prescription, including the interpretation of pathology reports and PET scans.  Furthermore, I gained an appreciation for the advancements in available cancer treatments.  The oncologist I shadowed encouraged me with his optimism for cancer research; diseases he would not even screen for fifteen years ago are now curable., Kappa Phi Kappa Phi is a Christian women’s organization on campus dedicated to promoting spiritual growth, fellowship, and service.  Through Kappa Phi, I have participated in several community service events, including food drives for the Ada food pantry, Ada park clean up, and childcare services for the Ada United Methodist Church. Additionally, I helped raise money for a sponsor child and national charities.  I also served as the chapter’s chaplain.  As chaplain, my responsibilities included planning special events, preparing a short message for each meeting, and leading a bible study.  Furthermore, as a leader in the organization I worked with the other officers to promote the success of the club., Northern Christian Fellowship (NCF) NCF is a Christian organization that promotes spiritual growth and community service. Through NCF, I have been involved in community service events, including a food distribution outreach. I participated in a campus wide food drive led by NCF and helped to sort and package the food, which was then distributed to houses in the poorer neighborhoods of Ada.  During the last two years, I have served as speaker coordinator for NCF.  My responsibilities included finding and contacting local pastors to speak at weekly NCF meetings and planning large group meetings.  Furthermore, as a leader in the organization, I worked with other officers to plan events and promote the success of the organization., Hospital Shadowing Over the course of several weeks, I shadowed family practice physicians, residents, a registered nurse, and a certified psychologist at the Washington Hospital.  I had the opportunity to observe clinical visits, rounds, mole and skin tag removals, ultrasounds, Papanicolaou tests, and colposcopies.  I also attended weekly lectures given by the residency program.  I observed precepting and listened to the feedback given to residents and medical students from both a physician and a psychologist., Professional Association of Women in Science (PAWS) PAWS is a group of women on campus dedicated to promoting science education and encouraging young women to enter the field of science.  Once a month, PAWS representatives do a science related craft with the children at the child development center on campus, an opportunity in which I regularly participate.  Also, I have participated in the annual Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation’s “Walk for a Cure” through PAWS; we provided face painting and education about the sugar content of common snacks.   This past year, I served as secretary for the organization.  My responsibilities included promoting communication about upcoming events and assisting with logistics., Society of Medical Professionals (SMP) SMP in an organization on campus committed to promoting community service and education in science.  The group sponsors several guest lecturers to expose members to diverse medical career options.  As secretary, I helped to promote communication about upcoming events and assisted with logistics.  I also helped to organize and plan a “Card’s for Kids” event which provided the opportunity for students on campus to make cards for the patients of St. Jude’s Research Hospital.  During Organ Donor Awareness Week, I participated in the organization’s efforts to provide information to students about organ donation and to encourage students to become organ donors., Mortar Board This spring, I applied to and was accepted into the Aurora chapter of Mortar Board.  The selection committee invited thirty individuals based on leadership, campus involvement, community service, and academic achievement.  I was excited to be inducted into this honors society and have already become involved in this organization’s efforts to better our campus.  For Administrative Assistant Appreciation Day, I helped to take orders for flowers and bundle and deliver them to the administrative assistants on campus.  I also attended Mortar Board’s “Last Lecture” series, which gave retiring professors an opportunity to give a lecture of inspiring words to the students."

    "text": "Facta non verba, deeds not words. This Latin translation is the motto of Phi Delta Epsilon, the medical fraternity in which I am privileged to be an active member.  During my college study I have heard the words compassion, integrity, empathy, and service casually tossed around in conversation. It sometimes surprises me that words of such magnitude and importance in healthcare are used so frequently without action. Clearly, these words only become principles for a fulfilling life when they are manifested as deeds.  My life experiences, studies, and the nucleus of facta non verba have awakened me to my calling: a life of service with moral excellence.     My first encounter with medicine was an awakening, and has held significance as a pivotal moment in my life. In February of 2007 I suffered a traumatic skiing accident that resulted in a grade IV spleen laceration. Suffering such a traumatic injury, sustained from my most loved hobby, confronted me with the realization that I was not invincible. My life was placed in the hands of the doctors and nurses in the Intensive Care Unit of Buffalo Childrens Hospital, and my eyes were opened by the selfless compassion and commitment they bestowed. The care I received went beyond  protocol and my healing on all levels flourished under their passionate care. This experience left me with great gratitude and ignited a flame that illuminates my lifes path.      Throughout my college years, the flame grew and the path became more visible as I shaped my identity, discovered my calling, and perpetuated my values, albeit through fits and starts. My desires to better understand the marvels of the body, my academic endeavors, my yearning to serve, my commitment to a healthy lifestyle, and college play time led to constant internal conflict. I developed tendencies to spread myself thin, leaving me incapable of dedicating myself to a satisfying extent in any one aspect. I grew from these challenges and learned to more efficiently manage my time and to focus on the most important things.   Service is something I prioritized and found most rewarding in my pursuit of facta non verba. Volunteering as primary school tutor, I discovered I could both teach and serve as a mentor for students. My leadership and communication skills flourished further in my elected position of Philanthropy Chair in my social fraternity. This vital leadership role helped me mature, as I spearheaded a new Philanthropic event.  The $5,000 raised was committed to the Kids4Cure foundation aimed to eradicate ALS, in honor of the mother of a fraternity brother who suffers from this debilitating disease. These experiences further illuminated my life passions. \t   I participated in a transformative opportunity in the spring of 2012 on a Miami University sponsored medical mission trip to Nicaragua. This experience shed light on the daily hardships of impoverishment. Contributing medical care to these individuals and seeing their gratitude towards us left me humbled. I realized I had no greater right to food, shelter, or medical attention than any one of these goodhearted individuals. I left this community with an even greater will to sacrifice, and to improve my capability to give back by providing a basic human need, compassionate medical care. I knew I had to learn more and become more practiced to succeed in this worthy undertaking.       To that end, I earned my EMT certification, learning the basics of preserving life in an emergency.  This summer I am learning other aspects of health and medical care in both my preceptorship and research position with Dr. Joseph Iannotti at the Cleveland Clinic and in my volunteer HIV intervention specialist position at the Free Clinic of Cleveland. One difficult aspect of the latter position is delivering serious news. I am finding my way through this and developing new, more compassionate communication skills in the process. In parallel with my learning, there is the personal side. My Aunts passing from the spread of pancreatic cancer, my grandmothers heart breaking deterioration due to dementia, and the special patients encountered through my experiences further my determination to make a difference.   I am driven, and have the abilities, to learn more and go further. Becoming a physician I can fulfill my lifes calling to serve in the treatment and restoration of good health through compassionate care. I look forward to partnering with my patients as we face the hardships, the rewards, the growth, and the heartbreak of health challenges together. I know it wont be easy but I am committed to act on my calling. Philanthropy Chairman- Sweeping Away ALS Philanthropy As a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity at Miami University, I was elected to the executive board as Philanthropy Chairman. Since our fraternity’s chartering in 2004, we had not established an annual philanthropic event. Philanthropy is one of the five pillars of Greek life organizations; I therefore found it disheartening that my fraternity did not have an annual event to raise money. In the fall of 2012 I decided to take the responsibility of establishing Sigma Phi Epsilon’s first annual “Sweep Away ALS” broomball tournament. With the participation of Miami’s entire Greek community, along with many other campus organizations, we were able to raise $5,000 to donate to a foundation.,  Assistant Superintendent, Adopt-a-School Tutoring Program During spring semester of 2012 I volunteered with the Adopt-A-School tutoring program at Miami University. In this program I tutored students ranging from ages eight to sixteen at local public schools in Oxford. I spent a few hours each week working individually with students in need of academic assistance. I was able to provide a fun way of learning to these kids in the subjects of Spanish and basic math. These students were thrilled to have a college student act as their mentor. Some students I encountered had not put much consideration into attending college themselves. It was my goal to not only help them with their current academics, but also explain the benefits of a college educa, Medical Fraternity Involvement I am a member of Phi Delta Epsilon, a highly selective academic fraternity composed of the 60 most qualified pre-medical students at Miami University. We are a close knit group whom share common values and aspirations of becoming physicians. I have been appointed as the New Member Education Leader, and with this position I am responsible for coordinating recruitment and interviews, introducing new members to our fraternity, organizing weekly meetings, presentations, and discussions about things such as modern medicine, applying to medical school, volunteering, holding fundraisers for Children’s Miracle Network, MCAT preparation, study groups, and hosting social events., Dean's List I have been on the dean’s list for every announced semester thus far, four in total, at Miami University. This recognizes the top 17% of students within each division of the university. I was also on the dean’s list at Colorado State University, which recognizes a student with a GPA of 3.75 or higher that semester., Undergraduate Research in Organic Chemistry I have been working with the interim chairman of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Dr. Richard Taylor, for the past year in an undergraduate research laboratory. I am part of a team of students that are working collaboratively on different methods of synthesizing a compound that will be added onto a larger neuropeptide involved in signaling for apoptosis. My research requires that I read and analyze papers, use experimental methods, and practice safe procedures. I have gained a plethora of knowledge in this laboratory regarding reactions, procedures, and how to deduce steps needed to obtain a desired product., HIV Intervention Specialist I have recently started volunteering at the Free Clinic of Cleveland as part of the Urban Leadership Internship Program through Miami University. The Free Clinic offers anonymous and confidential HIV testing to all individual. As an HIV Intervention Specialist it is my responsibility to provide pre-test counseling and education about sexually transmitted diseases and risk factors, take personal patient information, administer the test, deliver the results, and offer post-test counseling and referrals., Integrating Spanish and Healthcare in Nicaragua I was fortunate enough to be part of small group of Miami University students that traveled to Nicaragua, with a Doctor from Cincinnati and my Spanish professor, as a part of a medical mission brigade. We worked alongside Nicaraguan physicians to impoverished areas with absolutely no access to health care. The families we visited did not have any form of transportation, and lived miles away from paved roads. This made a task as simple as obtaining NSAIDs a day long venture assuming they even have the money to purchase such items. I helped set up our make-shift clinic, pick up patients, take vitals, translate for the Doctor, distribute medication, and converse with the families., Shadowing In March of 2010 I shadowed Dr. Paul Saluan, an orthopedic surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic in the Center of Sports Health. I shadowed him on two separate occasions that month, and two additional times in July 2011.  In the winter of 2013, and summer of 2013, I shadowed Dr. Joseph Iannotti, the Chairman of Orthopedics and Rheumatology at the Cleveland Clinic, for approximately 40 hours total. In the summer of 2013 I also shadowed Dr. Richard Parker, the Chairman of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, and Dr. Jonathan Mumma, a Pediatrician at Group Health Associates, for approximately 20 hours and 16 hours respectively., EMT Certification Last summer I enrolled in the EMT certification program at Tri-C in order to gain experience in the healthcare field. It was an outstanding opportunity to learn the basics of providing care for injured or ill patients in emergency situations. Along with the classroom and laboratory work for this class, I also shadowed paramedics working for private ambulatory services for 40 hours in order to gain more experience in the field. Although I have not yet worked as an EMT, it is my plan to volunteer with the Oxford fire department this coming academic year. Earning my EMT certification deepened my desire to pursuer a higher degree in the medical field, and become a phyician, Assistant Superintendent Parkview Homes is a home building company that my grandfather created in the 1960’s, and is currently managed by my father and three of my uncles. I was hired in the summer of 2012 to help my uncle with his duties as superintendent. This job required me to oversee construction site operations, contact subcontractors about scheduling dates when they would be needed on site, and complete any additional tasks in order to finalize a house before it was turned over to the buyer.,  Research Assistant, Social Fraternity Involvement Sigma Phi Epsilon Ohio Eta is a Balanced Man chapter, as such all members live to be scholars, leaders, gentlemen and athletes. We live with the values of virtue, diligence, and brotherly love. As a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, I have been appointed the Sound Mind Coordinator and the Sound Body Coordinator within the membership development committee. I earned these positions after winning their respective awards voted upon by the entire chapter for exemplifying a sound mind and sound body. As the coordinator for these programs, I tutored students in my major and assigned tutors to members in different majors. I also made exercise and nutrition plans for members wanting to get in shape., Cleveland Clinic Research Internship This summer I am interning as a research assistant under Joseph Ionnatti MD, PhD, Chairman, Orthopaedic and Rheumatologic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Iannotti is Co-Director of the Orthopaedic Research Center and has a joint appointment in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. I am currently in the second week of my 12 week internship, and I am working on completing an IRB approved registry of shoulder anthroplasty surgeries performed at the Cleveland Clinic to be utilized in future projects. I will be assisting in a current project of Dr. Iannotti’s research team once I am granted access to all Cleveland Clinic databases."

    "text": "It's hard to pinpoint the moment when I decided to become a doctor. There was no epiphany, but rather a long and uneven path that seemed to be leading me in an altogether different direction for much of my life. I grew up with medicine. My father, now a craniomaxillofacial surgeon, first trained as a dentist and then earned his M.D. while I was in grade school. I have three other doctors in my family: my paternal grandfather and a pair of uncles. As a high school student, I excelled in the sciences, and it seemed only natural to me that I would go on to study medicine myself.   When I got to college, things became more complicated. Straight away I was exposed, second-hand, to all sorts of topics and career-paths that I had never encountered in high school. Most of my friends were off exploring unfamiliar territoryanthropology, philosophy, neuroscience, literary studies, political science, public healthand I seemed to be repeating the same subjects I had taken in high school. Sure, we encountered some new topics in my college general chemistry course, but so much was mere review. Weren't these supposed to be the most intellectually rewarding years of my life And here I was: relearning my solubility rules, losing interest, and feeling more and more like I was falling behind my peers. Soon enough I would start applying to medical schools and it would all be over. I would be on to the next thing, never having strayed from my predestined, perfectly-manicured path (the grounds at Washington University are beautifully maintained). I worried that I would end up a doctor by default when my real calling was in journalism or geology or some field I hadn't even heard of yet.  Before long I was second-guessing every decision I made, and it was only a matter of time before I manufactured the crisis that I had been praying for. My grades dropped precipitously and I decided, finally, to abandon the premedical track and explore other avenues of study. Around this time my health declined and I received a number of troubling somatic diagnoses that only served to compound the feelings of doubt and uneasiness that I already had about my future.  It wasn't all bad, though, my new life as an English literature major provided me a fantastic change of pace. In what few semesters remained to me I tried to cast a wide net: Milton and the Bible in the morning, postcolonial and postmodern thinkers in the afternoon, and evenings of dinner table debates that saw my friends and I roaring points and counterpoints through mouthfuls of food. Writing had its own rewards. After days spent rummaging through books and loose notes, gradually pounding and kneading an argument into shape, I could never keep myself from grinning ear-to-ear when I went to collect my still-warm stack of papers from the library printer. After graduation I was lucky enough to find a job on the other side of the world where I had no friends or family. Starting over in Switzerland felt like a new beginning. At the AO Foundation I worked with educational experts, scientists and physicians to develop materials for continuing medical education. I had hoped that coming at medicine from a different angle would give me a chance to test the waters, to see if any of my initial enthusiasm for that career path had survived. At the end of December we all worked frantically to put on our largest course of the year. During breaks I listened to expert lecturers and watched junior surgeons at their practical exercise tables.  Sitting in one dim lecture hall, I was suddenly reminded of the slides I had seen on my father's home projector screen almost twenty years prior. And just as before, I riveted by what I saw: destroyed human faces being painstakingly put back together. Faces marred by trauma, by cancer, by congenital deformityeach in turn flashed across the screen. The doctors in the audience nodded their heads silently. Without surgery, these patients would have been condemned to a severe, lifelong handicap, many wouldn't have survived at all. I imagined myself, as I hadn't in many years, looking down on the patient from behind a surgical mask. I knew that I could be a doctor, a good one even, and that I wouldn't waver in my determination again. Since then, my resolve has only grown stronger. I find myself more motivated and purposive than I have ever been. I want to empower myself to change people's lives for the better, and I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to achieve that goal.  Over the past few months I have tried to get as much exposure to medicine as possible. In preparing for the MCAT, I brought my new sense of purpose to bear on the topics that had caused me so much grief in college. I found that I once again enjoyed biology, chemistry, and physics as I had in high school. In June I sat enrolled in a couple of biology classes on a post-baccalaureate basis. I have also had the chance to shadow a number of physicians at a local hospital, where I have observed procedures ranging from total-joint-replacements to angioplasties. In a few days I will join the class of 2014 in the University of Cincinnatis MS in Physiology Program, where we will take classes alongside first year medical students. I cannot wait to begin. Scarsdale Volunteer Ambulance Corps As a CPR-certified volunteer it was my duty to perform rig checks during which I made sure that all ambulances were in working order and were properly equipped to provide advanced life support. I rode along on emergency calls in support of on-duty paramedics and EMTs. I had originally planned to complete EMT-B training but this proved to be incompatible with my summer course schedule, which meant that I could only volunteer in a very limited capacity. Still, I was grateful for the chance to learn about EMS. It had always seemed to me that my suburban town lacked real communal institutions, but I now realize that I just wasn't looking hard enough. I wish I had discovered SVAC sooner., Dean's List Fall 2007 Freshman, Beth Israel Medical Center (Shadowing) I shadowed two physicians at Beth Israel hospital. Dr. Donald Kastenbaum and his surgical team allowed me to observe their work in the operating room. On more than one occasion, I witnessed several total joint replacements of both the knee and hip after which Dr. Kastenbaum answered my questions and invited me to observe with the surgeons in adjacent suites. Accordingly, I watched various procedures in the departments of otolaryngology and vascular surgery. I also shadowed with Dr. Carl Greenberg, an anesthesiologist, for a number of surgeries, including pre-surgical assessment and immediate aftercare., New York Athletic Club, Travers Island I was assigned to the club's tennis facilities where my duties included court-cleaning and general maintenance. At times I worked in the tennis pro shop, ringing up purchases and handling member services inquiries. This was my first experience in customer service; it made me a better listener and a more patient person., Beth Israel Medical Center (Volunteer Services) My volunteer service at Beth Israel consisted mostly of clerical work. At the nursing station I kept patient charts organized, answered phone calls, and responded to patient requests. I tried to make myself useful to the nurses by running orders to and from the pharmacy or retrieving equipment from storage rooms. On a few occasions I helped with the food service. I kept company those patients who wanted someone to talk to. Though I was happy to volunteer my time, I was often frustrated with myself for not being able to do more for the patients and the people caring for them., AO Foundation Internship The AO Foundation is a nonprofit devoted to the study and treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. I completed a seven month internship, dividing my time equally between the educational institute and clinical divisions. Moving between departments forced me to learn how juggle several assignments simultaneously. My duties ranged from the coordination of the launch of a new web portal to the development of educational programming and distance-learning materials. Through my internship I learned a great deal about continuing medical education and the potential for continuous learning and specialization in a physician's career. I achieved some basic competence in German through independent study., Environmental Defense Fund Internship The EDF is a nonprofit environmental advocacy group. As an intern, it was my job to read through scientific literature, newspaper articles, and all manner of pertinent documents in order to distill the contents down into readable briefs for my coworkers (e.g. one assignment called for a paper on the emissions profile of combustion turbine technologies). The diversity of expertise on display at EDF was both inspiring and intimidating. Working with scientists and lawyers could make me feel inadequate at times. As in medicine, the stakes were high and much was expected of everyone involved, and in that respect it was extremely gratifying work. Still, I wanted for a professional niche., Thyroid, Head and Neck Cancer Foundation The THANC Foundation supports ongoing research in the areas of thyroid, head, and neck cancer. It also provides community outreach and patient support, as well as educational opportunities for medical professionals. I served as a student volunteer at THANC as part of my high school Senior Options Program. My work in fund-raising activities included building relationships with donors and the planning of special events. I was also responsible for maintenance of the foundation website where I posted news and photos to keep the community informed of our activities. I learned about a whole constellation of patient-support roles that I had not yet considered or appreciated., Laboratory of Blood and Vascular Biology When I was a rising high school senior, I volunteered as a summer research assistant in a laboratory dedicated to the study of vascular molecular biology. I worked under a research fellow, R. Blue, investigating the mechanism platelet aggregation. Over 200 small molecules were tested for their ability to interrupt binding between platelets and fibrinogen molecules via inhibition of aIIbß3 integrin. I assisted in the preparation of various solutions, the screening and analysis of the tested compounds, as well as data collection and processing. My time at Rockefeller gave me a better idea of how researchers and physicians can design experiments to develop novel therapies."

    "text": "My eyes scanned the maze of wires that covered the surface of a robot I had spent the past three months helping to build. I was a senior in high school, a leader on the robotics team and had spent countless hours creating this machine that was now malfunctioning. I knew where every wire led, where every bolt was located and, most importantly, how to recognize errors. All it took was one loose connection to bring the entire robot to a screeching halt. We were in a competition and only had a short time to diagnose the problem, make the necessary changes and get the robot back on the field. My previous experience enabled me to quickly recognize the symptoms, locate the point of failure and fix the problem. All the knowledge I had been building led up to that moment and nothing could have felt better than executing the fix successfully. It was at this point that I realized what I am passionate about: I want to learn how things work so that I can fix or improve them. As a member of the robotics club my teachers naturally recommended engineering as a profession through which I could exploit this passion.  As an undergraduate, I excitedly absorbed as much knowledge as possible; I wanted to know how everything worked. Studying was not the chore that many of my peers viewed it as, for me it was an opportunity to learn about the world around me. As a biomedical engineering student my curriculum had a healthy balance of science, math and engineering. Although I enjoyed my engineering and math classes I quickly realized that biology was what really interested me.  I came to the conclusion that the human body is the most complicated machine to ever exist; all I wanted to do was learn more about it. I wanted to know how the brain was able to cause muscle movement, why diabetics needed to take insulin and what caused cells to become cancerous. My love of learning is one of the reasons that I began to consider a future in medicine. I want to explore every corner of the body and discover how it is able to function.  My interest in the human body led me to apply for an internship with BioMet, an engineering company focused on the creation of joint replacements. Part of the interview process involved a day spent shadowing the engineers. As I toured the facility I slowly began to realize that this was not what I wanted to devote my life to. I have always been a very social person and love interacting with other people. In fact, I think that my ability to relate with others is one of my greatest strengths. When I looked around I saw the engineers silently working on their computers, barely interacting with each other, not to mention their customers. I realized that the lack of social interaction would not only be boring, but would lead to a waste of one of my greatest natural talents. While this realization effectively removed the idea of engineering from my future, it brought into focus that what I really wanted was to become a doctor.  Despite my public declaration of the path that I wanted to take, I was still not entirely convinced that medicine was the right fit for me. Therefore, I decided to volunteer at a hospital to get more exposure. One day in the clinic, a nurse asked me to deliver a beverage to a patient. When I entered the patients bay she quietly expressed that, having just come out of surgery, she was now in a tremendous amount of pain. I froze; I had no idea what to say to her. I wanted to tell her that everything would be fine, but I had no idea if that was true and didnt want to create a false sense of hope. I didnt possess the knowledge or experience to ease her pain. I wanted to fix her just as I had fixed the robot so many years ago. However, it struck me that this woman was nothing like the robot. It wasnt that I simply wanted to fix the problem, it was more than that, I wanted to help her. Healing her would lead to a personal fulfillment that I could never have achieved by fixing a gear on a motor. As I was leaving her bedside a doctor approached and began asking her various questions about the pain. At that moment all my doubts were resolved, I wanted to know what he knew and I wanted to use that knowledge to help her.  I have met many students who claimed that they always knew they wanted to be a doctor. I cannot say the same. My road to medical school has been long but at the end of the day the trip was worth it. Along the way I have discovered a lot about myself: what interests me, what is important to me and what fulfills me. These discoveries have unanimously confirmed my inspiration to become a doctor. Interestingly, I realized that many of the traits that led me toward the field of medicine are the same traits that could help me to become a successful physician. My passion for learning and interest in the subject will help me be a successful medical student and eventual physician.  My love of social interaction will allow me to connect with patients and engage them in understanding the problems they are facing. Lastly, my need to fix what is broken, combined with my eagerness to help people, will give me the enthusiasm and passion necessary to be truly successful in both a career in medicine as well as in life. Intramural Softball A group of friends and I began an intramural softball team during the spring of 2011 and 2012. It was a great way to hang out with friends outside of the classroom. While we were not the most competitive team, we had a lot of fun and made it to the play-off games both years. I enjoyed teaching the less experienced players the basics of the game and practicing with the team. Unfortunately, the season moved to the fall during my senior year, so we were unable to play during the spring as we had planned., Eagle Scout A major part of achieving the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts is the completion of an independent service project.  My project involved the installation of over 20 permanent in-ground bike racks throughout my community.  The project taught me valuable leadership and project management skills.  In addition to the project, my time in the Boy Scouts taught me the importance of spending time outdoors.  Although I am no longer active in the Boy Scouts, I still take time to go backpacking at least once a year and I try to go hiking or rock climbing whenever I get the chance., Volunteer at James Cancer Hospital At the beginning of my junior year I began volunteering weekly at the Ohio State James Cancer Hospital.  I volunteered in a variety of positions and undertook various jobs.  One such position was in the Ear, Nose, and Throat Clinic where I was primarily responsible for taking patients from the waiting room to their examination room. I also volunteered in the Ambulatory Surgery Unit where I helped prepare patient bays, getting post-operative patients snacks and escorting family members to the waiting area.  Most recently, I have been taking the movie cart from room to room.  This involves going into patient rooms and offering them DVD’s that they can check out., Development of Assistive Device During my senior year I was involved in a Capstone design class where teams of students were responsible for designing and creating a prototype of an assistive device.  Over the course of the year my group produced what we think is a great device.  We are confident that our device is capable of improving the clinical experience of patients as they are fitted for wheelchairs.  Upon receiving positive feedback from clinicians who tested the device, the group has decided to push forward with the project outside of class.  Several of the group members, including myself, are now attempting to patent the device and are working with local clinicians so that the device can be improved., Undergraduate Research Internship with Dr.Hart For two summers I worked as a paid intern in Dr. Rich Hart’s Biomedical Engineering lab.  Although I worked on multiple small scale projects, my primary job was to design and create a chamber that would aid in experiments.  This involved designing models in a CAD program followed by actually creating prototypes in a machine shop.  While I was able to create multiple semi-functional models, my work revealed that the project was likely beyond the scale of what could be accomplished with the machines available to us.  This experience helped me develop project management skills and also engendered my ability to work independently., Runner & Triathlete I completed a triathlon in the spring of 2012 and a half marathon in the spring of 2013.  It is important for me to fit exercise into my schedule.  I try to exercise at least three or four days a week-whether it’s running, swimming, biking or playing tennis (a sport I recently picked up).  Although I like participating in the races, I primarily enjoy my casual weekday workouts which help me relax and unwind., Patient Data Entry Position I spent two summers working 40 hours a week in an orthopedic surgeon’s office.  I was responsible for entering patient information into the electronic medical records system. I received a lot of exposure to the inner workings of a medical practice.  In addition, I came to realize the high level of commitment put forth by the physicians who were often the first ones in and the last ones out of the office., Undergraduate Research Volunteer with Dr.Hund I worked in Dr. Thomas Hund’s lab that focused on excitable cells, specifically cardiomyocytes, for one semester in an independent study/research volunteer position.   The lab I was primarily responsible for genotyping the mice which were used in many of the experiments.  This included taking tail clippings from the animals and running PCR on the biological sample.  This was very different from the previous research position I had held with Dr. Rich Hart, which was primarily engineering.  It was nice to experience a different type of research and have a more medically and biologically focused lab experience.,  Research Assistant, Physician Shadowing The following are the doctors that I shadowed.  Cardiothoracic Surgery: Dr. Bryan Whitson (6 Hours, Spring 2013)  Pediatric Surgery: Dr. Gail Besner (16 Hours, Summer 2013) Dr. Denis King (8 Hours, Spring 2013)  Orthopedic Surgery: Dr. Keith Berend (10 Hours, Summer 2010) Dr. Adolph Lombardi (10 Hours, Summer 2010)  Neonatology: Dr. Kristina Reber (7 Hours, Spring 2013)"
