**PROBLEM:**

This problem came about as part of a project of evaluting the quality of care at urgent care centers in Ohio based on user reviews. In order to get a list of every urgent care center in Ohio, I needed a complete list of cities in Ohio. One website gave such a list (https://www.ohio-demographics.com/cities_by_population), but there were various problems such as city nicknames being used and multiple cities being lumped together in one. 

**OUTCOME:**

A cleaned dataframe with one city per row.
