PROBLEM:

Our research questions for this project was, what are the biggest factors influencing Blue Bike trip duration in general,
and what are the biggest weather-related factors influencing Blue Bike trip duration. Weather data and ride share data
are both spanning the time from the beginning of November 2021 to the end of November 2021, in Boston, MA.

OUTCOME:

We correlated bike-share trips to their nearest Weather Underground weather station.

We determined that whether or not a user was a subscriber or not was one of the biggest determining factors
of trip duration. This intuitively made sense to us; if a user is a subscriber they won't worry about
the cost in their choice to make a trip, so they'll make more casual, shorter trips. If a user isn't
a subscriber, they'll worry about the cost of an individual trip and only take a trip if it's going to be worth the money.

We found that average humidity was one of the most significant weather-related features. We found evidence to believe 
that once average humdity goes above 65, there will be increased trip durations for Blue Bike trips in the month of November in the city of Boston.
