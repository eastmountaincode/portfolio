**PROBLEM:**

I want to release a song in an alternative way to putting it on Bandcamp or Spotify, and I wanted to work on a project
to help me learn how to make draggable objects on a webpage.

**OUTCOME:**

I asked my friend, illustrator Charlie Patterson, to create some animated grass gifs. Users of the website were meant to drag the 
grass gifs away to discover an audio player with my new song.

Some people even got creative...
