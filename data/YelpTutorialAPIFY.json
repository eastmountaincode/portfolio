Streetpops takes a unique perspective on the average popsicle and twists it into an amazing concoction. \n\nThey feature a variety of flavors at given times like orange cream, lemon lavender, and chocolate sea salt. You can tell that every flavor is thought out and creative. These are a sweet treat for any day and for anyone. \n\nOne thing I will say is that it can get a little pricy for families. I still think it's worth the trip but just walk in knowing that the popsicles are not your typical. \n \nEveryone is always super nice and informative about true flavors that are currently being featured. If you want an alternative to the typical ice cream treat...make sure to give them a try.",

This ice cream shop has so much potential but could use some work to make it a welcoming environment. When we stepped up to the counter, we were informed of how many of the flavors that they were out of (which was quite a few). It was a busy day, so I can forgive that. What really alarmed me was the poor attitude of the staff. Our interaction with the staff was short and cold. Given that this is a family-friendly environment, it feels like the vibes should be a lot warmer and friendlier.\n\nThe Rookwood Ice Cream Parlor has lots of potential. The environment is SUPER cool, but also needs to be well-kept. The parlor was kept in poor shape and the floor desperately needed to be swept and mopped. Maybe we just caught them after a rush of business and saw it at the wrong hour. The ice cream was delicious, of course, and I would definitely come back to bring someone to this super cool environment. This Ice Cream Parlor is such a great asset to the museum, and I would love to see it step up its game to wow visitors and locals alike.",

I was having a busy day of work projects on two different sides of town Having received the @UDF #u-drive email I really wanted to pick up the the Wednesday freebie at a UDF location convenient to my route from the eastside to the westside of town.This location seemed to be the best for that. Following my Google map directions I easily found this UDF store which is easily noticable as you approach the intersection.  I was immediately surprised by the large exterior lot and the large number of gas pumps on it. Also the price for regular was very reasonable and I had #u-drive points to use which were decreasing every month that I held on to them. Most of the points had come from buying their delicious @UDF malts. The first thing I did was park in front of the store to go in and get the freebie. Customers were leaving the counter as I approached  it. The two employees greeted me. I asked them where to find the chocolatey treat. Turns out it was right in front of me on a super convenient display. I was quickly & easily checked out using the  #u-drive app and then headed to my car. Next I drove over to a nearby gas pump. The payment transaction went very fast so I was soon done filling up my tank. I will gladly return to this location. The exterior lot and the store were very clean. The employees were friendly. My freebie chocolate snack was delicious! Until next time be kind to each other. @udf #u-drivefreebie @yelpcincy #wednesday #cincyeastside",

Many, if not all, have ice cream counters where a delicious shake or cone can be had from fresh UDF product. More commonly, customers interact with their petroleum services for refueling or the coffee and snacks from the convenience store.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this location has almost become a flagship like store for UDF who is still locally based in Norwood. In 2012, this location was shut down for a bit of time and completely overhauled with a refurbished store, new lot, parking and pumps. The results are a very nice corner station that is well maintained and relatively easy to access despite the odd 5 way stop.  \n\nThe UDF has snacks, drinks, gas and brewskis as one would expect. The secret of this and a few other UDF locations in the area is that they often have significantly better prices on gas than competing locations just yards away. If you're in the area, they're always worth checking for a fill up.\n\nHaving the nicest neighborhood gas station should not be a difficult feat to achieve, but so few seem to really care. UDF has invested in improving their local facilities and have delivered a nice upgrade to a neighborhood stable.",

It was so fun to watch your ice cream be created and the staff were friendly, creating an overall inviting atmosphere.\n\nI ordered the Brownie Bash and it was absolutely DELICIOUS. Creamy, loaded with delicious toppings and filling! Each bite contained brownie morsels, chocolate chips, delicious fudge-like chocolate syrup and scrumptious caramel sauce. It's a combo made in heaven and perfect for any chocolate lover.\n\nI will definitely be back to try a different flavor. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a picturesque delicious ice cream creation! They are located in Findlay Market in a stand outside on the weekends. Definitely don't miss out and order yourself a yummy treat! \n\nThe only con is I wish it was cheaper, but maybe this is a good thing since this will prevent me from ordering a treat every weekend ha.",

Deliciously cream and not overly sweet. \nI went in June 2018 and was lucky enough to have caught them, we came on a Friday in July and no such luck. Very sad to have missed them as we don't often come to Cincinnati. \nThat being said, every trip we make, we will always have time to find Lenny's. Absolutely the best! We've tried several places before and this just rolled to the top. I had the cookies and cream. The layer of fudge in the roll just made this so much better. This is how you do ice cream!!!\n\nHow do I know they're the best?! Because I enjoy ice cream as much or more as our last VP Joe Biden. Ice cream is life. Have you ever seen Biden with an ice cream cone? No? Look it up, it's a thing of beauty. Anyway, you must stop by and try this place!! Well worth the 2+ hour drive!!",

The concept is awesome, because they make your ice cream to order, so you get to watch. But, more than that, they way it's laid out and then rolled up, means you get a layer of toppings evenly distributed throughout each roll!! It's brilliant. It does taste a little different from regular store-bought ice cream, though, as it is made on the spot with heavy cream (as opposed to milk and various chemicals in store-bought). This means you get a little fatty/oily mouthfeel for a while after you eat it. But, on a super hot day, it's totally worth it!!",

When you walk into the store, Eduardo, the owner and artisan, is quick to make you feel at home and help you choose sampling the many types of cheeses he makes right there in the store. All of his cheeses are freshly made; and when I say fresh, I mean fresh. Just made a few days ago.  You can even watch how the cheese is made.  Not only fresh cheese, you can also get Harina PAN (corn flour) so you can make delicious fresh cheese-stuffed arepas. It's truly a Latin American flavor made in Cincinnati. \n\nI would strongly recommend you visit the store and get a sample of products, and if you're preparing a party or any type of gathering, Eduardo sets you up with a wonderful variety of products to delight your guests.",

The soft serve is creamy and delicious and my personal favorite, the Reese's Cup Flurry made with chocolate ice cream is the stuff dreams are made of. The serving size is generous and there is just enough soft serve to bind the big chunks of fresh peanut butter cup together.  It's probably a good thing they close for the winter!!  The service is always prompt and friendly too.",

They also offer lots of other frozen treats like milkshakes, flurries, slushies, and banana splits.  They also have recently brought out a \"Blue Ice Cream,\" which is a dupe for the King's Island's Smurf Ice Cream.\n\nA little additional info: they are CASH ONLY.  Also, as far as I have seen they are pet friendly since it is a walk up stand.  Along with being a walk-up stand they are only open seasonally.  They usually open sometime in March or later and seem to close around September.  There is a drive thru, but the lines can get long and don't go very fast.  It is a pretty busy area of that street and it is also next to a funeral home, so if there is a service there can be more traffic in the parking lot, which is something to keep in mind if you are bringing rambunctious little ones.",

Healthy Dairy Bar comes into the conversation. \n\nI grew up frequenting this stand situated on the bustling Hamilton Avenue. The surrounding businesses aren't what one would call welcoming, but somehow it works. From its standard ice cream cones to flurries, shakes, blizzards and dip tops, there are more than enough options to satisfy even the most discerning ice cream connoisseur. The Dairy Bar even recently started making and selling a Blueberry/Blue Raspberry soft serve that is reminiscent of the famous Smurf ice cream from Kings Island. And, well, if you're not in the mood to pay a $40 entry to KI, the Dairy Bar is a fantastic alternative.\n\nWhile the ice cream selection may be expansive enough, there are also plenty of food items as well for a quick bite before indulging in a sweet treat finale.\n\nI typically opt for either a small chocolate/vanilla swirl cone with chocolate sprinkles or a chocolate milkshake made with chocolate/vanilla swirl ice cream. I recently ordered the latter and, boy, I may never get the former again. The milkshake was outstanding. In fact, I'm craving one now. And if the Dairy Bar can bring me to crave ice cream, it has to be great.",

Flavor and texture were the quality one expects from Graeters.  My banana split made with salted caramel ice cream, coffee ice cream, butterscotch, hot fudge, and pecans was delicious.  I would go so far as to say the best split or Sundae I have ever had. My son asked for two cherries on top, and they gave him three. Those are the little things that make Graeters  (and this location,) so much better than the competition. \n\nEmployees were all smiles. Sophie was particularly memorable.  She was helpful in making choice, didn't rush us, and made beautifully full sundaes. No skimping on the kid's sundaes just because they are children.  She was attentive to us, and helped other employees.",

This is such a great cause and I suggest you come to a Graeter's location of your choosing to support it every September. I Prefer not having my scoop of ice cream in a cone and always get it in a cup where there is plenty of room for a second scoop. This day was no exception. I had the Cone for a cure flavor of Elena's Blueberry Pie with pieces of pie crust in it. The flavor is rich and the texture is creamy. It is very good for not having any chocolate in it. My second scoop was the s'more ice cream. This is one of my favorites although I think it is only a promotional flavor. For a $5 donation you could get a coupon book. I was happy to do this!                  There was a problem with how much I was charged though. My extra scoop was priced as a regular kid's cup at $3.50 not as an additional scoop at $1.25. When I asked the manager she confirmed that charging me for kid's cup was correct. However at other locations in past years this was not the case. I will not be returning to this Graeter's location in future if the choice is mine. Instead I will be going to other locations to get my Graeter's fix. Nor I can I recommend this location for any other free scoop day like National Ice Cream day! Until next time be kind to each other. #yelpcincy #graetersicecream",

My go-to flavor is none other than their Kitty Kitty Bang Bang. Though it is listed as an ice cream flavor, they were more than happy to make it into a milkshake for me. It consists of smooth cheesecake-flavored ice cream with a sweet raspberry ripple. To top it all of off, there are also bits of Oreo cookies and a mix of some chocolate chunks. If you have a sweet tooth, you will surely not be disappointed. I always make a point to stop by whenever I'm in the area.",

My husband's candy apple pie shake was unbelievable. He said it was the best shake he ever had. My son sticks to cotton candy and my daughter loves the lemon meringue. I enjoy the waffle cones which are very fresh. The only downside to this place is that my kids will be begging to walk here after school in 2 years when they are in middle school. I do admit, I'm a bit jealous as I only had the pastry shop and the corner store when I was coming up in Wyoming. I knocked down a star for the price but that won't stop us from partaking.

Lots of opptions for grabbing a quick present if one forgot to pick one up, and is also picking up a cake. \n\nThe ice cream was everything one expects from Graeter's. Not too sweet, creamy, bold flavors that delight the tastebuds. Lots of ice cream flavors to choose from. Along with the traditional French pot ice cream there is gelato, and sorbet.  Cone selections even include a pretzel cone. The bakery side was filled with scrumptious looking pastries and cakes. \n\nTo top it off, this location has a drive up window.

      "text": "I did something I literally have only done four times while living in Cincinnati for ten years now. I went to the west side. My least favorite side. \n\nI was sent a photo of creamy whip from this place and started reading about it. Decided to go as soon as it opened that day to hopefully have to have minimum human interaction.  \n\nMy plan worked and my boyfriend and I were the only two people there our a whole game until we were done and a small family came right then. \n\nWhen we got there a boy was working by himself and trying to get stuff ready for the day but he didn't act annoyed at all that we were already there. He was helpful on what course he prefers and nice. We ended up doing the 18 holes. Which was long enough for me in 94 degree weather at 11 in the morning. \n\nThis place is very old school Americana style of putt putt. Everything is very self made and cartoon characters around the courses are crazy. They've obviously seen some stuff in their day; seeing how most of them are falling apart. \n\nBecause they're falling apart we had a couple malfunctions with them when playing. The hole that had a giant rock looking thing on it, the foam was falling out of the bottom of the rock and my ball got stuck in it so we had to fish it out. \n\nAlso, the hole with the T-Rex, it's hard to even hit the ball into the hole because you can't get under the dinosaur to hit it in. Then when you hit it in you have to get on your knees and crawl under it to get your balls out. \n\nThe Putt Putt place was decent. I enjoyed it and that's what is important. I would drop $14 on it to do it again at some point. \n\nWe got Creamy Whip afterwards and the woman working the window was super nice and helpful. We both got \"Dreams Cones\". My boyfriend got the one dipped in hot fudge with nuts. I got the one dipped in hot fudge with rainbow sprinkles. Both were amazing. \n\nThey had a pretty big menu and it was decently overwhelming when we got up to it. So I'm glad the lady working was so helpful. \n\nThey have lots of outdoor picnic tables and seating but we just sat in the car in the AC because we were melting. \n\nWhen Covid isn't a thing, they apparently have a game room and a  Bungee jump thing for kids. \n\nMy only real problems I had with this place are the course pieces are falling apart and my major thing is that they have a giant \"Blue Lives Matter\" flag on their course. Which grossed me out and was a big \"What am I looking at on this Putt Putt course?\"\n\nBut also, not surprised coming from a place named after a guy who murdered a bunch of Native Americans. Ya know? \n\nI just want to play putt putt be taken away from reality for a minute.\n\nIf you're stir crazy and need go get out of the house but don't want to be around a crowd of people. Or if you just want some good creamy whip, hit this place up.",

The soft serve prices are relatively expensive ($2.40 for a small dish) but they have a few unique flavor options. In the machine they have chocolate, vanilla, Dole lime and the infamous \"King's Island\" blue raspberry. You can also get ~35 other flavors as a mix-in (+$.60).\n\nI had the KI-clone blue raspberry, and have to say: it's not exactly a good rip-off of King's Island. It looked a bit too anæmic (pale blue). I was also disappointed to see a bit more of the historic exterior chipped away this season (RIP vintage neon General Chester's sign, my sweet prince). I mostly come here FOR the nostalgia, so once it's all gone I suppose I will be too.",

It is on par with other DQ stops- a little nostalgia for the way back whens, a touch of \"this must be your first job, kiddo,\" and a healthy dose of yaaaaas that tastes just like I remember! The service is solid, if young, but they are training them well at this location. It is a popular spot for sure and they manage to churn out the orders at a pretty quick pace. During the pandemic times, I have seen all of the employees wearing masks. It gets a little dicey when you are ordering at the walk up window-the general public is less inclined to follow the \"Stand Here\" circles and masks seem to be few and far between. So even though it is faster, you may want to wait in the drive thru line to avoid the gaggle of possibly diseased teenagers who are more unconsciously thoughtless than purposefully invasive. Still, it is more sweet than salty and worth the occasional trip. And if you find the non peak hours, do let me know.",

They also have a drive thru which comes in handy when it's a little more chilly out in the unpredictable Cincinnati weather.",

I love how convenient it is to my house, that I can walk down there when it's nice out. The service is always great. One thing that is pretty slow though is the drive thru. I go up to the window now. One suggestion would be to make the parking lot bigger because cars can't drive past the people in the drive thru line, which causes a traffic jam and cars ending up on the busy Springfield Pike. Will definitely be back!",

The people who work here are always super friendly and nice. \n\nThis UDF has the norms, like their amazing ice cream and candy. Sodas and water. But they also have a \"Reading\" area full of books. \n\nThey have a big selection of wine and craft beer. Great selection of both. The craft beer selection is always what has me in amazement. They have all the local beers like Rhineguiest, Madtree, and Braxton. But they also have other rarer craft beer like Fat Head and Tank 7, Belle's. One that you wouldn't find in most convenient stores or gas stations. \n\nThey also have a bakery/sandwich area. The sandwiches actually look pretty awesome. Every time I'm in here I see people getting these sandwiches. I have yet to get one myself. \n\nIf you'rein Mount Adams and need some amazing ice cream or some craft beer for take out, I would defiantly stop by in here.",

I waited in the car while my husband  ran in he came out shortly after because he realized he left his wallet at home. So I went in to pay for it and the clerk refused to sell it to me unless I showed her both our IDs. Mind you we are both in our 30s and we have visited this store many times. I then said I would go back to the shelf and pick up a different bottle of wine and she refused to sell me any alcohol unless we could show his ID. Not only was she unreasonable she went about this in a very nasty unpleasant manner. \n\nWhoever owns/manages this store you should train your staff to have better manners.

Perhaps it is because it is in the most posh neighborhood in Cincinnati!\n\nUDF is probably one of the only places where you can get a tank of gas, get some cigarettes and beer, and maybe an ice cream cone if you're in the mood! It truly is a novelty. However, this location doesn't have any gas pumps so you'll have to settle for the other fun activities.\n\nI enjoy this location more than others for many reasons. The first is their patio is so enjoyable to sit and eat ice cream. It's in such a pretty location and is well shaded by near-by trees. The inside of the store is very well laid out. They have a great magazine selection here. I've also seen more fresh fruits and lunch options at this location than any other!\n\nIf you haven't been to a UDF yet, it's an experience that can't be missed!",

They also have a lot of great ice cream flavors my favorite is the buckeye flavor which is chocolate and peanut butter yum! I also had a good mocha flavored ice cream as well. My dads favorite is the bourbon peacan. They really do have a flavor for everyone! \n\nI will definitely be back next time I'm in the area.",

The pricing is way too high for what you get - Not to mention the $0.50 upcharge for any credit purchase, regardless of overall spent. I have walked away from this place upset every time I've attempted to buy ice cream here in the past two years. The oreo flurry I ordered was basically a large cup of soft serve with a few crumbs sprinkled on top. Whenever attempting to order a Sundae or cone go-to, we've been massively shorted on ice cream. Last night the waffle cone I ordered contained about half the ice cream I would expect, as the girls barely filled the cone since I asked for it \"flipped\" to easily take in the car. When they also forgot the jimmies, I mentioned it was told \"That's  $0.75 extra.\" I said forget it and they hastily handed me a large cup full of jimmies (Which spilled all over my seat on the way home - that was fun to clean up.) \n\nSave your money, go to McDonald's for soft serve or a flurry - it tastes the same as what they're selling. Or better yet - take that $8 to the grocery and buy enough ice cream for days.",

They have homemade whip cream and peanut butter dipped cones.\n\nI had to try the lavender milkshake. I asked what it tasted like. She said \"lavender.\" Now I know - and that fun summer flavor does not disappoint. It felt lighter and refreshing than the candy bar creations you typically find. Try lavender!\n\nNext time we are going to try the Bold Face Cone, but they sold out of the gold leaves for the cone the night before.",

The ice cream is very creamy - they told us it's cause of the high percent of fat in the dairy which is why it tastes so much better than your normal soft serve ice cream. They give cups, cones and even can do dips with the cones! They have a really cute seating area right outdoor to the window that you place orders.

It was like a dairy delight from a fairy tale fit for a prince(ss)! *drops voice down an octave* Joking aside, Bold Face is easily my new favorite ice cream bar. They have vegan and gluten-free homemade popsicles (pomegranate, strawberry lemonade today) and a variety of soft serve mix-ins. Notable are cardamom, pistachio and lavender flavors. They have a specialty shake/malt with bourbon too! (it's flavoring and non-alcoholic). \n\nNot only do they have very reasonable prices ($1 kids servings) and hipster offerings, the location is really unique. It's in the same building as BLOC so you can also feed your coffee addiction in one trip. The building has some cool architectural character (it's the old Mason Lodge) and while you cannot go inside there's a patio with outdoor seating. Caveat: there's only one shaded area and the seating is covered in mirror-like metal which will remind you of burning your legs on playground equipment as a child. \n\nUrban exploration idea: come to Price Hill, check out Bold Face and BLOC and swing over for a panoramic view of Cincinnati from Olden View Park! Your Instagram followers will thank you...",

      "text": "A very interesting unique concept! You order through a window and they have two flavors of soft serve vanilla and chocolate and then you can do a twist or add flavors to them and/or toppings! I would have given them a five star but we had to wait a little longer for our order as their vanilla machine was acting up. It's located right down the street from the Incline Public House so we enjoyed an excellent meal there and then we went to The Bold Face Dairy Bar for tasty dessert! They have a very large outdoor area to eat in with lots of picnic table seating. We tried the vanilla soft serve ice cream with the pistachio flavor, bourbon barrel stout flavor and the lavender flavor and they were all delicious! The lavender was amazing and it was our overall family favorite! The bourbon barrel stout in my opinion needed more of a stronger flavoring as I really could not identify that flavor and I enjoy bourbon barrel stout beer. The pistachio was a delicious choice also!",

I was walking down the street to my car and I noticed a small window -- I saw ice cream and could not resist on a 94 degree day.  I ordered a small Reeses Peanut Butter Cup Flurrie and was not disappointed. It was basically like a McDonald's McFlurry but SOOOOOO much better. The ice cream was absolutely fresh, creamy, and delicious and the peanut butter cups only made it that much better. I am so glad I found this adorable spot! I do wish they had more signage around though so that more people would know it is there. I had no idea I was missing out on this local ice cream joint!",

The Key Lime Pie was delicious, light, and refreshing. The Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip is what they're known for, and after trying it I can understand why. The flavor is spot on, and the chocolate pieces melt in your mouth! I also tried the Chunky Chunky Hippo. Although the name sounds funny, they did not mess around with this one. It was my favorite with vanilla ice cream, peanuts, caramel, and pieces of chocolate truffle. \n\nThey also offer donuts, chocolates, candy, coffee, and ice cream pints to-go. You can even use them to cater an event! A fellow customer told me about an ice cream sundae bar they set up. They had tons of flavors delivered on ice with toppings on the side to build your own sundae. Not a bad idea!",

I've admired this treat from afar, snagging pints in my Chicago grocery stores when they're available. But upon my recent visit to Cincinnati, I wanted to stop in an actual Graeter's location to see the situation first-hand.\n\nThe flavors are top-notch. Basically anything with chocolate \"chips\" is a slam dunk winner. They're not chips so much as giant hunks of delicious chocolate icebergs, just waiting for you to discover them with your spoon.\n\nSo why only 4 stars? The physical condition of this location leaves much to be desired. Everything looks very, very run down and neglected. Even the ice cream was melty as soon as it came out of the freezer. (Might wanna check that temperature - I don't think it's being kept as cold as it should.) The bathrooms were also looking like they'd seen better days.\n\nAgain, this ice cream is perfection, but this particular location needs a serious revamp.",

I mean they're all good. I mean if you like a flavor just try that\". Not \"HEY! Here's our best flavor, or if you like (this this and this) that one would be for you! I asked him was his favorite was and he said \"vanilla\". It was then I figured out he wasn't a good salesman and I would have to find out for myself. The ice cream itself was DELICIOUS. I got the Buckeye, chocolate peanut butter ice cream with peanut butter cookie dough and HUGE chocolate chunks. My partner had the black raspberry chocolate. Again, I wish I could rate this higher, but it's about the whole experience. Wish that guy could've made this an all around experience, but go for the ice cream and really try what you want too!",

      "text": "My boss received 6 pints of Graeter's ice cream as a gift and left it in the office freezer \"for anyone to eat.\" Needless to say, I've been downing bowls of this stuff all week. The Black Raspberry is probably one of the most delicious ice cream flavors I've ever eaten in my entire life. Thumbs up also go to the Mint Chocolate Chip and Cookie Dough. They use giant chunks of dark chocolate in all of these flavors, and the chocolate is at a perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture that blends magnificently into the creamy, but not heavy, ice cream base. \n\nI always thought that my trip to the Ben & Jerry's factory was going to be the most important ice cream-related event of my life, but I am starting to reconsider. It might be worth a trip to Cincinnati just to eat this ice cream on its home turf. Until then, I am probably going to start having it shipped to my apartment in Chicago - thank goodness they have an online store!",

      "text": "This review is going to need a disclaimer... Ever since I knew how to spell my last name, my father has worked for companies specifically known for ice cream. Ice cream in the freezer was constant. Growing up with a constant supply of hard pack ice cream has made me develop a genuine fondness for soft serve in its infinite forms. \n\nBut practically none of that has to do with Graeter's. Read everyone else's reviews... they're all completely valid. In fact, I'm embarrassed that I'm actually putting this review up here. Frankly, I find Graeter's way too rich for me. (Well, that and the first sundae I had years ago just wasn't all I thought it was cracked up to be.) Every flavor is handmade in small batches using the french pot method (which makes it VERY rich), and the chocolate chips are to die for. That's because they aren't chips. They actually throw some melted chocolate into the batch while it's churning and call it a day. :o) Out of all of the flavors, the black raspberry chip is definitely the best. \n\nBelieve it or not, their CAKES (not ice cream cakes, regular cakes) are to die for. I don't know if they sell them at locations other than this one, but you should definitely pick one up next time someone has a birthday. \n\nGraeter's, you'll earn another star back if you just get some peanut butter topping for sundaes. That would be divine.",

      "text": "I saw a multitude of baked goods, candies, pies, and ice creams upon entering Graeter's. I came for Graeter's signature chip ice cream flavors, most notably their Black Raspberry Chip ice cream. But before all that, I sampled a couple of other flavors.\n\nTheir Pumpkin ice cream is a seasonal fall flavor, using real pumpkin pie filling. I can see myself enjoying this one even when it's chilly or rainy outside. The Chocolate Chip ice cream consists of premium vanilla ice cream with dark chocolate chip chunks. A very nice ratio of chocolate chips to ice cream. A classic combination that showcases why Graeter's chip flavors are their signature items.\n\nBring on the Black Raspberry Chip ice cream! It's officially Graeter's signature flavor and all-time bestseller. I got it in a sugar cone for $2.50. Loved this one. Just a creamy, fresh, ideal consistency -- not too hard and not too soft. Black raspberries from Oregon (yes, Oregon!) are triple-washed and incorporated in with dark chocolate chips. The chocolate chip chunks provide a wonderful texture contrast, and the chocolate is a lovely complement to the fruity raspberry ice cream.\n\nThe ice cream started melting several minutes after I tried taking pictures. So yes, it did get a little messy, but hey, it was still fantastic stuff!\n\nI also like that Graeter's ice cream can be found nationwide! It's in my local Fred Meyer store...win! if you haven't had Graeter's before, be sure to try that Black Raspberry Chip ice cream!\n\n(Big thanks to the people at Ohio State University for telling me to go here!)",

      "text": "I wasn't going to write a review about my bad experience but after seeing someone in the reviews say they got discriminated against, I'm DEFINITELY not going to be back now. My experience was minor compared to that, but still ridiculous. \nMy partner and I are vegan and they have dairy free soft serve, so I wanted to take him to try it. We pull up to the window to order, I ask about the flavors. They only had vanilla and orange (weird but ok). So I ask if we can do a vanilla and Oreo flurry, girl says no for some reason and I ask what we can do. She says a shake or cup with toppings. I say two shakes, one large, one small, and she says they \"cant do large for dairy free, because it uses too much product\". I'm getting frustrated at this point but I say medium is fine. She goes to put in the order and comes back to tell me they can't do shakes. I say \"what CAN you do\" and she says ice cream in a cup with toppings. Fine, sure. We pay and it was my mistake I forgot to ask about the ingredients, my partner has a soy allergy but I was told multiple times in the past it was almond milk ice cream. I ask again if it was almond milk ice cream to be sure, girl says yes. I ask if it contains soy just to be safe and she comes back to tell me it's SILK. Silk like soy milk. I asked for clarification because I know silk does make almond milk, but all they kept saying was \"it's silk\" and wouldn't give me an ingredient list. We had to get a refund and we went through it all for nothing. I should have asked in the beginning and that's my bad, but vegans should know before they go you're probably gonna jump through hoops to figure out what you can order if you don't want it plain. \n\nTl;dr \nDon't support them, the owner discriminated against a gay person. But if you do: \nVegans, keep it simple or you're going to jump through hoops to get your order.\nPeople with allergies, ask to see ingredients right off the bat.",

There are so many menu option that you could have a different item everyday of the summer if you wanted! Mind blowing!\n\nNot so humbly submitted,\nKing Michael C.",

The first time the flavor machine was down, second I drove up to the window and they were closed but instead of telling me that they just stood at the drive thru window. This time I actually got my ice cream and it's quite good if not a little thick. Their times on google were wrong, stated they closed at 10 but their sign says 9, thankfully they didn't turn us away. I like the cookie dough flurry I got but I'm still a little skeptical on the service. I mostly only go here if I don't want to travel to putz.",

Great prices and fast service make this a nice thing to have in the area.  I am sure the students leave the school across the street and head directly to this place. \n\nI do not know if the Mayor of Cheviot (Sam Keller cheviot.org/officials.sh…) owns or is even involved with this business or (Keller's Cheviot Cafe yelp.com/biz/cheviot-caf… ), but both are great places to spend your time and money.\n\nSatisfy your sweet tooth and stop by the Cone Zone.

After a horrendous experience last year, I'd figure I'd give it one more shot. Once again... I'm sorry that I did. \n\nValue: you defiantly get a lot for your money. I will give it that.  \n\nEverything else:  last year, my wife and I wanted a nice summer treat so we decided to try this place out. we frequently go to zip dip. I order a flurry and my wife a slush puppy (or something similar). A flurry is similar to a DQ blizzard. I order a snickers flurry. I get handed a melting mess. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY'RE OBSESSED WITH OVER FLOWING THE CUP. She hands me a cup with ice cream and snickers three inches above the rim.  She hands me the melting mess and it's dripping on me. I hand it back to the girl and ask her to get a different one that's not a melted mess. She then gives me my wife's slushy and upon first sip, she starts coughing. She asked me to try it and I do. It was straight up disgusting. Literally like if she made a drink with 80% syrup and 20% slush. It tastes like cherry cough syrup. I ask her to remake it as well. She hands me the new flurry and it's still a melted mess. Their ice cream melts fast.  Even though I've already paid for it, I drive off and decided screw it. I'll take the $8.00 loss. I don't even get the slushy back and I throw that discussing melted mess out the window and drive off. \n\nFast forward to today. I order something called the snowball. Basically, I figured it would be a slushy with ice cream. that's the description. once again... I have no idea why they are so freaking obsessed with overdoing it. they hand me a 16 ounce cup that has a gigantic snowcone over top melting ice cream. The syrup from the snow cone has already begun melting along with the ice cream. it is dripping all over me. It got all over my shirt. The Cherry Syrup Also Got All Over my Shorts. And to Make Matters Even Better... The young Lady Doesn't Even Hand me a Napkin When She Gives me The Item. Needless to Say I Will Never go There Again.\n\nTo sum it up: don't use the drive-through. don't buy the ice cream. go down the road to zip dip and buy it there instead. Stop overflowing your cups. Do try to cram 20 oz in a 16 oz cup. FOR THR LOVE OF GOD, get a different yogurt or  ice cream mixture or adjust your machines so it doesn't melt w/in two seconds of handing it to someone. Also, GIVE OUT NAPKINS.",

      "text": "Our inaugural family visit to the Cone Zone in Cheviot was with mixed reviews.\n\nOverall, we were pretty pleased with the selection and our ice cream. I got a medium chocolate/vanilla twist, my husband got a small Oreo \"flurry\" made with vanilla frozen yogurt, and the kids got a kid-sized orange/vanilla twist and vanilla cone with chocolate dip top, respectively. Both the ice cream and the yogurt were very, very thick, and I would describe the ice cream as being custard-like. While tasty, my husband and I both agreed that there was something about everything that seemed a bit artificial. It made my stomach queasy afterwards, which is what also happens when I try ice cream from buffet restaurants. Perhaps they use mixes?\n\nThey do have a lot of popular ice cream options, plus some unique things like fried ice cream topping and chocolate covered cheesecake on a stick. I really liked that they offered most things with the option of using frozen yogurt (floats, shakes, etc.). That's nice if you are looking for a lighter, healthier option.\n\nOur order came to just over $8, which was pretty reasonable, and although we had cash on us for once, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they are one of the few creamy whips that take credit credits. It's definitely family-run spot with kids helping out, and the location looks really clean and well done.\n\nMy main complaint was how long it took us to get served. They have a walk-up window and a drive-thru for convenience. We opted for the drive-thru, but regretted it immediately. There was no one waiting at the walk-up window and we were only the 3rd car in the drive-thru, but it took us around 20 minutes to get our order. They seemed to have plenty of staff and it was a cooler day, so I can't imagine what it'd be like on a busy hot summer night. \n\nWe'll probably go back, but will definitely try parking and using the walk-up window next time.",

      "text": "There's nothing quite as satisfying as taking a nice healthy walk around the neighborhood and finishing it off with a huge ice cream cone. Sometimes you need a creamy whip that is within walking distance (ok, lots of times).\n\nCone Zone has changed hands a few times over the best 6 or 7 years. The latest owners seem to really enjoy the place and are working hard to make it a neighborhood destination. The biggest new addition is the inside dining area. No longer will rain ruin your creamy whip plans! It has 5 tables and a little bar area and you can place your order inside as well. Very nice!\n\nThe ice cream is good, and the serving sizes are larger than the other creamy whips in the area. Good value for your money. The only bad item I have tried is the strawberry shake. Their strawberry shake uses syrup instead of real strawberries. That's a big no-no for me. \n\nThey also serve coneys and burgers that are good, too. Their chili is more \"real\" chili than \"cincinnati-style\" chili, which was a bit of a surprise (but in a good way).\n\nThey also have parking in the rear of the building and an outside seating area, so everything you need! Go check it out!",

      "text": "I love Chill. My first experience must have been last summer when we ended up talking to one of the owners about her icy creations with homemade simple syrup sugars and amazing flavor combinations as an alternative to artificially colored garbage. I was sold. \n\nThis past weekend they were at the butterfly show and I feel in love all over again. Now that I've been reminded of my crush, I've pursued their refreshing, tasty, glorious icy treats twice this weekend. Yep, once a day. If I could continue to pull that off, I might, but sadly this will be relegated to my weekend treat. When it's warm out it almost trumps ice cream in its clean flavors and tricks you into having some more water. Tasty, tasty water!\n\nI've had the berry, fruit of the islands, strawberry, and lemonade flavors- among some others I can't recall right now- and loved them all equally. The ice is freshly crushed and flavors then poured over. Yum! To add to this you can have it topped with watermelon and mint. All in all, it's a perfect treat. The price is reasonable, $3.50 for a medium, which could certainly be shared. That's your prerogative; I don't often share. \n\nThe owners are friendly and helpful, even remembering my order from the day before...way to be on top of it! Thank you to Chill for having such a fresh treat available for the upcoming summer months. If you haven't tried what they have to offer, definitely check them out. (They're outside of Krause's and Skirtz and Johnson's in case you think you've missed them).",

There are more than 50 flavors, with many of them common and some odd ones. It has a nice seating area. There's a few tables and a porch swing. \n\nI recommend this for anyone who likes these small ice cream places. It's better than going to a worldwide chain.

After passing this stand on numberous occasions, we finally decided to give this stand a try.\n\nTopping and mix-in selection is plentiful at Zip Dip. Candy, cookies, sprinkles, nuts, dips and sauces are all available.  Several flavors of Whirlybird granola are also now available.  There are far more options in that department then flavors of soft serve. Chocolate and vanilla are standard, with two revolving specialty flavors. I prefer my soft serve without toppings. As such, a small flavor selection is a drawback for me. That being said, the chocolate soft serve is rich, creamy and smooth. One of the better chocolate soft serves I have tried. A strong chocolate flavor. \n\nBench seating is available on either side of the building. Tables and a swing are available on the other side of the parking lot. Some of the tables are shaded. At busy times, it can be hard to find parking.",

I wasn't expecting much from my Hamburger just because it is an Ice Cream place but even that was down right yummy! I've actually been craving it now for a few days.

Zip Dip and the pool, I guess, are my saving graces. Reasons to willingly go outside ;) \n\nThere are teens that work here, but they are surprisingly good a managing lines and looking like they care. It's a good crew and really friendly to interact with. They use pen and paper to take orders (drawing boxes around them when complete) and hand calculations for transactions. A nice throwback to a time when cash registers and debit cards weren't required. On that note: cash only, be prepared. \n\nThe area around Zip Dip includes tables, a swing, and angled retaining walls to rest your legs while you enjoy your sweet treats. \n\nMy favorite order is the peanut butter frozen yogurt, a sundae with peanut butter sauce, or any cone combination that might sound interesting or tasty on a given day.\n\nA real treasure, an step back in time, give Zip Dip a try!",

      "text": "It's easy to pass by this tiny West Side establishment, but its pastel colors and neon border will grab your eye. Soon enough, you'll be pulling a U-turn into their parking lot.\n\nZip Dip dishes out over 50 different kinds of soft serve, from your traditional flavors to the more eccentric. If you know me, I always opt for the eccentric. At Zip Dip, this would be the crème brûlée soft serve. Then I got really adventurous and went with a crème brûlée milkshake. It was incredible! I highly recommend giving it a try, if you're bored with the classic flavors.\n\nI can also recommend the regular chocolate shake, which is just the right combination of cream and liquidy to be a thirst quencher.\n\nZip Dip's \"small\" shake starts at 16 oz., which is more than enough milkshake for me. Wearing your elastic pants? They serve milkshakes in 44oz cups. That's almost three pounds of beverage!\n\nZip Dip has been a West Side legacy since 1950. Stop by and become part of its history today!\n\nPrice per person: $3.00",

I can't vouch for their food choices (they do seem reasonably priced) but their ice cream yum. My boyfriend tried the butterfinger flurry and I had the vanilla yogurt with rainbow jimmies. Flurry was excellent it was just enough candy mix and ice cream. The yogurt isn't my favorite only because I prefer real ice cream lol. As a \"healthier\" option though it's suitable. The portions are huge. It looks pricey but when you get it you realize why. My boyfriend mentioned prices when we first got thee (he had never been) and then we're driving home and he said \"oh geez this is soooo much. I didn't realize how much they would give me.\" Definitely a great weather it's hot or cold out.",

The stars of the show are their weekly rotating flavors of ice cream and frozen yogurt, as well as my favorite, the malts. The chocolate malts that I've had from Zip Dip are the best I've had in the city. Extra malty and rich.\n\nOverall, the ice cream here is good, but the portions are the smallest of any creamy whip on our summer quest. That's a bit discouraging, sine they are towards the high end of the creamy whip price range. As well, parking and seating is extremely tight here. On a busy night, parking down a residential street and taking your treats to go is a must.",

It was nice.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the different choices and thought it was great to discover this American icecream roadshop.\n\nThe ice itself however... hmmm, how to explain? I guess I'm used to fresh, Italian ice, with bits and pieces in there. Not the soft ice I got. \n\nSo, 4 stars for the concept, but probably need to try out a few more flavors before I really get something that I adore!",

There is a decent amount of outdoor seating but we did have to share a table with strangers, not a problem. \n\nExtensive menu that I didn't really have a chance to peruse so I had a zebra (chocolate and vanilla) dipped in cherry topping. It was huge and it was only a medium size. Parking is ample and off street. \n\nMy only tips are to eat your ice cream quickly as it will melt all over your hands and the red dip on your hands looks like you are bleeding. Eww!",

I am a fan of the dipped cones, and Don's doesn't disappoint with their variety of dip flavors! Bubble gum? Blueberry, Cherry, Chocolate?? YES PLEASE!! I wonder if I can have my cone dipped in all of the flavors at once?? Hmmm.... \n\nAny who I'm getting off on a tangent, and fueling my own delirious dipping fantasy and this review should also be for YOU the reader... so uh yeah. Let me get back on track. They serve a delicious soft serve, and even have some of the yummiest French fries I've had in awhile. The prices are good, and they have a few tables so you can enjoy your treat on the spot. \n\nThey only take cash, and if you order a dip cone or sprinkly cone, it WILL drip everywhere, most likely causing an ant Apocalypse from the river it forms below your table. You may want to get a bowl to put said weapon of ant mass destruction in. The bowl comes with a spoon, but it'll cost ya .50. It's a bit hidden, so plug it into your GPS, and go find it if you're craving some dairy deliciousness.",

There are regular offerings like cupcakes, cookies and cake (even a pound cake!), but also non-traditional fare like cookie shot glasses which they'll fill with milk there or let you carry out. If they team up with Conscious Kitchen next door, which has a full bar, I could see a fantastic specialty dessert in their future.\n\nHowever, the reason I say run is the Thai rolled ice cream that is made on site. I had never experienced this delicacy firsthand, but it is incredible! You get to add mix-ins to several base flavors and each creation is customized for you. It takes about 5 minutes to make, but watching the process is as fun as eating the final result. I can't wait to go try more flavor combos. \n\nThis is a welcome addition to the Short Vine area, make it a summer favorite!",

I ordered almond vanilla and took it to go. When I got back home I ate it and it tasted like cherry cough syrup. I called the store to let her know in case someone else ordered it. She started getting very aggressive telling me \"it's not cherry I know what I made\" and being extremely rude. I offered to bring it back so she could tell for herself to which she kept telling me I don't need to taste it it's not cherry. I told her it's not what I asked for and asked if she'd remake it if I came in. She told me she'll talk to her partner and call me back. This is 4 hours before they closed and I never received a call. Horrible person, horrible service.",

The portions were larger too. The burgers are the same thin, crispy patties, and the onion rings are nice and crispy too.\n\nThey also have the same shoestring fries, and crispy and grilled chicken, veggie burgers, hot dogs, a kids' menu (that has a grilled cheese, if you ever want a grilled cheese!) and milkshakes, malts, and vanilla and chocolate custard treats, with a lot of options for add-ins.

When I think of a place close by with good, affordable food, Freddy's stands out - even though I've probably only been there like twice!\n\nTheir frozen custard is good, and I usually start eating this before my actual entree arrives.  They have a Veggie Burger, which really isn't anything special, but it gets the job done. For me, the real star of the show is the Freddy's Sauce, which I thoroughly saturate all my fries in.  My biggest complaint is that they need bigger cups for dipping sauces.  :) I use many lol. \n\nIn closing, I don't know that I can really articulate why I like Freddy's so much, but for some reason, I just do. There must be something in the sauce. ;)",

It was hot, it was fresh, it was delicious. It was like the food teleported into my stomach. The burger was so hot and fresh. It tasted homemade. \nI also order the vanila custard with pecan and caramel on top. \nYALL I DON'T KNOW IF I WAS STARVING OR SOMETHING BUT IT WAS SOOO GOOD. \n\nPrice: The price for everything I got was about 10 dollars. And the custard they didn't charge me extra for the pecan and caramel which was cool. Great price range\n\nI went through the drive through around 9 pm and it was fast. My mouth is watering just thinking about going there again. I pray this type of service is an everyday thing. But you know how that goes. \n\nBut with this place around I do not see me going to any fast food place for burgers but here.",

      "text": "I've been here a few times now and the appeal has already worn off.\n\nThey serve burgers and fries just like Steak n Shake. You order at a counter then wait to pick it up at a second counter. So there's no table side service - which is the only noticeable difference from Steak n Shake.\n\nThe food is about as good as you would expect it to be. They give you a mountain of fries (not sure if that's good or bad).\n\nI find it to be overpriced for what it is but I can look past that. However, what I can't look past is their menu. I find it very hard to read since it's 50% desserts and 45% combos. Most of their sandwiches/burgers are not listed separately so you have to guess how much they will cost.\n\nThen if you check your receipt, you'll notice that they charge extra for cheese. There is no mention of this on the menu and every picture shows a cheese. \n\nIf you want to charge extra for cheese then just put that on the menu or train the staff to tell you that it's extra.\n\nDuring this specific visit (Sunday around noon), the wait for food was really long. And they were not busy so it didn't make much sense.\n\nOverall, I don't see myself eating here very often.",

Fries are shoestring if you're into those. The small milkshake was $3.xx and was slightly larger than a kids frosty from Wendy's. (Total was around $11) The burger was extremely salty, torn apart and so thin you could see through it in parts and it was burnt. The bun was good, though.

One huge bonus: they have a veggie burger that ranks pretty high on the taste-o-meter and you can substitute it onto any of the specialty burgers. \n\nThe fries are the skinny ones, so you can trick (lie to) yourself into thinking you aren't eating as many as you are despite the shovel method you use. Plus, chances are you are slathering them up with the amazing mystery sauce (I think it is ketchup, sriracha, mayo, and a touch of cocaine-but no one's talking) as plow through a pile of crispy fried awesome. On my latest visit, I got the veggie burger with the jalapenos, cheese, and bbq sauce- YUM! \n\nThen there's the custard. The PBC and B sundae was...ahh....maze....ing. Real banana bits, real peanut butter cup crumbles, and that custard that is neither too sweet nor too rich. It is the baby bear of sundaes: just right. Go, even if it is just for the custard. \n\nPro tip: The mystery sauce is for the fries. NOT the sundae. Don't be a rookie.",

He asked if I wanted sauce when I paid and I asked for fry sauce which he said he'll go and get but by the time I got my food he had forgot to give me the sauce so I requested it again. He did not advise why I waited and I watched him and someone else through the window serve different people on inside of the restaurant. Once he gave me my food he did apologize for the wait. The food there is okay, nothing spectacular. It was a $2 upcharge for a mini peanut butter crunch (snickers) concrete instead of a drink. \nMy favorite thing there is actually their grilled chicken sandwich and I add Freddy sauce to it but sometimes they overcook the chicken and it ruins the whole meal which is why I don't go here as much as I would like to since I don't want to pay for overcooked food and I always get it to go so I don't find out until I'm at home that it is overcooked.",

      "text": "The thinnest dryest burger I have ever had....  Thoroughly unenjoyable, Steak n'Shake is miles better and that's not that great.  Also annoying ate two separate lines for food and custard, so if you order a shake, you might get it alot earlier than your food, which happened to me... Oh and a custard joint that has only vanilla and chocolate?!?  My regular chocolate shake was acceptable, but nothing to be overjoyed about. \n\nThe fries are those mini ones, which to me are totally annoying.  You do however get alot of them... But they certainly are not 5 Guys fries...  It cost me $10.15 for the original \"double\" burger - which is still thinner than most singles anywhere else - fries and a regular shake. \n\nThis place won't be on Guy Fieri's hitlist, and frankly - I hate to say it - McDonald's is tastier.... And cheaper.",

The Chicago Dog is also very good, though maybe not quite as outstanding as the best I've had in Chicagoland. The frozen custard is above reproach. It is rich, thick and silky with excellent flavor. The Turtle Sundae is totally worth the calorie hit.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the service can be a little uneven. It seems like they have a lot of turnover there because I never see the same person behind the counter twice.  As a result,  they seem to always be training new folks which hurts consistency a bit, but that's a minor rub.",

I'm a sucker for just good old chocolate, so that was my selection a small chocolate twist in a cake cone.\nOthers in line before me ordered sundaes, soft serve in cup and an icee.\nThe team was very friendly & took care of several orders in minutes.\nStop by the next time you're in the area for a delicious ice cold treat!",

When they opened, I took a glance at the menu & ordered a steak burger, chips, & a Pepsi & it came to a very reasonable $5.  \n\nThe woman who took my order was very friendly, provided a lot of information, & offered me extra napkins, probably assuming (correctly) that I'm a bit of a slob.  Very much appreciated.\n\nThe steak burger was very good, surprisingly so.  \n\nAfter finishing it & the rest of my lunch at one of the pair of picnic tables that are available in addition to a handful of benches, I went back for dessert.  I saw that they had black cherry (a favorite flavor of mine), so I asked for a cone of that only to be informed that the black cherry is actually a sort of flavor \"blast\" that's added to their vanilla soft serve.  What sorcery is this?  They also have blueberry cones that are straight up blue, but I'll save that for when I visit King's Island.\n\nIt too was excellent, though I have to learn to eat before driving. Or at least peal the paper off the cone before driving, because doing so while driving is dangerous & difficult.  \n\nAs for the Dole Whip? I was hoping for pineapple, the old standby, as I'd planned to make a Dole Whip Float to celebrate my upcoming birthday, but they only had lemon or lime. I guess I'll pay attention to their social media & hope that pineapple, or maybe even raspberry, makes an appearance later this summer.\n\nGood stuff!",

Service is friendly and there are dairy free options if you're interested. They even serve the Dole Fruit Whips that I love when visiting Hawaii... except here you don't need to take an 8 hour flight! \n\nThey're open late and the service is friendly!

Just know that it's cash only. It seems most of these independent ice cream places are. That's the only bad thing about here. \n\nI would say this is one of the cheapest places to get food in Norwood. It's still best to avoid the greasy fried items and stick to the ice cream.

Once we did order we got our ice cream SO FAST - we hadn't even finished paying by the time they came out! Amazing service. \nNOTE: All reviews all correct - this is CASH ONLY. \n\nI ordered a small chocolate/vanilla twist with chocolate sprinkles on a cake cone and my boyfriend a small blueberry/vanilla twist on a cake cone. The smalls were decent sizes - I originally asked the difference between small and medium and note - the medium comes on a larger cake cone and is also taller than a small - so a somewhat significant difference in height/width. \n\nIn total it was $5.75 for the two cones. \nBoth were delicious and we ate them extremely fast - actually leaving us for wanting more! \n\nRatings on the Morgan Scale:\nOverall Experience: 9/10\nFood Price: 8/10\nFood Experience: 9/10",

      "text": "NORWOOD STAPLE. Hands down, the best ice creamery in Norwood, Ohio! Specializing in soft-serve, Norwood Delite Creamy Whip is a small, roadside ice cream mom & pop shop that reminds you of the go-to hangout after classes or work. The soft serve is creamy and the perfect quality of sweetness for your classic flavors of chocolate and vanilla (with some promotional/seasonal flavors here and there). They have a lot to offer besides soft serve such as sundaes, traditional ice cream and popsicle selections, and even non-sweet items like burgers and fries. All of which are super cheap and what'd you expect from this kind of establishment but with the added benefit of exceptional quality. I'd come here everyday but the thing is I'm not a big soft-serve guy nor would it be in my best interest health-wise. However, it's the perfect spot to hangout and eat some delicious cold serve.",

They take cash only and do not offer an ATM. There is a gas station near by that has one if needed.\n\nI ordered the strawberry shortcake and it was huge! It had plenty of good vanilla soft serve over an angle food cake round with plenty strawberry topping and whipped cream. It could have fed two, but I only shared a couple of bites with my husband.\n\nThis is a great neighborhood stop on a warm day.",

For a large waffle cone with soft serve vanilla and sprinkles I spent $3.75. FYI this creamery is CASH ONLY!! Overall, this is such a great find.

Kind of an inconvenience in this day in age, especially when we waited in line and then had to return to the back of the line once we got our cash. It wasn't super busy on this Thursday night, so we did it.\n\nI like my ice cream simple, so I ordered a small chocolate cone. I was expecting a creamy chocolate that comes out a light brown color. I got something that was more along the consistency of a fudge pop. It was dark brown and kind of an icy consistency. Definitely not what I was expecting and was a major disappointment for me.\n\nMy husband ordered a large vanilla cone with sprinkles. They were out of sprinkles, so the employee there talked him into a sort of cereal type sprinkle dip. I'm not sure what it was called. He said it was good but a little different. He was also a little disappointed in the consistency of his ice cream - more icy than creamy.\n\nWith \"Creamy Whip\" in the title we were just expecting a different kind of ice cream. We might be a little picky, but we probably won't be back. Just not what we had in mind and not our favorite kind of soft-serve.",

      "text": "Your typical home-town creamy whip: tacky, cheap, tasty, and nothing spectacular... but on those hot summer days, nothing can beat it!  Don't expect the best ice cream of your life, but if you're looking for a classic twist cone with sprinkles, look no farther.  Their cones (vanilla, chocolate, blueberry, or twist) start at $2.50 for a small, and portions are generous. Toppings are a little extra, but it's hard to pass up their \"crunch coat\" which is a mysterious mixture of sprinkles, cone pieces, and other stuff. My favorite is a Glacier, which comes with a huge swirl of ice cream, covered in a slushy.  Other selections include sundaes, blizzards, milkshakes, and a few food items.\nBiggest complaint? They close too early in the year!  They open in early April, when it is often still frosty at times in Cincinnati, but close around Labor Day, leaving several more 75+ degree September/October days in Norwood without a Creamy Whip.",

The teenager working the entire place, sun damaged handwritten signs, picnic tables outside (actually a lot of seating is outside), and cheap ways to spruce up a soft serve (dips, toppings, or making it a shake). Yet, I do love these places 'cause it takes me back to simpler times; when a single ice cream cone can brighten up your day.\n\nTaking a star away because no outside fountain (to wash hands, etc.), lack of dips/toppings (yes, there are more at others), and they were out of ice cream sandwiches :'(",

And the pretzel was pretty sizeable too, filling me up nicely before dinner. I'd definitely recommend this place!",

I was hanging out with a friend who lives down the street and just happened to mention that I would kill for a chocolate, vanilla twist in a cup cone. Little did I know that my wish would be granted in less than 10 minutes.\n\nIf you didn't know it was there, you might pass the building a hundred time before you even realized what it was. But there is no way you can't appreciate a little place like this.They have everything you'd expect an old school ice cream joint to have--all those ridiculous cartoon character popsicles that turn your kid's lips unnatural colors, ice cream sandwiches, and then anything you can possible make with soft serve. I got a little greedy and bought the large soft serve in a cone. I wanted to barf later because no one needs that much ice cream, but I enjoyed every second I spent snarfing it down. \n\nApparently the joint literally gets boarded up in the winter (because it's all outdoor seating and who really wants ice cream in the winter anyway?), but this is definitely a place to hit up in the summer.",

      "text": "I'm from Louisville and had heard of Insomnia Cookies (now I get it, available until 3a). During a day trip to this area I spotted the shop on our way back to the car and had to experience the cookies. \n\nAfter stepping inside my friend and I had to go back out. The shop is currently allowing only 2 customers inside at once. It only took an extra minute and then we were back in to order.\n\nMy friend opted for a peanut butter cookie while I got the combo with two cookies and a beverage (water or milk). The snickerdoodle and MM chip were both delicious. Both cookies super warm like being right out of the oven. Deluxe cookies are also available for an up charge as well as birthday cookies. \n\nThe shop isn't taking cash due to Covid; however, they keep a tip container out front and cash is welcome there. Cookies had to be paid by credit card. You also have to take your order and go - no standing at the high tops to eat your cookies. My friend laughed he was worn out by all the rules! It was a lot compared to the other stops along Calhoun, Ohio and McMillian. \n\nWould be excited to stop by again or for Louisville to get a location. We need more options, especially late night options.",

I had a pickup order that was supposed to be ready for me, but despite miscommunication to the employees about the order, they accommodated so incredibly well with a friendly face. They gave me all my delicious cookies, cookie butter, and ice cream, and even threw in a bonus cookie for my trouble.\n\nAnd the cookies were incredibly hot and fresh, much better than some previous experiences I've had. Definitely recommend the deluxe cookies!",

I've never had crunchy insomnia cookies before; I always expect them to be soft. I'm not sure if they were hard because they were vegan or if they were just overbaked. \n\nHere is my ranking of the vegan flavors:\n1. chocolate chip\n2. double chocolate chip\n3. birthday cake",

      "text": "Insomnia Cookies was an all right sounding idea to me.  \nHowever, I've never had one until someone in the office ordered them for us.  I can honestly say it was one of the best cookies I've eaten in a LONG time.\n\nThe cookies arrived in a purple and gray pizza box, which was very warm.  Inside the box were a variety of cookies:\nClassic with M&Ms, Chocolate Chunk, Double Chocolate Chunk, White Chocolate and Peanut Butter...each in its own small bag.\n\nI chose my favorite out of the bunch--Peanut Butter.  The taste was terrific, to say the least!  Each soft, melty bite was the equivalent to floating down a lazy river in an inner tube.  Enjoyable to the very last bite!  \n\nIf you have a sweet spot for warm, soft cookies, I would highly recommend Insomnia Cookies.  You won't be disappointed!",

      "text": "I order insomnia about once or twice a month. I have a sweet tooth that just can't be contained. Typically they have a special during each day of the week and you can order just about anything you'd like or sample any of their menu items. My favorite promotion is their bogo which is by one get one free cookie pack. \n\nThere are two locations in Cincinnati one in downtown and one in Clifton right on Calhoun. Every time I order typically I get the cookies delivered because it's late at night and I don't want to violate the current curfew by running to get cookies--and mainly because they deliver until 3 am every night. \n\nMy favorites from their menu are the chocolate chunk, triple chocolate, snickerdoodle, s'mores and white chocolate macadamia. All their other items are pretty delicious as well. The price per cookie is $1.75 and runs higher if you get their deluxe cookies $3.25. I personally had one delivered to me on a special day and it just brightens your day & it's also really delicious. Other menu items include milk and ice cream cookies and brownies. Though, I typically just get cookies from their menu. \n\nOverall their cookies are very delicious. I highly recommend if you're looking for a midnight snack or just craving sweets. Pro-tip order ahead for the items because they tend to have busy wait times especially on weekends. Also take advantage of their daily promos listened on their website or through email.",

They are served fresh and warm, which makes them irresistible when purchasing. \n\nThey are conveniently located on the University of Cincinnati's campus alongside a lot of other great food options. When you enter, you will be able to see what the product looks like and can choose the quantity wanted. \n\nThe reasoning for the 4/5 stars was due to the price (costly) and the flavor if not eaten immediately. My recommendation would be to eat them when you buy as they aren't the best when you let them sit for a few hours. Enjoy!",

Ordered a dozen (6 free) as a treat to surprise my co-workers with warm fresh cookies on a Friday afternoon. Ordered at 3:15 p.m. and website said delivery at approximately 4:00 p.m. Email confirmation supplied a tracking number/link as well.  All the way up until 5:15 p.m. the tracking just said \"baking\" (next options were \"out for delivery\" and \"you're the next stop\"). No answer at the store when I tried to contact.  As I was leaving at 5:15 p.m. my cell phone rang and the delivery person was in my building lobby with my not-very-warm cookies.  \n\nThey just need to manage expectations.  Don't tell me warm cookies are coming if you can't deliver them when they are ready.  Give realistic delivery timelines on your website when an order is placed. And use your tracking software as it was intended or disconnect it.  \n\nBut the cookies were good - my family enjoyed them instead of my co-workers!  Not sure I would pay full price unless I could count on the service.",

      "text": "I love the concept. The cookies are kept in a warmer. Walking in and being able to bite into a warm cookie is pretty awesome. \n\nIt is the warmer is what keeps me from giving Insomnia Cookies another star. Most of the cookies we had remained soft on the inside. Unfortunately, the cookies had been in the warmers for too long. The sides were crisp, and dried out. They had the consistency of croutons. The two coming together just did not mix. For the price, the cookie shouldn't be dried out the way it was. Also, since the cookies were warm they melted the ice cream of the ice cream sandwiches too quickly. The first bite caused the majority of the ice cream to fall out. We all were eating our ice cream with a spoon. A solution to both problems may be to remove the cookies from the warmer before they dry out. The cooled/ room temperature cookies could be used for ice cream sandwiches. \n\nFlavors of the cookies were decent. A fun part of the ice cream sandwiches is that not only do you get to pick the ice cream, and the cookies, but you may also pick different cookies for the top and the bottom.",

For it to actual exist is another level of amazing. \n\nThey have pretty delicious cookies. I always love the m&m and mint chocolate chip cookies the most. They also have milk, and ice cream for extra snacking. \n\nYou don't have to have your snacks delivered from here. They have a store front that you can go into and pick your cookies out yourself and take them home. \n\nI guess my only issue with Insomnia Cookies is the prices. Everything is a little pricey for just cookies, or just ice cream. \n\nGo to place for a late night snack, though. For sure.",

      "text": "Throughout college I was always jealous of my friends who had insomnia cookies on their campus. While pulling all-nighters I'd always get snaps from them showcasing their cookie a la modes or cookiewiches. I always thought this was a wonderful concept and a cookie lovers dream. Nothing would beat having a cookie delivered to me while studying--who ever thought of this idea was a genius.  \n\nI always wanted to try this place and I unexpectedly saw it on the UC campus. I was so excited!! I had just eaten dinner and still decided to run to this place.. I HAD TO TRY IT.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, the aroma of cookies was overbearing (in a good way) to the point that I could only focus on the cookies in front of me (they strategically have their cookies showcased right at the entrance). I honestly wanted to try all of them!\n\nTheir menu was straightforward. I appreciate that they have multiple options such as the cookie a la mode option for those that don't want the whole sandwich and may be watching calorie intake. \n\nI ordered the double chocolate mint cookie and cookie dough ice cream. The cookie was served to me warm and was good quality (definitely a 4). However, I was very disappointed in the ice cream. It wasn't rich nor creamy...it was a bit bland and watered down (it was about a 2). This was a new batch of ice cream--so it's either that they have not chosen to invest in  quality ice cream or my ice cream preference differs from their typical clientele.I would not order the ice cream again. I have a sweet tooth and I did not finish it. I only ate the cookie. \n\nThe cookie experience was well worth my run and I appreciated the service. The server was friendly and took the time to open a fresh new cookie dough batch of ice cream for me. \n\nI will definitely be back to try another cookie! Cookies are my weakness. :D #Iamthecincycookiemonster",

I always hang up with fingers crossed that the right thing gets delivered to my house after my ridiculous 35-40 minute wait. \n\nWhich brings me to another point: 35-40 minutes for cookies? I've never even waited that long for pizza to be delivered. \n\nThe cookies themselves are not much to write home about. The first time we ordered mine weren't even warm and my boyfriend's brownie looked like it wasn't warmed at all and was cold. I've made better tasting cookies myself and with the wait time and overpricing, I could have gone to Kroger and got a pack of break and bakes.

Walk in and you are filled with the smell of fresh cookies baking. Can't go? Just get them delivered to your dorm, apartment or office. I have taken these to meetings and class presentations, and they are always a hit. Whenever they are giving them away free on UC's campus, people flock for them. My particular favorites are double chocolate chunk and the current seasonal option, cranberry orange oatmeal (which has a good amount of orange flavoring making it taste light and citrusy).\n\nIt is a niche market establishment though. They know their cookies are good and in high demand at certain times so the mark up is HUGE (see thr other reviews). I would love to see some \"happy hour\" esque deals for people to come in during slower times. That would definitely bring me in more often. I am subscribed to their email list though so I get notifications when they have ice cream sandwich or bulk buy deals going on. \n\nNext time: I'll be trying their ice cream sandwich.

But the cookies are always great and delivery is super fast.\n\nI ordered online with a coupon code to get 2 free cookies and for some reason, it didn't show up on the order even though I had the coupon applied as well as the items. I tried reaching them by phone both on the customer service line and ordering line. Couldn't reach anyone and gave up after 10 minutes on each. It's not a busy night- my order was delivered before I could reach anyone on the phone. So, the delivery was fast, but so fast that I couldn't fix the order at all. I only ordered to use the coupon.\n\nPros:\n-Good cookies\n-FAST Delivery\n\nCons: \n-Good luck reaching them by phone. Just do it online.\n-Checkout didn't put in my coupon, which is the reason I ordered\n-Delivery can be $6+ even if you live very near it (on campus)... go by foot, if you can, even though I think their whole thing is delivery.\n-Delivery drivers will never come to your door. Once they couldn't seem to find the Calhoun dorms last year, despite it being down the street. Sometimes you have to go outside to go get it, but that seems like a common issue with delivery here.",

Walk-ins are definitely welcome!\n\nIt's a small little shop with a whole lot to offer.  Even ice cream.  I ordered one of their deluxe cookies with ice cream, and was really satisfied!! The cookie was warm and gooey, and oh so good!! The ice cream was good, but I wouldn't say there's anything extremely special about it - worth the try, but I may just order cookies when I visit from now on.\n\nThey have two tiers of the cookies, I'm can't remember the names so let's go with standard and deluxe for the sake of describing them. The standard includes your average cookie, like snicker doodles for a lower cost. Then you have the Deluxe, which is what I went for. I had a reese's cup type cookie that was amazing, but there are other options like s'mores.\n\nI plan to visit this place more when I'm in the area!",

It's such a clever concept, granted they do charge a premium, around $1.50 a cookie. They have several varieties, although nothing out of the ordinary. We had to wait for our order, but they were fresh and warm.  The cookies are fresh and warm which is pretty much perfect. They also serve ice cream with all the add ins and milk. It's the perfect combo! Great place for a quick snack. Although, it seems a little pricy to me, given the flavors aren't anything special and it's like a buck and a half for one cookie. That being said, the cookies are quite tasty!",

However, since most everyone was ordering their fix at the counter and what we were buying was all 'pre-made', we were able to get in, pay and eat out very quickly. \n\nGraeter's ice cream is the best; I don't care where the store is.

I've always found the chocolate chips in my ice cream to be rock-hard and stubborn pieces of chocolate that refuse to melt at the same pace as the rest of the dessert, so I was doubtful when I heard black raspberry chocolate chip was the best selling flavor. I confess I've been wrong all along, because Graeter's showed me that the impossible is possible, and chocolate chips can be delicious in ice cream.\nThe way Graeter's chocolate melts in your mouth is magical. Fruity flavors can taste artificial sometimes, but this black raspberry was very natural and not overly sweet, pairing well with the chocolate.

There were only three people ahead of us on a Saturday around 4 pm. The experience was fun and the staff was pleasant but not overfriendly or talkative. I like that you can sit and people watch.

Which in my opinion, is one of the joys of being in an ice-cream shop; is to see the variety of ice-creams displayed right in front of your eyes. Theirs is like hidden behind the counter or something. \n\nGraeter's is apparently a must if you're in Ohio, but the ice cream is subpar. It's a grainy ice cream rather than creamy and smooth. It lacks flavor. For example, the salted caramel with chocolate chips, neither tasted like caramel nor salt. It was a straight sweet ice-cream with chocolate chips. In a blind taste test, I might have guessed it was vanilla. What they did well and are known for are the chocolate chips. Rather than being rock solid, they were soft and melted in your mouth. \n\nThe thing about Graeter's is that it has a history and a place in Ohio's heart. It has that vintage charm. But in comparison to other must visit ice-cream places, it comes in last place.",

The Cookies & Cream ice cream has a nice and creamy vanilla base with chunks of Oreo Cookie mixed throughout. Amazing! Sometimes you get the big chucks (half an Oreo) and I love those. I've tried maybe one or two other flavors but I always come back to Cookies & Cream. This flavor is also my husband's favorite so that's why we order it the majority of the time. I like it as well but we usually always share sweets anywhere we go so this is the one flavor we can agree on. Occasionally I will get Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough because that was my favorite flavor growing up, and I still like it as an adult. My husband doesn't like it so usually when I get this flavor we don't share but it's not often. \n\nOverall, Graeter's has some good ice cream and is my go to spot when I want a sweet cold treat. While we always get Cookies & Cream they do have other good flavors. Give them a try and I'm positive you won't be disappointed.",

It has the feel of an old time corner ice cream shop. \n\nLocated in Vine Street where all the action is, this particular Graeter's made me feel like I was walking back in time, in a good way. On a recent steamy Sunday afternoon I headed in with a friend for a cone and to cool off! \n\nA few samples later, I had decided on my old summertime favorite of peach. If you haven't had this one yet, I highly recommend that you get a scoop or two of Graeter's peach while it lasts -- it's one that many people anticipate all year long. \n\nThe cool shop was just the pick me up that I needed on the hot afternoon. A few minutes later I was cooled off, refreshed, and ready to take on the rest of my weekend.",

So be sure to order a flavor that comes with those. Their most famous flavor is Black Raspberry Chip. Even if you're not usually a fruity ice cream fan, I would at least recommend that you sample it. Because they'll let you sample as much as you want!\n\nNow, this location might be a little busier than others. They don't have their own parking lot, so you'll have to find a meter or go to a garage. And this place is sometimes understaffed. I just went this past Saturday around 3p. There was a group of six of us and a few other people in and out and only one guy there to scoop and run the register. I don't know how he did it, but he got it done!\n\nIf you plan on becoming a regular, get a rewards card! Once you've spent $100, you get $5 free! Also, you get a free sundae on your birthday!!",

I didn't know what I wanted or which flavors of ice cream they sell. Feelings rushed I asked to taste the cotton candy. I ordered the cotton candy and was trying to decide on a cone when the sales associate suggested pretzel. After receiving the cone, while I was looking for napkins, again I was asked to pay.

      "text": "In all rivalries, there's a good guy and a bad guy, with one's loyalty usually falling where their butt fell first. \nMichigan vs Ohio State.......Biggie vs Tupac........Donald Trump vs Orange Paint. You get the idea. \nAnd then there's Graeters vs UDF, with Graeters' name implicitly implying superiority......the gaul and balls on that burgundy-cursive ice cream shop. \n\nMy heart has always cuddled with the underdog, but with too many locals and talk show hosts singing Graeters' praises, I decided to decide it once and for all - Graeters or UDF?  \n\nSo one fateful Monday in a hot AF* August (*As Fireball), a friend and I skipped lunch and dinner to save space for frozen justice.  Back-to-back we went, OTR Graeters to Mt Adams UDF, scoring for taste, sample size, and in the words of no English teacher, funnity. \n\n1) Graeters' samples were like refugee camp rations, while UDF fit a whole bowl on the bowl of a sample spoon. #TigOl'Samples\n(*UDF did say that they cap sample-asks at 5.  Brave be the sugar soldier who asks for more than 5, while impatient infants breathe down their neck.)\n2) In Graeters' defense, they're exclusively ice cream, while UDF has expanded into related markets like gasoline.  But Graeters hasn't instilled nearly enough fun around a product that literally sells itself.  Most of the swag for sale there belong in a golf pro shop (with the one exception being Beanboozled, which if you haven't played, is definitely funnity). \n3) Also, an ice cream shop's staff makes all the difference - and Graeters' scoopers tend to be middle-aged men, when really who you want serving you is an assistant baton twirler.  And UDF HAD THAT, in Savannah, Jay Jay, and Alicia, who dubbed herself the Shake Queen. \nThey truly made our UDF experience extraordinary and playful, which every ice cream experience should be.  After all, ice cream is the culinary manifestation of playtime.\nIn fact, when I couldn't find a pint of Mint Cookies n Cream, Jay Jay suited up in an astronaut's beekeeper suit, grabbed some from the back, and filled it into a Chinese takeout carton.  #TradeWars4What \nMeanwhile, Graeters' idea of playfulness was suggesting Cookies n Cream with a scoop of Watermelon. That's like your Mom making you wear a tuxedo on the first day of kindergarten, but trying to fun it up with a tie-dye pocket square. #projecting  \n4) I will say that my heart always sidelined with UDF's Cookies n Cream. It was my Sun and my Moon. But Graeters' pint-style rendition did sincerely impress. It's just a shame that Graeters' name is written on the carton like it's a baseball jersey. It's the one thing holding Graeters back from hitting the flavor out of the park. \n\nAlso, the UDF girls did let us in on a little secret - that UDF private-label manufactures some of Graeters' flavors for Graeters.  That's like Chuck E Cheese secretly making some pies for LaRosas. Now I don't know if it's true, but let this review ring the Alexander Bell to begin a game of Telephone. \n\nWhat I do know as truth is that Graeters' tradition has unwavered through time. In some ways, that's good, that they're not falling prey to new-age ice cream flavors like Sriracha Nutella.  But UDF is still Undoubtedly Da Funnest. \n\nAnd after that all-ice-cream diet, I'm overfed and undernourished. Drop me at the ER",

I have been asked about this new flavor by several people who are interested in trying it so I want to be accurate about it.                                             The ice cream is toffee flavored. The milk chocolate caramel cups are described as truffles. I could not make that distinction when I had it. There were so few of them and they are very small compared to the chocolate chunks in their other ice cream flavors.                           As for the peanuts they are salted and taste good but there are way too many of them in this ice cream. The texture is too chunky with peanuts and there is not enough of the competing toffee ice cream and chocolate caramel flavor. I can't recommend this new creation in honor of Cincinnati's Fiona the hippo for chocolate lovers. Until next time be kind to each other.#cincyyelp",

Thomas location but today we were in OTR and it was a perfect day for ice cream.\n\nFirst off, the gentleman working was so welcoming and nice! He gets several gold stars for giving excellent customer service. That alone made our visit outstanding.\n\nToday I tried the black raspberry gelato for the first time. You get the same great taste of their signature flavor but a bit less indulgent but very creamy and light.  Right now they have a seasonal flavor of orange cream which my husband raves about. It's the closest thing to an ice cream flavor he misses from his hometown in Chile.\n\nI'm so glad Graeter's is in OTR because there's no other ice cream shop around!",

The price is totally great compare to the price and amount we have in New York. I didn't order online cuz I didn't found the my favorite flavor online (blueberry). I also like the cheesecake flavor.

But the geniuses that be have called upon the gods to introduce the pretzel cone. Yes you heard me correct. A salty delicious pretzel cone that houses your deliciously sweet treat. Seeing as I am not a huge fan of chocolate or sweets I love the addition of the salty cone. I would suggest getting the peanut butter or chocolate as it really brings out the flavor.

      "text": "You know OTR is in the full-on throes of gentrification when Graeter's opens up a scoop shop there. After dinner at Arnold's the other day and with a super singed tongue from a very hot cup of tea that morning, I wanted a cold dessert. Enter the Graeter's on Vine Street.\n\nI'm not sure if this has happened at the other Graeter's, but there are some really distinctive branding and ingredient changes to Graeter's that were very apparent at the OTR location. The menu had a much different appearance than the menus I grew up with. Fiance got mint chocolate chip, which I distinctively remember having that minty green color of my childhood visits to Graeter's. Today, it is a normal cream colored ice cream -- though it still tastes very minty! \n\nWish they had had the little self-serve water fountain many other locations have. Props to the employees who gave me a Flavor of the Month magnet (though confusingly, they were offering some flavors that the magnet said are only available in autumn) and got me signed up with one of the rewards calls. What's really funny is that a few nights later, we were at the Esquire, and one of the employees said \"Hey, weren't you at Graeter's the other night?\" Now that's an attentive employee! Glad to see this newest addition to Vine Street, and I hope it does well.",

      "text": "My wife introduced me to Graeter's when we first started dating 7 years ago. I was promised \"the best ice cream you'll ever have.\" As with most expectations, I went in skeptical, but boy was I surprised! Her statement was 100% correct. Graeter's is the smoothest, creamiest, most flavorful ice cream I've ever had. I regularly come back time and again. The black raspberry chip is my consistent favorite, but I've recently been branching out to the Black Cherry Chip. The seasonal flavors are always great, and they provide a good excuse to return regularly (as if you needed that). I should qualify my statement on best ice cream: My wife is certainly the aficionado in the family when it comes to ice cream, and she sees a plethora of criteria and seems to be impressed with subtle distinctions. While I respect that, I'm pretty basic when it comes to what I like: It has to have amazing constantly and incredible flavor. If those two things are there, I'm happy. Unfortunately, SO MUCH ice cream fails one or both of these criteria. Graeter's not only satisfies both of these; it exceeds them. If you are feeling like doing some ready, look up the French Pot method they have used since the mid 19th century to make the ice cream; it's fascinating. Graeter's will always be my local go-to when it comes to dessert. I also have a friend out of town who pays $$$ to have it shipped across the country for his parties, so you know it must be good. Trust me, go here.",

Then he handed me my receipt and told me I had over 100 Graeter's points so I was eligible for a free item up to $12.95. (He said it could only be redeemed that day) I asked if it could be ice cream but he said merchandise only. So I asked him to show me the t-shirts they sell and in a very annoyed voice said, \"We don't have any of them up here, I'd have to go ALL the way to the basement to get one.\" So I asked if he could get one before my family and I left and said, probably not.\"  So here I have this REWARD coupon valid only that day for being a very regular customer and he refused to show me the item I wanted. Lastly, I saw a few of the t-shirts displayed on a window sill, grabbed my size and took it back to the register to claim my rewards item. He then tells me I can only get the t-shirt if I make a purchase to which I responded, I just bought 5 cups of ice-cream. Not to mention, NO WHERE was it stated that I could only get my reward with a second purchase. So the nice lady next to me told him to use her ice cream cone on my rewards card so it would count for another purchase and he got mad about that and the tried to over charge her for her cone. I was FINALLY given the shirt and he wouldn't let me keep my receipt for the free item even though he'd already scanned the bar code, so I took a photo of it for proof that no where stated I had to make another purchase to receive my free item. Bottom line, his attitude was terrible, he acted like I was bothering him when I asked to see the t-shirts in the first place, then acted annoyed the he had to make a correction after over charging me on my first transaction, and then was refusing to give me the free item is earned by spending more than $100 at Graeter's.  I will only return there if I don't mind being treated poorly simply for asking for the attendant to serve me/the customer, don't mind being told \"no\" when asking to see some merchandise, don't care if I'm over charged, and lastly, being lied to in order to get more money/another transaction.  Sorry Graeter's, you'll always be my favorite ice creamery but today's visit left a poor taste in my mouth!!ml",

There is nothing better than watching a good Indy film at The Esquire then getting some ice cream at Graeter's (bonus points if It's nice enough to walk around the neighborhood with said ice cream).\n\nThe staff here is always super friendly too.  Graeter's currently (during social distancing) offers pickup OR DELIVERY (I repeat, you can get Graeter's delivery). All the flavors are good, but I'm definitely a sucker for the Buckeye Blitz and the Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip (because duh). Even writing about it has me pondering when I can get some Graeter's ASAP.",

      "text": "Graeter's ice cream is a big deal in Ohio and I can see why. It was some of the richest, thickest ice creams I've ever had. I ordered the black raspberry chocolate chip and the buckeye blitz chocolate chip. The black raspberry flavor went real well with the chocolate chunks, and the peanut butter cookie dough of the buckeye blitz was nice and chewy. The other reviewers are not wrong when they mentioned large chocolate chip chunks in the ice cream. It gave a nice crunch and had just the right amount of bitterness to take the smooth, sweet ice cream to another level. I wish they had these outside of the mid-west, but for now, I'll always seek out Graeters when I'm there.",

However, I am writing a review about their ice cream CAKE. \n\nI bought the chocolate fantasy cake for someone's birthday, and it was pure ecstasy. They only have one size for their cakes. It serves 12 people for $35. I was originally worried that the cake was too big because I only planned on serving 2 people but NOPE --  I am 100% positive that I can finish this entire cake ON MY OWN within a few days. The chocolate fantasy cake was the perfect balance of cake, ice cream, chocolate whipped cream, and fudge on top. The fudge oozes down as you slice into the cake. PURE ECSTASY. I wish Graeter's can serve slices of ice cream cake as well so I can resist buying entire cakes for myself.",

While this combo disgusted my friends, I think the richness of dark chocolate perfectly complimented and was cut by the tart and sweet mango sorbet. \n\nThis recent visit was a bit disappointing since they did not have the dark choc flavor. Went with a different approach and tried the raspberry sorbet and bourbon pecan. Sorbet was a bit too sweet in my opinion but flavorful. Bourbon pecan was a delight, could actually taste the subtle sweet notes of bourbon!\n\nThey come up with interesting limited and seasonal flavors as well- right now the whole pumpkin jazz is in full swing. \n\nServers are incredibly sweet and efficient, hardly have to wait in line considering it's popularity. \n\nHave sundaes, pints, some baked good and candies too. \n\n- As lovely as this neighborhood is, parking is annoying.  Street gets super busy in evening. Try street- couple blocks in.",

I had 14 days to use it. With the time running out I came here on a week night. It was Valentine's Day but it was not busy upon arriving. My interaction with the college age employee was very pleasant. He gave me a taste of the new seasonal cherry chocolate chip which I decided to get. However during our conversation the female manager on duty abruptly and sharply spoke up to make it clear that it was a kid's sugar cone that was free. If I wanted a cup not a cone it would be a small size. I felt bad for the employee. Upon requesting a topping of chocolate sprinkles she again abruptly cut in to point out that a topping makes it a sundae. So it wouldn't be free stating that the register does not allow it to be rung up that way. I felt disrespected and knew that a topping would cost me extra but did not get the opportunity to say it. I switched to the bittersweet chocolate sauce & it tasted great. However I left feeling disrespected and sad for the employee. Until next time be kind to each other. #graetersicecream #yelpcincy",

I felt it was a little pricey coming out to $10 for the two cones we ordered but got to add it to the Ohio must-have experience checklist",

A \"traditional\" bowl costs a little under $4 and gets you a large scoop of delicious ice cream. I thought it was a bit pricy at first, but after devouring it, soooo worth it.\n\nThe only thing I don't like about their ice cream are the giant chocolate chips inside. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate and having to crunch giant chips is a bit annoying. Fortunately, there was only one monster-sized chocolate chip in the cup so I didn't waste too much.\n\nAs for this location, I wanted to linger a bit more but my husband was eager to get our ice cream and head out the door to the plaza across the street. I didn't really get to explore but I did spot a little bakery area with cookies, homemade candies, treats, and gifts in additon to the ice cream counter. A few vintage-y tables are available for a place to sit down. Overall, pretty cute place.\n\nCan't wait to get my hands on some more Graeters again!",

If you're part of their rewards program, you get a free sundae the week of your birthday! I now live in St. Louis, but I made the trip to Cincinnati for a week of celebrations and you bet Graeter's had to be included! I miss having them nearby! Their ice cream is delicious and the chocolate chips are more like chocolate chunks (I've found some the size of my palm). So it's not surprising that my favorite flavors all have chocolate chips - Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip, Coconut Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, Black Cherry Chocolate Chip, Toffee Chocolate Chip, Mocha Chocolate Chip. That's what awesome about Graeter's - it's not a place where I get stuck getting the same flavor every time. There are so many great ones that I can switch it up every time! They also have some fantastic seasonal flavors - currently they have the cinnamon (which is one of my favorites because it takes like a snickerdoodle cookie) and pumpkin!\n\nThere are Graeter's all over the city. So no matter what part of town you're in, you can always find one near by. Thank goodness!",

I normally don't think it's appropriate to call people out like this but I'm fed up with what I see every time I'm there. Please don't take this lightly. I saw both of you speak down to a young man working tonight 9/27/19 in a way that made me sick. He looked like he was on the verge of tears. No one deserves to be treated that way.

It's not the best I've ever had (by a long shot), but it's ice cream that tastes like what your grandma would have made for you on a hot summer day (if my grandma could make ice cream...). It's rich and creamy, which is what you want in ice cream. My only qualm is that the fruit flavors taste so artificial. Is it so awful slash difficult to have strawberry that actually tastes like strawberries? \n\nThe best part about Graeter's is the chocolate chip part. Haha, they should just call it _(insert flavor here)__ Ginormous Block of Chocolate. Doesn't quite have the same ring to it though. But unearthing the whole block is probably my favorite Graeter's pasttime. I think I need new hobbies. \n\nDo I like anything there? Actually, there are a couple of flavors that I look for when I'm at Mejier, shopping the ice cream aisle which I will buy if they're on sale. Cookies n' Cream, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, and Buckeye Blitz. They're always winners in my book.",

It was a Friday, early evening, and the place was nearly empty. (One other party of 2 was there.) My friend didn't know what she wanted so she took extra time checking out the menu and trying 2 flavors. The staff member helping us was not friendly and seemed almost annoyed. She never offered suggestions and just stared at us. \n\nI ended up getting the low gylcemic mint chocolate chip. My biggest complaint about Graeter's in general is it's too heavy and sugary. This option was a great choice for me! Tasted great and light. Thankfully I don't have a nut allergy because somehow mine ended up with a chunk of walnut(?) right in the middle. The staff must not have really cleaned up the scoop well enough I guess. \n\nAlso the place had a serious mildew smell. I could hardly stand by the counter and could even smell it while sitting inside. I would have gone out if it wasn't raining at the time. The sponge that they use to smack off the water from the scoops did not look good. It just did not seem sanitary. \n\nI would have given a 1 star if not for the ice cream. I'll keep to generally avoiding this branch in the future.",

The folks working there are always nice. \nI am not in love with the interior so I usually just order and leave. For some reason it feels like a place where they'd hose down prisoners before taking them to their cell.

Their vanilla is solid, hot fudge sauce good and serving sizes generous. What I found most interesting was their whipped cream, which appears to be made by whipping air in manually as you would if you made it at home rather than charging a tank with nitrous oxide.\n\nBe advised what they call 'chocolate chip' is really more like 'chocolate ribbon'. Their chip flavors have chewy ribbons of chocolate in them, rather than chunks or (my ideal) flakes. For the uninitiated, chocolate chip ice cream is made by pouring molten chocolate in the cold ice cream as it is being spun in the machine. The hardness, consistency and size of the chips are adjusted by the temperatures of the ice cream and chocolate being poured in. Personally, I like tiny, crisp flakes of chocolate. Graeter's is fine, just different.\n\nI've been back a couple times. It's worth the trip when visiting Cincinnati.",

I was promised \"the best ice cream you'll ever have.\" As with most expectations, I went in skeptical, but boy was I surprised! Her statement was 100% correct. Graeter's is the smoothest, creamiest, most flavorful ice cream I've ever had. I regularly come back time and again. The black raspberry chip is my consistent favorite, but I've recently been branching out to the Black Cherry Chip. The seasonal flavors are always great, and they provide a good excuse to return regularly (as if you needed that). I should qualify my statement on best ice cream: My wife is certainly the aficionado in the family when it comes to ice cream, and she sees a plethora of criteria and seems to be impressed with subtle distinctions. While I respect that, I'm pretty basic when it comes to what I like: It has to have amazing constantly and incredible flavor. If those two things are there, I'm happy. Unfortunately, SO MUCH ice cream fails one or both of these criteria. Graeter's not only satisfies both of these; it exceeds them. If you are feeling like doing some ready, look up the French Pot method they have used since the mid 19th century to make the ice cream; it's fascinating. Graeter's will always be my local go-to when it comes to dessert. I also have a friend out of town who pays $$$ to have it shipped across the country for his parties, so you know it must be good.

Whats stopping you?!  If its Oprahs favorite thing, you at least have to see what all the fuss is about!\n\nThis is my favorite location for Graters!!  The store is on the corner of Ludlow and Telford, and is also on the 17 and 19 bus stop!  When you walk inside, there is an entire retail/bakery section where you can get fresh baked goods, chocolates and even some souvenirs to send to others who are missing out.  I especially love the eat in at the several tables they have set up, which always have flowers or something in the center just to jazz it up.  I also love how much detail the servers put into making somethign as simple as a sundae.  No joke, last night I ordered a sundae with raspberry toppings, whipped-cream, nutts and a cherry and this man looked like he was painting a Picaso.  Even the people behind us said how it looked jsut like the picture on the wall (which by the way, if you have not seen, they have giant framed photos of their ice cream all over which is awesome and kind of over the top/hilarious all in one).  \n\nCheck it out, especially at this location!  There is always a line which tells me people keep coming back for more!",

I shared a with my husband- we got a double cup with toffee chip and peanut butter chip.  I preferred the toffee chip to the peanut butter. \n-1 star for the service and the odd taste of the gelato I tried.  I asked if I could sample the hazelnut gelato and frankly I thought it was nasty.  It had a very weird aftertaste.  I asked if I could try the peanut butter chip and got such a nasty look that I hesitated to try a different one.  We guessed with the toffee (didn't sample it), and I ended up loving it more than the peanut butter.  Our one cup with 2 scoops ended up being just over $4 (a little pricey but it was good).  It really was delicious- I was only going to have a couple bites but ended up eating half of the cup we shared.",

This is my first time here in town and I had no clue what/where to go.  Upon asking a local waitress, she was adamant that I must try 2 places in town, Skyline's Chili and Graeter's Ice Cream.\n\nI tried the Black Raspberry Chip and Black Cherry Chip.  It did not disappoint.  The flavor/texture is unique.  It was pretty good.  However the chocolate chips were huge chunks and I think due to the ice cream making processes, sometimes it'll break it up into small pieces, which I like better.  So that's the only issue with it, but I sure there are other people that may favor it more.  Just my preference... \n\nJust saw Graeter's ice cream at the grocery store! And just couldn't help myself from purchasing some.",

A little too sweet for my taste though, and I think they definitely could've done more with the mixed-in pie crust -- it was honestly a little bland. A graham cracker or a heavy shortbread crust would've been perfect.\n\nThe malt ball (I kept thinking this was \"moth ball\" when everyone was talking about it, hoho!) ice cream that I sampled was pretty durned good though.  I'll probably get this the next time I'm at Graeter's.",

      "text": "The Good: THE BEST ICECREAM IN THE WORLD. Seriously I have yet to have one that tops the almost all variety's of Graeters (and I've had a lot of ice cream around the us/world). My absolute favorite is the mint chip. I'm saddened at the fact they took out the green food coloring because that was the only \"unnatural\" part of a brand that is going 100% natural. People eat with their eyes, this is almost as devastating to me as Pepsi Clear was back in the 90's.\n\nThe Bad: It's all the way in Cincinnati, I can have it shipped that's a hell of an expensive way to keep myself fat. This place is also bad because I get very greedy and don't like to share my Graeter's.\n\nThe Ugly: I eat this stuff by the pint other than the sheer amount of saturated fats and calories I intake I grew to be lactose intolerant a year or so ago. I power through it, lactase doesn't seem to help (and I've had 3 of them before a binge).\n\nAnother note about Graeters where I am extremely upset is they got rid of the classic yellow cake with vanilla ice cream. This was topped with fudge and aside from their mint chip my favorite dessert hands down. If I were to be on death row for my last meal I would request Graeter's for my dessert.\n\nOn a plus note I hear they'll be distributing Graeter's across all Krogers. Sadly they don't have on in Chicago, but I'm proud that my hometown Icecream is expanding their operation and going national (I just hope this doesn't compromise quality).",

I briefly remember reading about this chain and I equated the high price with quality.  As soon as I picked up the pint I knew it had a high butterfat content based on the weight.  I chose plain old vanilla with chocolate chips.  All I can say is that it is average in taste in the super premium ice cream category.  I actually think Haagen Daz tastes better.  For those folks who think Blue Bell is better, you must have a taste bud deficit. Blue Bell should be called ice milk because it has so much less butterfat than the premium brands.  When you weigh a pint of BB to Graeter's it is not even close.  You actually think that half the pint is missing from BB.  Bottom line, you will really like the taste of Graeter's but it is by no means worth the ultra premium price of $5.39 a pint.  I will stick with Haagen Daz when their sale price is $2.50 each (yes I know it's 14 ounces now). Still half the price of Graeter's and much better taste.",

I actually love it so much that I made it a point to come to this particular Graeter's location because it is their oldest standing location (Est 1922!). Such a Cincinnati staple!\n\nI had been near this Graeter's last summer when I was in town for the Hyde Park Blast, which takes place right in Hyde Park Square. I never made it that night, but I always wanted to go back (I live in Columbus, so not the quickest drive to get here!). I ended up going with my family after a trip at the Cincinnati Zoo this summer.\n\nThis Graeter's is smaller than every other Graeter's I've been to-- but the scoops and delicious flavors are all the same! I got the new birthday cake flavor with some chocolate in a waffle cone. Always such a treat. \n\nI also love how you can tell right away that this is a vintage Graeter's. The signage up front makes you feel like it hasn't been touched since the 1930's (it may even be the original 1920's signage!). I love all things vintage so to be able to go to this Graeter's was a special field trip for me. \n\nKeep serving up those delicious flavors, Graeter's! You make Cincinnati proud! I hope to get back to this location again one day!",

This location is cute and has fun little items inside like cookies, ice cream cakes, ice cream pints, and etc. I also like this location as it's nice to be able to stop by after or while walking around Hyde Park. \n\nI got one scoop of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. This was my favorite ice cream flavor growing up, so I wanted a scoop of my old classic. It was really good. The only thing I didn't like was the huge chucks of chocolate in it. They were definitely bigger than the dough and chocolate chip size. It was some what over powering. More like it was chocolate chip ice cream rather than chocolate chip cookie dough. I would be chewing and get huge chunks of chocolate pieces. I like chocolate but sheesh. It wasn't what I was use to. \n\nOverall, Graeter's has good ice cream and I enjoy their ice cream from any of their locations.",

      "text": "America is a nation of immigrants. Even the Indians by land and the Vikings by sea! Cincinnati's two oldest hand crafted ice cream stores were started by immigrants. German immigrants started Graeter's in 1868, selling it at the Court Street Market. That would be about the same time my German relatives moved to Over the Rhine, and shopped at that same neighborhood market. \n\nThis location is the oldest Graeter's in it's original location. \n\nMy grandmother and her sisters were always Graeter's loyalists, this was their neighborhood store, and I'm sure they knew the family. Of course, my mother had to show her independence and support \"the other\" ice cream business in Oakley! \n\nGrowing up, Graeter's ice cream was reserved for special occasions. Graeter's also makes Winter holiday tea cookie collections which are unique and excellent. \n\nGraeter's ice cream is stiff, dense and sweet. Their vanilla bean is my go-to ice cream and stands the test of generations. \n\nThis store has a few taller bar type tables and overlooks the Square. The benches on the Square is a great place to enjoy your ice cream too!\n\nThe staff was great. Of course one of the best things about Graeter's are their many branches all over the city. And in December, keep an eye out for their cookie assortments. They are almost as good as the ones my German grandmother and her sisters made!",

My first recommendation came from TSA in the Tampa International Airport ... the Cincinnati native couldn't resist telling me to make a stop... so that alone may have set my expectations to high... \n\nEither way- I love the area, the shop, and the wonderful service... did not LOVE the ice cream. It wasn't bad but it wasn't really special in anyway. I had the Brownie Sunday with Coffee & Vanilla ice cream (& ate all of it, so no its not bad)... but wouldn't be particularly interested in coming back or raving about it. \n\nPerhaps, as some other reviews state- there is no need for toppings? May need to come back for just a scoop of the coffee ice cream to truly appreciate the ice cream here! \n\nDefinitely an old fashioned shop with refreshingly kind staff so I will give them another try! Its great to see the support in the community for this shop so 100% will be back!",

It was my favorite and absolutely amazing. The chips were actually big, solid chunks of goodness. I also had a scoop of the Buckeye Blitz. Yep, loved the Buckeyes.  I am so glad I got the black raspberry. It's by far my favorite ice cream combo ever! To make the experience even more amazing, my cone was a pretzel cone! Wow! Because Graeder's uses the French pot method, ice makers produce the ice cream in very small batches, by hand, daily!\n\nTwo totally amazing happenings due to this adventure? I found a cute area of town I'd love to explore further.  The homes were cute and the area surrounding the ice cream shop was like a park and I think it had wi-fi. There were lots of little shops. Another cool thing? They also have candy, including buckeye chocolates.  I was very happy to see them because I had originally bought some at Jungle Joe's to take home to my family but SOMEONE ate them! (blushing a little) First, the guy gave me a free sample of one to see if I approved and then I bought a box.  To be honest, the ones at Jungle Jims were way better in my opinion.  They were mushier. But the Graeter one's were fancy, nice thick chocolatey shell and clean peanut butter. Much better for gift giving as far as professional packaging and presentation go.",

      "text": "***Graeter's is a longstanding ice cream brand out of Cincinnati; it has several locations throughout the city and is sold at some of Cincinnati's popular restaurants like Montgomery inn; it is more of an old fashioned ice cream parlor like Baskin-Robbins and Fosselman's than the newer artisan spots like Ohio-based Jeni's; Graeter's is a satisfying ice cream spot, but you will be able to find more interesting as well as more delicious ice cream flavors elsewhere***\n\nGraeter's is one of Cincinnati's (as well as Ohio's) most well known ice cream brands.  Its popularity is due to its long history in Cincinnati (it has been around since the late 1800s), its availability at popular and longstanding Cincinnati restaurants like Montgomery Inn, and its signature and not found everywhere flavor black raspberry chip.  Graeter's has moved beyond Cincinnati.  They have other locations throughout Ohio and pints of a few of their flavors are now available at Ralphs locations in California.\n\nGraeter's is an old fashioned ice cream parlor with mostly traditional hand scoped flavors and throwback sundaes and desserts like banana split.  They have gotten a little more modern with some seasonal and more interesting flavors though Graeter's is still a lot like places such as Fosselman's and Baskin-Robbins.\n\nI tried three of their flavors.  I went with one of their seasonal flavors--strawberry chip.  It was good.  The strawberry ice cream had the right amount of sweetness and tartness.  The chocolate chips were also good, thick and rich.  They have a lot of other chocolate chip flavors.  Their black raspberry chip is popular, but I find the ice cream base on that flavor too tart.\n\nI also had their Elena's blueberry pie.  This flavor was quite strong.  The blueberry flavor really came across--like very potent blueberry pie filling.  There were also crisp shortbread-like cookies in the ice cream (kind of like pie pastry).  I thought the flavor was pretty good and some would probably really like it.  I am not sure if I would get it again though.\n\nI also had the caramel and this was average.  It did not have the complexity of the more contemporary salted caramel flavors.  It also did not have the richness or sweet flavor of a really good caramel.\n\nThe consistency of the ice cream was good but not great.  It was creamy and smooth and was not icy.  The ice cream though did lack the denseness and creaminess of the really good artisan ice cream now available at shops like Sweet Rose Creamery, Bi-Rite Creamery, Three Twins, Jeni's, and Carmela.\n\nPrices were good.  Graeter's is more of a big scoop place so you do not get the variety of flavors in a smaller serving size like Carmela or some gelato shops; however, the portion sizes on scoops are very generous.\n\nService was okay--polite though not as friendly as other places I visited in the Cincinnati area.\n\nGraeter's is worth trying at least once due its popularity and long history.  I find it just okay compared to the newer and more upscale gourmet ice cream shops (like Jeni's in Ohio), but with Graeter's many ice cream flavors, sundaes, toppings, and shakes, I think most will be able to find something they like here.\n\nThis Graeter's is located in the charming and quaint Hyde Park Square shopping district and you can find metered street parking and free street parking in the nearby residential area.",

Graeter's ice cream is creamy (not icy), sweet, and delicious! Their ingredients are basic-- whole milk, cream, sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and milk from cows not treated with rBST. Their ice cream is not organic, but mostly free of chemicals and dyes. Warning-- you may leave with a coating of fat on the roof of your mouth! Oh, but it's so delicious! \nMy favorite flavors are mocha (coffee) chip & black raspberry chip! My sister loves the blueberry pie flavor! But you can't go wrong with any of the flavors! They do have several flavors of the month, and they will let you taste as many as you'd like! The ones with chocolate chunks are the best! The chocolate melts in your mouth, and the chunks are huge! I love the sorbets, sodas, and sundaes too! Most of their toppings (caramel, hot fudge, whipped cream) are made by Graeter's. Although, I'm not a fan of the new gelatos; I think that they are too sweet (weird, I know!)\nMost of the locations evoke an old-fashioned soda shop feel. This location is fun in the summer because you can grab your ice cream and sit in Hyde Park square to eat it! The store itself is small, but does have a good number of tables and chairs. They also sell homemade candy, cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. The icing on their birthday cakes is the very sugary, thick kind-- I love it because it's not whippy or chemical-tasting! \nIf you're in Cincinnati, you HAVE to try Graeter's. Heck, they even sell it in most grocery stores across the country now! (Thank heaven or I'd go through withdrawls!)",

I don't know why they think they need pastries and doughnuts, but it seems other people do, and that's fine. \n\nI will stick with the ice cream.\n\nThis is where my German genetics get their big hipped/hourglass propensities from, I think.

Any other black raspberry chips pale in comparison.  I also love the mint chocolate chip and appreciate that it is naturally colored and white with no artificial color. I also love the strawberry, a burst of fruity deliciousness so when I discovered June's flavor of the month is strawberry chocolate chip I was all over it.

They use the traditional french pot way of making it, which incorporates less air and gives it a much richer taste and thicker consistency that most ice cream makers don't use. It's more expensive than regular ice cream but you get what you pay for and the portion sizes are large. If you're visiting Cincinnati, please stop by this place, you won't regret it! I recommend the double chocolate chip, vanilla, and my personal favorite, the black raspberry chocolate chip!

      "text": "Does Graeter's Ice Cream qualify as an institution of greatness?  Very debatable.  From an outsider's perspective that is newer to the area, one can see the strong redeeming qualities of the ice cream itself, but I love it when a community absolutely embraces a Company like Graeter's, makes it their own, and then adds so much more to said Company's reputation of greatness.  If you speak bad about Graeter's around these parts, it could be fighting words, so tread lightly.  I love it.  \n\nI unfortunately feel the need to go to far too many ice cream shops wherever I live, and Graeter's is no exception.  I think they do a fine job of making a quality product back at the \"mother ship\" (wherever that may be here locally), yet I think there is something, and I'm not sure what it is, missing at Graeter's that takes the quality to that \"stratospheric level\".  First, and most importantly, they don't pass the \"WOW\" test.  I've never tasted their product and said to myself \"there is something so unique about this - something so good - that I can't get it elsewhere\".   And before anyone says \"well, what about the Black Raspberry?\", let me stop you; yes, it can be found elsewhere.  Secondly, there is something of the \"soft\" variety that is missing that would make it great (for ME).  When I think of a true homemade ice cream place, I think of a friendly and knowledgeable staff (usually family of the proprietor or just a real \"go-getter\" employee, not a bunch of eager high school students), brown cartons that hold ice cream that can't be re-used and unique flavors that aren't just there to appease a large audiences from across the land and aren't artificially colored (i.e. like banana ice cream that looks more like the color of a highlighter).  This one may sound Hokie to you - I almost expect a flavor in the case that is like \"why in the world would the owner carry this?\" - something like a Rum Raisin -  when you look at it, it's clearly one of the owner's hobby and doesn't sell a lot, but he or she likes their guilty pleasure on display so they can justify eating it often by selling a cup from time-to-time.  So, I'm giving you a lot of qualities that would make a 5 star ice cream shop for me, which clearly Graeter's doesn't qualify for.  \n\nWhat they do qualify with me is a very happy customer.  One that enjoys the convenience of their locations and appreciates the quality of their mass produced product.  My only gripes with their locations is that they do lack on friendly customer service, but I get that you are going to get that when you employ a lot of high school kids.  Some are either going to go that extra mile for management, and others aren't, and unfortunately at a place like Graeter's you can't really hide someone that has a less-than-stellar customer service - there are only so many tasks to be done.    \n\nTry the 1870 Tower!  Also, we tried the new Less Indulgent ice cream they are offering (I believe it's new), and it's fantastic - worth the try for your in home freezer and it's less calories!",

I can't, with decent scruples, leave this ice cream joint review-less, especially after my review of that other ice cream joint in Oakley... \n\nYes, Graeter's is brilliant..!!! The Black Raspberry Chip, the Mocha Chocolate Chip and the Toffee Chip are absolutely three of my favorite flavors of ice cream in Cincinnati... And, that's sayin' something considering how big an Ice Cream Town Cincy is...\n\nAnd, this location is definitely my favorite... Beechmont is ok, so are Ludlow, Walnut, Kenwood, Wooster and The Florence store, but I just enjoy the staff and location in Hyde Park more... Nothing personal... Maybe it's because I like walking out to the Erie Ave sitting park after I receive my cone or cup... Just sayin'...",

      "text": "There are many Graeter's locations across the city of Cincinnati, but this is by far my favorite. This one is set in adorable Hyde Park Square near the beautiful fountain in the center. The inside features cute ice cream chairs and tables, a beautiful tile floor, and tall ceilings. There is just something about it that is much nicer than most other cookie cutter locations. On a nice day you can see people get their ice cream and then go sit by the fountain. I used to come to the square and get ice cream a lot after school.\n\nNow the ice cream is not to be messed with! It is some of the best ice cream in the country in my opinion. When I was living in Boston, I actually had some shipped to me! The chocolate chunks are the best part. If you've never had the ice cream before, then start with a \"chip\" flavor. They have a special way of making the chocolate chunks so that they don't freeze in the ice cream and they melt in your mouth.\n\nYou can get Graeter's ice cream at any location in the city, but I recommend going to this one for the sheer experience!",

      "text": "The Graeter's in Hyde Park was my dessert location of choice after eating a burger at Arthur's around the corner. I had read the Yelp reviews and was pretty eager to dig into some lovely 'scream when I went in. I was sort of in-the-middle in terms of my opinion of this place.\n\nOn the one hand, Graeter's is really good. There's no denying it. I had coconut chip and my friend Randy had black raspberry chip (which was better than the coconut, I thought), they were both pretty good. It was pretty solid and old school and the chips in both were fudgy and so didn't suffer from the ailment of most chips in ice cream that can get crazy hard and flavorless and become annoying. \n\nOn the other hand, it just wasn't particularly spectacular. It was sort of an experience that I would say is super locally, but on the national scale (which because I was driving from TX to CT when I ate there I was thinking of it on), it's not really up there with the best I've been to. \n\nGraeter's is really good, very solid. And if you grew up on it, or live in Cincy I'm sure it defines Ice Cream for the region. Pretty neat place!",

It was wind chill of about zero the other night but this place was across the street from my hotel and he said it was a must have.  I don't eat a lot of ice cream. Tend to stick to healthy stuff.  Had a few samples including their signature black raspberry chip. They all tasted good to the tiny sampler spoon.\nI landed on a scoop of coconut chip. They convinced me to add another scoop for 50 cents so I could enjoy two flavors. $4 for two big scoops. Good deal. Easy decision. I added blueberry pie, which actually has pie crust blended in.\nI enjoyed the coconut chip more.  This ice cream is dense, creamy and very good.  The best I have ever had. No. But no complaints! It was delicious and worth the calories. And no, I didn't finish it all demonstrating great willpower.\nThe staff was awesome. They were ultra friendly and brought me over some pamphlets since I told them it was my first trip to Graeter's. \nMy friend here in Dallas (from Cincinnati) said it was available at the local supermarket, Central Market, in pints. Pints are never as good as hand dipped but if we need some ice cream in the future, good to know it is available locally.",

And I'm pretty sure if Jesus came down to earth, he would say it's the best too. \n\nApparently they use a french pot process to make the actual ice cream. I don't know what's french about it but hats off to the fine folks of France for perfecting ice cream. After that, the word on the street is, they pour a layer of liquid dark chocolate over the finished product, let it cool, and then break it up into the ice cream resulting in massively delicious chunks of chocolate. And that is what makes Graeter's so money - the chocolate. Black Rasperry Chip is the most popular but I think any \"chip\" flavor is incredible.\n\nIf you've never been and you live in the area, you should drop what you're doing and beeline it to your nearest Graeter's.

The store is small in and in the summer time seating is at a premium but the square is right across the way and is a great place to take your treat on the go. There are also benches outside as well to sit at and people watch. \n\nYou just cant go wrong with black raspberry chip, or any ice cream that has their signature chocolate chips in them. I try to stray and try different flavors but I never do, I always come back to the black raspberry chip. I am drawn to it like a moth to the flame. There is also an area that sells other treats such as buckeyes, candy's, donuts, cakes and seasonal items like chocolate eggs around Easter. \n\nThis is probably my favorite Graeters location of the few that I have been to and most definitely worth your time if you are in the area. You will probably end up having some shipped to you after you start going through withdrawal.",

      "text": "Normally, I like to mix things up. However, when it comes to Graeter's, I will always order one of two things:\n\nThe Blueberry Pie ice cream\nRaspberry Sorbet with Lemonade\n\nLet's start with the Blueberry pie. Now, while the back story is a bit of a tear jerker (there was a little girl with an illness who designed this ice cream, it was only seasonal but since she died they keep it on the menu full-time donating the profits to research), the ice cream is so different than anything else. There are actually chunks of pie crusts in the ice cream. And they don't get soggy, they stay crunchy! And I don't normally like blueberries but the ones in this ice cream are delicious!\n\nThe raspberry sorbet with lemonade is perfect for summer. You can grab one of these and wander over to Hyde Park square and enjoy a nice summer day. \n\nI have also enjoyed any of the ice creams with chocolate chunks, but only when other people get them (I am not above mooching ice cream). As for the other things Graeter's offer, like chocolates, can't say I have ever had them or remember having them. But who needs chocolate when the ice cream is this good.",

And The Boss smoothie will keep your lips glued to the straw as you inhale pulverized chocolate bits.\n\nBut don't forget their baked goods! Before Lent, they sell the best paczki in the city. Their cheese crowns have a surprise cinnamon filling (which I guess is no longer a surprise). If you're looking for an upscale bakery good, definitely consider Graeter's.\n\nThis Hyde Park location is great for those who live nearby, but parking is rather difficult. In nice weather, it's lovely to take your treat across the street to the square.",

      "text": "So I pretty much love ice cream. It's just plain delicious. I've also worked at two different ice cream shops in the past back in my Indiana hometown, so I like to think that I know my ice cream. \n\nSo when I first moved to Cincinnati and heard of the mystical Graeters that had the \"best ice cream ever\", I had to try it. Not going to lie- my first time, I wasn't convinced. Second time-ok, but nothing special. The only reason I kept going back was that my boyfriend thought it was pretty much the greatest thing in the entire world. He kept telling me, \"But Steph, it's French pot! Do you know how much work it takes to make this kind of ice cream?!\" So after many trips with him, it sort of started to grow on me. Then, the other night, I found myself craving it. What does this mean?!\n\nSo I guess I'm a convert. Graeters is well known for its chip flavors- black raspberry chip being on the most popular flavors. Personally, I'm more of a peanut butter chip gal. But, not matter what flavor you choose, you can delight in huge, delicious chocolate chips. Graeters also has a great selection of seasonal flavors- pumpkin, peppermint, mint cookies and cream. \n\nThe Hyde Park location is my favorite. According to my boyfriend, they give the largest portions. While haven't weighed out the proportions, I think the location on the Square has a whole lot of charm. I also love how you can window shop at the boutiques while eating. There is always a good crowd and the staff is excellent. \n\nGraeters is a Cincinnati tradition, just like flying pigs and Skyline chili. You just absolutely have to try it if you are passing through town.",

They have a great selection of seasonal flavors as well, they fit well with what the weather has you craving at that time. The stores themselves are often small and quaint, if you plan to stay in I'd suggest a sweater or something for people who get cold easily.\n\nA Graeter's addiction seems to form for many in Cincinnati, this includes my family. For a time in grade school I would have a sundae every day after school. It made the days go by faster and always gave me something to look forward too.

      "text": "The frozen yogurt is amazing and way better than orange leaf/ menchies. Their customer service not so much, i love the taste of Yagoot but the way they treat customers makes me want to take my business else where. \nThe first time we came the customers didn't care for us, not friendly or helpful really. Just recently (6/7/2021) my boyfriend and I walked into their store at 9:05. The sign on their door said \"open\" we took 2 steps inside and the dirty blonde head worker said we are closed and turned us down. Then turned down the 3 girls behind us. They were still serving one other customers. I understand that we came in 5 minutes after they \"closed\", but with the door being unlocked and the sign saying open, I feel as if they should've served us. We did drive 40 minutes in order to get Yagööt, but first had to make a stop at REI. I know that I have the ability to look up store hours, but when a restaurant says \"Open\", the doors are unlocked, and they are serving customers, you think you will also be served. It would be different if the door was locked, or if the sign at least said closed. \n\nLike I said great ice cream, but management really need to train workers on customer service. I feel as if this business will only stay open because they are different from other frozen yogurt places. They would make more revenue if their staff was friendly and put customers first, wanting their customers to came back.",

The place is still neat, and can't complain about the service. \nI got a medium pistachio one with fresh raspberries and chocolate chips. It was really good!

I didn't eat lunch and wanted something semi healthy so I decided to give them a try. I had also never heard of them, so I was curious. I was happy I gave them a try. The inside is super welcoming and colorful. It puts you in a good, happy mood. \n\nI tried their Straw-Nana Smoothie. Yes, it's a strawberry-banana smoothie. I added amino acids to my smoothie. The base is milk and yogurt. I enjoyed the smoothie and thought it had a good taste. It tasted like what it was supposed to and nothing about it was overwhelming. It was well balanced.This was definitely a good, quick on-the-go snack. \n\nOverall, Yagööt has good smoothies or at least a good Strawberry-Banana smoothie. I would definitely come back for this smoothie if I was near one (they have more than this location) or in the Rookwood area.",

It's very tart, almost sour. The taste is amazing.  It's kind of like a frozen Greek yogurt.  The great thing is that it's kind of healthy too.  They put the toppings on for you, but don't worry they put just the right amount. \n\nI recommend getting a parfait or a smoothie.  If you get the cups, you end up paying the same amount as a parfait but you get less.  With a parfait, you can pick up to 4 yogurt flavors and 3 toppings.  The smoothie is yogurt blended up with a few toppings.  I really like the original yogurt with fruit blended up in a smoothie.  It tastes just as good as a parfait and you can still taste all the flavors.  \n\nSome of my favorite toppings are yomance and the mini peanut butter cups.  Yomance is a mixture of dark chocolate crunchy ball things and pink yogurt chips.  \n\nThey also have a rewards program.  Give them your number so you can sign up. You get a free menu item after spending a certain amount.",

The yogurt had the perfect amount of tang and subtle sweetness, and they were really generous with the toppings. The yogurt here is great because it's not overly sweetened like it can tend to be at a lot of other places, so it ends up being pretty refreshing. And because it's yogurt, I didn't feel horrible after eating it! Overall, great product here, and will definitely be back!",

All of the yogurt flavors are extremely tart/tangy (like \"original\" froyo usually is). The cake batter yogurt had no cake batter flavor at all.  You also do not get to scoop your own toppings, and my cup was made while I was still ordering, so I ended up with toppings overflowing when I would have preferred less of some things and more of other things. It seems like you can only get 3 toppings, but I'm not sure.  It also seems very pricey (there are set prices, it's not by weight).\nIt seems a lot of people like this place but it wasn't for me. Objectively, the store was clean and the people were nice.",

Still, I go for dessert whenever I'm at Rookwood getting Qdoba or going to Whole Foods.\n\nMy favorite flavors are Italian cocoa and coconut, but they are both seasonal, sadly. Otherwise, I usually just get plain with Oreos. They have various fruit and candy toppings similar to other yogurt places or Cold Stone. They usually have six flavors of yogurt with original (plain), strawberry, and original/strawberry swirl always three of the options.\n\nThe yogurt is a bit tart and not rich like ice cream. It's thick and creamy, though, so it satisfies the need for naughty things just enough without making you feel overindulged. 120 calories for a small plain. 150-190 calories for most of the flavors.\n\nThe decor is bright, colorful, and whimsical. I enjoy spaces that sort of wake up your brain from the white blahness of so many places.",

They are a great deal- the size of maybe a medium (plus some) and 3 toppings whipped together. And adding protein powder makes it a meal. \n\nThe inside is small and not meant to house groups but, there is plenty of benches/stone edging to sit on outside the store (they put pads out during the summer to make them comfy).",

The best part is that they have two staples--original and strawberry--and the other flavors rotate seasonally.  A food for your mood!\n\nSo if you've never actually had yagoot I feel obligated to describe the experience to you.  Yagoot is not like your orange leave or DQ soft serve.  When they say it's frozen yogurt, it truly is frozen yogurt.  It's not overly sugary sweet and it's tart and creamy too--I find it to be best complimented by one of their many fruit toppings--chopped fresh daily!  I have so many favorite combos, most of which include the alligator crunch topping which is HEAVENLY.  It's a combo of nuts, coconut and brown sugar and goes so great on everything.  I love it on the seasonal pumpkin.  It's also amazing on the white peach during summer with strawberries.  My mouth is watering as we speak.\n\nSo, try it.  It's local, everything is made from scratch, and it's a taste so unique you have to try it to understand it.  Isn't it intriguing?  Go go go!",

Each of them are a little tart the way you'd expect yogurt to be. And they still have a plethora of great toppings to choose from.\n\nYou aren't charged by the weight, but rather the size of the serving you choose.\n\nAaaand, it's not self-serve, so you never have to try not to trip over a dozen kids running around trying every flavor. But they'll still let you sample whatever you want!\n\nI was surprised by how good Yagoot was compared to it's competitors. What a great, relatively healthy dessert. Love it!",

      "text": "My best advice is give this place more than one try. The first time I went I was not ready for the tart flavor of the frozen yogurt. \n\nI've since learned the reason for the tartness--the yogurt is real and healthy and even the flavorings are natural and carefully selected.  I've been impressed at how fresh the fruit toppings are each time I go in. Though, My favorite topping, I have to confess, is the completely unhealthy busken crunch. It's a blend of nuts, coconut and brown sugar.  \n\nThe original flavor with a set of toppings is delicious. However my favorite flavor of yogurt is caramelized pineapple. So delicious, no toppings needed. \n\nBeware! The stuff is addicting. It quickly became a pregnancy craving for me. I almost can't believe I'm saying this but I prefer it to ice cream on a hot summer night, because it just tastes fresh.\n\nIt's a little pricey but worth the splurge. Every now and then they give away buy one get one free coupons and if you sign up to be a \"ya groupie\" they usually send an email with the monthly special or free taste test of a new flavor.",

I thought I'd seen it all with yogurt, but Yagoot is in a league of its own.\n\nMy mom and I were on a day-long shopping excursion (had just spent 3 hours in ONE store, it's true ... sad, but true) and we were plumb tuckered from all that exertion. We'd missed lunch but didn't want to fill up before dinner so started brainstorming about quick stops, something that didn't come from a place with the double arches. \n\nYagoot was across the street. She hadn't been but told me she thought the flavors were mostly tart. I've gone that route at a place near me in DC and never found it particularly satisfying, puckering my mouth at every bite and missing out on the smooth and creamy that always makes my frozen treat experience. I started doubting that this was really the right choice, but when we started rattling off our other options and where we'd have to drive to get them, Yagoot it was.\n\nThank goodness! Every flavor was divine, I couldn't make up my mind. She let us sample whatever we wanted and I didn't throw a lick of any sample in the trash, even when I knew I was getting my own little cup. Which, I must say, was inhaled nearly the second she put it in my hand.  I had nooooo trouble with the small. I elected plain topped with strawberries and raspberries, my mom went with pistachio with their signature sugared-nut topping.\n\nAs we were leaving I noticed that the \"shake\" seems to be the popular choice - there's always next time!",

I first fell in love with this luscious treat one summer after spending all day at the pool. It's the perfect combination of refreshing and tart. I always recommend to my friends that they start out basic when trying Yagoot for the first time; which means small original plus fruit. I personally have tried a number of the seasonal flavors and continue to go back to the original flavor. Depending on my mood, I will switch up between blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. \n\nThe staff is always patient and willing to let you sample different flavors. The shop has plenty of space to eat in or sit outside on benches. This stuff is addictive once you get your personal go to combination down. I try to limit myself to small since it's on the pricey side but alas sometimes I cave and go for a larger size. Enjoy!",

During the summer, the White Peach flavor has a sweet and sour taste that speaks to the palate and in the winter you get unique flavors like Pomegranate, Pumpkin Spice and Italian Cocoa. What is unique about Yagoot is the fact that their toppings are prepared fresh on a daily basis. Therefore you don't have to worry about anything that might be borderline spoiled. They have a number of interesting combination toppings like Alligator Crunch (an unique take on cereal and coconut) and Chocolate Chips. The crew is very nice and very generous with the portions of toppings. It is a colorful setting and very family friendly. If you want a healthy treat and great outing in the Cincinnati area, come down to the Rookwood Yagoot!",

It is real yogurt so it is naturally tart. Like everyone else is saying, you really can't describe it. You just have to try it.\n\nThe restaurant itself is trendy and modern and feels like something out of the Jetsons.  You walk up to a bar of goodies and choose from about 4 different types of flavors to start. Then you get your \"add ons\" Each add on is an additional price. Some people go crazy and get fruity pebbles, chocolate chips, coconut, and everything in between! \n\nMy boyfriend and I kept it simple. I had the peach yogurt with granola which tasted EXACTLY like a peach snapple. It was sooooo good. When he asked if we wanted a pint, I looked at Justin and said lets run!!! I'm already \"one of them\". You know, those scary people that are addicted. Now I know why! \n\nMy boyfriend got the strawberry yogurt with kiwi. Yes, I said kiwi. As in freshly diced kiwi on his yogurt. Does it get any better than that? Or healthier? I don't think so. If you are in the mood for a cool treat but don't really like sweets this is the place to be.

If, like me, your sweet tooth is somewhat limited, or you prefer your sweets to be not too awful for you, then head to Yagoot. Now. That's an order!\n\nThe yogurt here is not sweet; it's sort of tangy, rather than saccharine. As such, it provides the perfect base for the many fruit, nut, and sweet toppings. Generally, Yagoot keeps 2-3 flavors of Yagoot in stock: original, chocolate, and something seasonal (coffee, pumpkin, pistachio, banana). My favorite is the original, plain yogurt flavor. My favorite toppings are raspberries, blackberries, and a crunchy mix called \"Alligator crunch\". The small is plenty big enough, especially with all those toppings. But no matter what you like, Yagoot has it. \n\nIn addition to excellent yogurt, Yagoot has a sweet gift card deal. If you buy a $25 gift card, you get a small carrying bag for lunches (or pints of Yagoot!), AND a super-soft Yagoo t-shirt. So, once you've been and fallen in love, buy gift cards for all your friends. You won't regret it.",

The yogurt has this incredibly fresh tasting yogurt tanginess and bitterness to it which you rarely find in american style yogurts these days.

Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of both of the other places (especially the latter), but I find Yagoot's yogurt offerings so much more refreshing and healthier for you. Add to that  the fresh pieces of mango, kiwi, raspberries or a whole host of other fruits or candy pieces if you prefer that and it takes the yogurt over the top.\nI took my nieces here last week and they absolutely loved it. I have gone with my family, my girlfriend and my friends. I have never once heard anyone said they don't like what they have gotten here. \n\nIt is relatively inexpensive and the young people working behind the counter are always friendly, helpful and prompt. Any long lines move very quickly.\n\nThe only down side to Yagoot is that I can't eat it every day. Long story short, Try it!!! You won't be disappointed.",

      "text": "The froyo craze sure has taken over - I'll be the founder of TCBY is somewhere crying about now.\n\nYagoot is leading the charge in the Cincinnati area. Like most froyo places is somewhat rips off the Pinkberry design document - very new-agey with lots of bright colors and plastics. They do it in a way that looks quite expensive, though, particularly the floor.\n\nUnlike many places (and as I'm more used to), Yagoot is not self-serve. You pick size, flavor and number of toppings, Also, unlike many places you have a choice of 4 flavors. So it's a bit more traditional, if a bit more limiting.\n\nSo how's the yogurt? Fantastic. I somewhat prefer Orange Leaf, if only because I prefer the creamy and sweet, but the quality of yogurt here is much better. It's true yogurt, with that true yogurt tang. My friends absolutely adore it for that tang. I've had each of the current flavors - the plain is quite good, the coconut is amazing, the strawberry is probably the best strawberry froyo I've had, and the peach tastes like peach but isn't very good to my tastebuds.\n\nThe toppings are very high quality, too. Go for the alligator crunch. Yagoot is owned by Buskin (they should consider going with a wider franchisee model, then selling out! If you need anyone that does corporate franchise strategy, find me, haha!), and gets this topping right from the bakery. Other toppings are all high quality and the fruit is very fresh.\n\nThen there are the mixed items on the menu. One is a warm Buskin muffin with yogurt. Don't let the picture lie to you - the muffin is a bit small and you get an enormous amount of yogurt, not just enough to top the muffin. In fact, part of the muffin is buried in yogurt. But man, it's delicious. The Acai berry crunch mix is a bit too trendy, but get it with coconut yogurt, topped with banana and granola, and it's one of my favorite desserts in the area. The slushies made with soda are the only disappointment to me - the red cream soda was kind of gross (it's a bargain brand and just not a good mix.) I'd love to see Yagoot instead use Boylan's Creamy Red Birch - my guess is this would be mind-blowing.\n\nYagoot is a winner. It's hard for an ice cream / froyo place not to be, but Yagoot is pretty much the top of the heap in the area. Beautifully designed stores with majorly fresh ingredients. I'd probably choose Orange Leaf over it 6 out of 10 times, but I do so feeling guilty - this is a higher quality place. They just need a red velvet flavor and Orange Leaf would be out of my head!",

The small is MORE than enough too... they're very generous. The first time we visited was a weekday afternoon, so the staff was really warm and helpful. On the second visit, the woman in front of me was raving up a storm about the fact that the \"Free Samples\" advertised on their signs around Rookwood were, in fact, samples... and not the cup of fruitfully adorned yogurt on the sign. (\"False advertising!\") Moron. I was speechless. \n\nAnyhow, I can't wait to go back and try the coffee yogurt. I had a sample on my last visit and it was as fantastic as I expected. I also noticed that you can buy pints of their yogurt for home consumption. Yum, yum. \n\nI am so thankful we've finally got something other than hard pack ice cream in Cincinnati. It's about time!",

It was delicious! It wasn't tart, and it also wasn't too sweet. It was the perfect mix. They have an abundance of toppings you can choose from, whether you want to go the healthy fruit route or true dessert and add some sprinkles and chocolate chips. Coming from California where there is fro yo everywhere, this is first fro yo I have tried here and it was actually pretty good! I would definitely come back. The actual fro yo shop was a bit small, but typical for a fro yo shop. There were a few tables and a small bar with stools in front of the window. If you want a quick sweet treat when you're shopping in Rookwood, definitely check it out!",

The original flavor (my favorite), has a tangy/tart taste to it because it is pure yogurt. However, this can be an acquired taste, so they do offer tasty seasonal flavors that take the edge off.\n\nMy only complaint about Yagööt would be that it is somewhat pricey. But, to be honest, what ice cream/yogurt place isn't these days? So, if I am going to spend the money, I might as well go somewhere that offers a healthy and refreshing product!\n\nHelpful tip: Get your order \"to go\", as you will avoid an annoying dine in tax. Not sure if this only applies to this Rookwood Commons location, but it will save you some money.",

Mochi is a soft rice cake thingy, and it compliments the flavor of Yagoot while adding a wonderful chewy texture.

The yogurt also seems to be higher in quality -- thick and rich. There are also some unique toppings, like Crunch and strawberry mochi...mmmm. There's less space to lounge around in this location and the atmosphere is kind of lacking, otherwise I'd give it 4 stars.",

      "text": "Yagoot vs Orange leaf = tart vs sweet respectively\n\nThat's the main difference; however, even though you have \"more options\" at orange leaf, Yagoot is far superior. Why do you ask?\nFirst of all, I prefer tart so their options taste better and I like their options for topping better; that's point number 1. \nOkay now for the non biased breakdown. Yagoot is 120 calories give or take and 1g fat per 4oz  vs 140 calories and 3.5g fat give or take for orange leaf.  I think yagoot has a better selection of fresh delicious fruit vs orange leaf I feel like I'm eating ice cream - not necessarily a bad thing if that's what your craving - but if that's the case I'll go to UDF and save myself some time and money. I like kiwi, raspberry, blackberry, banana, strawberry, mango (can you get mango at orange leaf?), okay you get the point. Moving on, I like that yagoot rolls out new flavors seasonally - it makes me appreciate them more. For instance - I can't wait for the pumpkin flavor from yagoot;  the anticipation is making me crazy!! Why do they tease me so? OK seriously it's just yogurt. Anyway, other great things about yagoot - friendly atmosphere - I've never had an unfriendly experience at any location, even at the mall, how are they always smiling and greeting me with such pep? It could be that they are owned by Busken so the same values are applied ;-)   \n\nI'm sure there are other things that keep me addicted, but you get the picture! Enjoy",

Of caution, after trying Yagoot, you may woefully look down on normal yogurt, wishing only that it were frozen with tasty fresh toppings. I love the kiosk where you can place your order and avoid the line and I love that there is outdoor seating (and my dog loves liking my bowl clean).

      "text": "I am a yogurt fan.  I love the stuff, frozen or not, with toppings or not, and in every flavor known to man (with the exception of banana, gag).  So, when I noticed Yagoot's \"now open\" sign at Rookwood the other day, I ran right in...despite having enjoyed Greater's BRC only an hour before.  \n\nStaff didn't greet me at all (and the store was empty, I expect at least a \"hi!\") and I had to move directly in front of the cashier's station to ask for the flavors of yogurt Yagoot offers.  The jaded teenager rolled her eyes when I asked and replied \"Plain and Coffee.\" \"Plain, as in vanilla?\" I asked.  She shrugged.  Fine, then.  I ordered a small plain with chocolate chips on top.  \n\nTo be fair, maybe it was because I was expecting the creamy taste of vanilla...but the overly sour and citrus flavored yogurt that I put in my mouth tasted terrible.  I took another bite; hoping it was just something my taste buds had to adjust to.  Nope, still no good.  I managed to force down the top 1/16th of my cup, but only because it was covered in chocolate.  I threw it away, $3 down the drain.  \n\nI'll go back to Yagoot to try the coffee flavor and maybe even to pick up one of the store's bakery treats (muffins looked yummy) but I will not be indulging in the \"Plain\" variety again.  If you do choose to sample it, I'd definitely recommend getting one of the fresh fruit toppings instead of chocolate or sprinkles...I'm sure kiwi or strawberry would meld better with the citrus in the yogurt.  \n\nOn a side note:  had no idea Yagoot was owned by Busken.  Apparently before the store at Rookwood opened there was a side counter for ordering at the Hyde Park bakery.  I never noticed!",

I still remember when the trend was new and I tried Pinkberry in New York City for the first time a few years ago- going to Yagoot evokes the same excitement for me every time. The frozen yogurt is just high quality. You can tell by the texture- in Cincinnati, Yagoot sets the bar. None of that slightly icey, too-sweet texture of  the self-serve yogurts for this gal.  I don't care if you have 15 flavors when you can't match the quality. I love the tartness and I have loved every flavor I've tried. The current white peach is divine. I also love that the toppings always look fresh and full, and the strawberry mochi! My friend recently tried the smoothie, which was also dangerously tasty. This Rookwood location always looks clean, bright, fun, and funky.

Service wasn't the friendliest but I appreciate that they let me sample a few items.\n\nI got to try the Nutty Professor (hazelnut ice cream w/ sesame, peanut, almond, hazelnut brittle), the sweet potato marshmallow fluff, the strawberry balsamic sorbetto, and the mango and ginger. The sweet potato marshmallow fluff was a bit on the one-note sweet side for me but I loved the Nutty Professor which paired well with the lighter profile of the strawberry balsamic. The Nutty Professor itself was a nice take on normal hazelnut ice cream which usually reminds me of those more chocolate type flavors but the other nuts added different layers of toastiness and nuttiness that really enhanced the flavor. The gelato and sorbetto were creamy but a bit tacky in terms of the texture.\n\nOverall, not my favorite in terms of texture but I love a gelato shop with unique flavors and I would definitely stop by again to see what else they have on rotation.",

I had just the right amount of coffee flavor and a hint of sweetened condensed milk, making for one delicious snack. \nThey also have a variety of coffees and sundaes.

It just about scores five stars because the guy has no problem letting you taste as many as you like with metal spoons which I appreciate so they're not going in the trash.\n\nI had a bunch of different flavours and they were all good. None of them blew me away. The Salted Caramel was definitely the standout. Dutch chocolate is nice but a little basic. The stracciatella doesn't taste anything like the Italian version and in general this gelato is honestly more like ice cream as far as I can tell.\n\nIf you get the red flavours, it's Rojo Gelato.\n\nI could easily knock off a star or two because it's called gelato and tastes a lot more like ice cream and nothing like Italy and nothing like the best gelato which is in New York City and Boston and New Hampshire of all places and of course in Bruges Belgium.\n\nBut instead of judging it based on gelato standards I will judge it based on American ice cream standards and by those standards it's just about a five-star.\n\nAffordable and very friendly with lots of free samples and all the flavors taste good - a couple of them taste excellent. That's all I ask for in an American ice cream joint.\n\nNow someone named Jo is asking me to do her (or is it him), so I'm gonna go Dojo.",

It's at the one end of the market. There's lots of other places around it to stop and shop. \n\nA good thing is they let you sample, so trybas many as you can. It tastes better than the famous Graeter's. That's high praise. It has many gelato flavors. There are also a few sorbettos, all of which are vegan. I had the banana sorbetto. The single scoop is about $5, but it is a pretty big scoop and it's totally worth that. \n\nIt can now be found in other parts of the city. It's original location in the market is still the best.

But as for Dojo specifically, I'm not an expert on gelato but I can at least taste the richness and creaminess compared to other generic ice cream shops. And what I like is how the flavors change from time to time so you're never bored with their selections. Sometimes when shopping at Findlay Market I will stop by and try some of the unique flavors they have before they stop offering it for who knows how long. I've gotten mango, stretchiatelli (google search that), blueberry, goat cheese with raspberry, butter cake, and many other flavors that are just hard to find at other ice cream shops. It's a nice place to stop at for a little treat when shopping at Findlay Market and I will always be looking forward to more surprise flavors from this place.",

The staff person was very helpful and answer my questions about the preparation and educating me on the dessert. I was able to sample a variety of different items prior to ordering. I ended up going with the lemon rosemary sorbet. \n\nThe Frozen treat was really flavorful you can really taste both the Rosemary and lemon flavor. It was very light but tasty. The portion size was pretty good as well for the cost.\n\nIt seemed to be a very popular place as there were several other families in line after me and it was a rainy day. I will definitely return to the location to try some other homemade gelato flavors. It was good customer service as well as a good tasting dessert. The employee did a great job explaining the make up of frozen treat and how it's made there. They have both dairy and non-dairy items.",

Do not.  Wait a little while and then enjoy it slowly.  If you are in public, don't be alarmed if people give you weird stares.  You'll soon realize why when you give yourself a chocolate-stained grin in the mirror.",

I sample the pumpkin and it was pretty nice. I sampled the Dark Chocolate and it was very yummy, but I didn't want to go with such an everyday flavor. When I asked what flavors were the most popular, I was the Salted Caramel, Dark Chocolate and Coffee. So, I gave the coffee a try and it was by far the best!

I received my scoop at once and even ordered the vegan strawberry balsamic sorbetti for my girlfriend. I'm incredibly impressed they thought to add the vegan option to make ordering much easier for the lactose intolerant folk. My girlfriend enjoyed the sorbetti so much, she went in for seconds.  Which usually never happens because stuff like that is usually too tart for her. So two thumbs WAY up!\n\nThe truck has a very welcoming carefree atmosphere about it in addition to its tasty treats. Even as I trudged past the Dojo truck around 11, they were still hopping! They had some suave music playing, changing colorful lights, and a bubble machine. Totally looking forward to another run in, hopefully soon!",

We have tried it with pistacho, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and eggnog. All were good matches for the intense espresso flavor, but I think getting coffee gelato with espresso on top felt a little redundant. The blend of hot espresso over cold gelato is my happy place. \n\nWorth every penny if you've got pennies to spare, my friends.",

      "text": "I stumbled upon this corner vendor while exploring Findlay market. They had a very interesting selection of flavors; Vietnamese coffee, lavender honey, and OLIVE OIL (?!?!), to name a few. There's 12 flavors total.\n\nWell, being Vietnamese, I gravitated towards the Vietnamese coffee flavor. Hot diggity, it reminded me of the cafe du monde brand coffee that old Vietnamese folks drink. It had a rich flavor. The olive oil was interesting. I was thinking to myself, man, what the hell does olive oil taste like? Well, it was good and I would agree it's \"olive oil\" I am eating. It's a light , clean flavor actually. Ok, the lavender honey was fantabulous. It was fragrant, but not perfumed. It actually reminded me of honeysuckles.  \n\nAnywhichway, this place rocks. I like the efficient use of metal spoons instead of plastic, disposable ones. They also sell drinks here. Minus .05 pts for minimum five dollar cc/debit card use, so bring cash if you're planning on a small purchase!",

Like a steam punk espresso machine!  \n\nI tried the fig orange, which I loved, and I hate figs...but the description had \"fat kid\" and \"cake\" in it, so I was sold. The other half of my cups real estate went to fleur de latté, basically sweet cream. It was delicious. My friend had vanilla, which I tried and it was also great! The Flavors were fabulous, the texture was smooth with no crystallization, I just wish the temperature was a little lower. I like my gelato more on the frozen firm side rather than soft serve texture. Each cup, small or large, had the option of 2 flavors. Then you can get a super combo with four flavors for around $6. \n\nWith afagattos and gelato\"wiches\" made with 2 fresh baked cookies just around the corner, I'll definitely be back.",

I had 4 flavors, Pineapple Express, Vietnamese Coffee, Cherry and another one in forgetting at the moment. Moral of the story is: I have had most of the flavors here and they are all above average. Even the sorbets hold up to the cream based gelato so if you are lactose intolerant like my wife there is still a great alternative that won't twist your bowels in knots! I suggest going on a weekday when you can take your time and mosey around the market without having to gobble it down before it melts from the heat of so many bodies pressed upon each other or someone breathes, coughs, sneezes in your general direction ultimately ruining your dreamy-creamy experience. They also sell gelato on fresh baked cookies as a sandwich to eliminate the waste but it was way too hot outside for it not to be a mess while wearing dress clothes!",

Oh Dojo Gelato, why did you never just come get me from my house?\n\nWell after talking to the owner, I imagine that would be quite difficult, considering he dedicates his life to this work. He told me a cool story, a true stick-it-to-the-man saga, a real f&*k-the-marching-ants tale where he broke free of his corporate job to open up this gelato stand. And he is just as thankful for doing it as his patrons are, even though that seems hard to believe.\n\nI had to indulge, so I got the $5 four-flavor cup, and let him choose with one caveat: I get the Cap'n Crunch. This intrigued me so much that it had to be included, but he chose for me the Sam Adams Double Chocolate Bock, the Pistachio, and a Cherry (I think it was Cherry Amarena, not Ameretto). They were all delicious and the Cap'n Crunch was as good as advertised. It tasted exactly like the cereal, but was a completely different experience considering the form in which it was presented. \n\nOh Dojo Gelato, I'm sorry I found you so late, but mark my word: I will return.",

Simply reading the flavors will be enough to intrigue you. I highly, highly recommend the Peanut Butter Sriracha, which is one of the best flavors of anything I've had, as well as the Apricot Cinnamon (which tastes like a cobbler.)\n\nThe true winner, though, is an Affogato, which is an espresso with two scoops. I hate coffee, but love coffee ice cream, and putting two scoops of Salted Caramel gelato in espresso is an absolutely genius idea.\n\nThe staff is quite friendly, even when working long shifts in Washington Park (amazing on a hot day.)\n\nReally, Dojo is just fantastic.",

      "text": "The first time I had gelato was in Austin, Texas. You know, since Texas is a state known for decent gelato. (It was good stuff, though!)\n\nMy second experience with gelato was Dojo Gelato at a Yelp event. I think I was impressed, but the flavors didn't wow me. (Though to be fair, it was around the winter holidays and one of the flavors was eggnog, which I hate.) What won me over on that occasion, other than free delicious gelato was how personable and downright awesome the guys manning the cart were. \n\nNext time I saw the Dojo Cart, I stood in a long line at a Crafty Supermarket event in Clifton and they completely got me hooked. Really, guys? Coconut curry flavor? Be still my cold, dead heart. Or no, wait, bad writing metaphor/cliché. Aflutter went my cold, dead heart with the delightful peppiness of curried coconut yumminess. Not shy about mixing flavors, I got a half coconut curry and half cherry order, and it was so delicious, I had to restrain myself from licking the last drop out of the bowl. And I am pretty sure a more shameful person would have been embarrassed with the way I cleaned the spoon afterwards.\n\nDojo Gelato: if you see the cart, they are worth whatever they're charging and a lengthy wait (if there is one). They are also worth a follow on twitter @dojogelato. Anytime I have mentioned them, they always thank me back in such a way that it's obviously not a thank-bot. Yay for fun customer service and a delicious product!",

However, I am a BIG fan of Dojo Gelato.\n\nMy favorite flavors thus far being the Apple Cider Sorbetto mixed with the Pumpkin . But honestly, I've never put a spadeful into my mouth and said \" no no, this is gross take it away\" . More likely I used my self defense training in keeping those who tried to \"share\" with me far far away.\n\nAlso I'm led to understand they make a mean espresso and coffee so try that too. \n\nMy advice on Dojo is taste it all, taste it often.

      "text": "I've been to Italy a few times, and because of this I might consider myself a snob when it comes to gelato. Dojo is about as good as it gets in the USA. My first experience with Dojo was actually at the Hyde Park Farmer's market this past summer. I was told that if I mixed the pineapple-basil sorbet with the salty caramel gelato, it would taste like a pineapple upside down cake. It was absolutely true. Amazing!! I've also tried the dark chocolate, nutella, and pistachio, and of those pistachio is by far my favorite. It's so hard to find authentic pistachio gelato, but Dojo figured out the secret to creating the perfect flavor without the neon green color that many gelato shops offer. \n\nAs much as I love gelato, though, I don't really crave cold desserts in the middle of winter. But that doesn't keep me away from Dojo. I went to the Findlay Market location this past weekend to try the Italian Hot Chocolate. Also referred to as Cioccolato Caldo and Sipping Chocolate, it really tastes like you're eating a liquid candy bar. AMAZING!!! Sooo rich and thick, but by far, the best dessert drink I've ever tasted. \n\nIncidentally, while I was waiting for my hot chocolate to be prepared, I sampled the Fat Elvis gelato. It's a peanut butter gelato with small bits of bacon mixed in. I was a little skeptical, it was actually pretty good. Not sure I'd want to eat an entire cup of it...but that's only because I much prefer straight sweetness to the sweet and savory mix, and the hot chocolate had me covered there.",

I've had these very same style flavors elsewhere, at an icecream place, and they did not disappoint at Dojo Gelato either. The diavolo is a deep dark, rich chocolate flavor with a very intense and spicy kick at the end from the ancho and cayenne chile's. I like the spicy afterburn a lot.

Oh well, I'll give it to them anyway because they deserve another voice saying how awesome they are :)\n\nEver since I had gelato in Italy I wondered, \"Why the heck is all ice cream not like this!?\" It's amazing and I wouldn't care if I ever ate another kind of ice cream again! So, naturally I was ecstatic to find that Cincinnati has it's own gelato. YUM.\n\nWhen I finally had my first taste I was in love. I love that they have traditional ice cream flavors (Chocolate and Vanilla, but it's no ordinary vanilla) as well as more creative flavors (like Lavendar Honey and Capt 'n Crunch). I had a small serving with a mix of Dutch Chocolate and Salted Caramel. They were both superb! I was torn between those, Nutella and Capt 'n Crunch. I did have a sample of Capt 'n Crunch and I think next time I will try those two flavors... maybe with a shot of espresso on top. Oh yeah, baby.\n\nBesides having amazing gelato, they have a great location at Findlay Market.

(on my last trip one of the offerings was \"Fat Elvis\" with banana, peanut butter, and bacon!). \n\nSo far, my favorite (while certainly not the most adventurous) is a small Dutch chocolate and Hazelnut. It tasted like a chocolate truffle in ice cream form. Yum!\n\nYes, it's a little pricey, but you're paying for quality here, people!  Also, you can get multiple flavors per cup for the same price (2 in the small, 4 in the large). And trust me, it's so rich that a small is plenty for 1 person!",

This, somehow, would be my first time trying Dojo Gelato. I always saw the stand at Findlay Market and the mobile stand at various events, but somehow I managed never to give it a whirl. Today I would not let the opportunity pass and thank goodness I didn't. I was absolutely delighted. It lived up to the extreme praise I've heard from everyone who had tried it.\n\nI got two scoops in a cone: one of pumpkin and one of a sweet cream flavor that I am too uncultured to remember (it wasn't in English). Suffice it to say, both were delicious. The pumpkin was perfectly spiced and actually tasted like pumpkin, not artificial flavors. The other was also great, with the rich flavor of fresh cream. It was a nice mix between the two scoops, with the very flavorful pumpkin sitting atop the subtle sweet cream.\n\nI loved it, but I still had buyer's remorse. She got two scoops: one of salted caramel and one of pistachio. Out of the four flavors, the salted caramel, IMO, was easily tops. They had a million other flavors, though, from the typical (vanilla) to the waaaay out of the ordinary (kit kat). \n\nAll I know is that I will be back and I will struggle to pick a flavor. If you're at Findlay Market or see the cart out on the town, don't miss the opportunity. You will regret it.",

      "text": "Ah, Dojo. Just thinking about them makes me happy and wistful at the same time, like when I remember my days living in Hawaii, or friends that I haven't seen in a while. Happy, because I live within walking distance from Dojo; and wistful, because I don't have any in front of me RIGHT NOW.\n\nPeople--Dojo Gelato is one of the reasons we moved to Cincinnati. OK, we had already decided to move, but it was a confirmation. When we first visited Cincy, we checked out Findlay Market (a wonder in itself), and discovered Dojo. Since it was early May, they had made \"Mint Julep\" in honor of Derby, and the bourbon & mint taste was so realistic, so amazing, that I felt like a lush for eating it before lunch. We also had the \"Peanut Butter Stracciatella\", which was rich and like a really high-class Reese's Cup.\n\nI've said it before--I adore ice cream. You've no idea how much thought I give to ice cream. It's a sickness, I know. So I'm telling you, I KNOW ice cream, and Dojo is fantastic. They use real ingredients (not flavorings--there was real bourbon in that Mint Julep).\n\nThey handcraft the stuff, so its made in small batches and when it's gone for the day, it's gone until they decide to make that flavor again. And I won't lie, it's pricey (I don't eat as much as I'd like because of that fact), but if you have the $$, it's absolutely worth it. Treat yourself at their Findlay Market location or when you see the Dojo Cart around town!",

I sampled a salted carmel and olive oil. I ended up with Mexican vanilla and a spicy chocolate, the name of it escapes me. the Spicy chocolate had a mean bite to it but the vanilla really cooled it down. they let me sample a bunch of different flavors. The olive oil was strange  but i could see how it would be great with other flavors. A regular cup is about 4 bucks and is more than enough serving for something so rich. The staff was friendly.

The girl behind the counter recommended that I try the Nocciolo instead - describing it as an Italian hazelnut flavor.

A guy who looked in charge apologized and pulled the next serving himself (and I get that making espresso is kind of time consuming, but at this point I had waited about 10 cumulative minutes for 2 little cups of espresso in a very packed area and was a bit frustrated/embarrassed). Unfortunately, he did not use a spoon or straw to taste it himself, handed it to me, and (again) it had that bitter/sour/burnt flavor, and was unpalatable. At that point I was not going to complain and wait again in such a busy/packed space, so I walked out and just threw it away. I'm sure there was a less passive-aggressive way to resolve this, but at that point I was done, and their vibe did not seem to overly seek out feedback (eg: \"Hey, so sorry it didn't work, please let us know if it's ok, it's no problem if it's not...\") so the easiest solution was just to walk away.",

I took a free taste of some cherry flavor, and enjoyed it. After some debate though, I opted for a Nutella/Sea Salt and Caramel cup. You get two flavors in the small cup ($3.75) and up to four flavors in the large cup ($4.75), so no matter what, you get to try at least two new flavors. Dojo makes their gelato in small batches and they ensure quality ingredients. The gelato was amazing, and was at the same level as Graeter's.

We were extremely pleasantly surprised.\nThey have a nice menu, but they were out of the fillet tonight and they were also out of oysters. So that's extremely disappointing. Instead we ordered a strip. Their strip is $110, kind of pricey. Is it worth $110?? Absolutely not. Was it good, yes. It was $50 good maybe. It's hard when you have a Jeff Ruby restaurant in Cincinnati because nobody does a steak better.  This makes Jeff Ruby steak pricing seem very reasonably priced, almost inexpensive even. \nThe food was good. \nThe charcuterie board was outstanding. \nWe really enjoyed our waiter, Ben. \nHowever for the money, not sure we would go back.",

      "text": "We recently visited Dear Restaurant & Butchery for date night. At this price point, I would expect top notch service and food which did not happen. First let's start with the good. Cocktails were amazing and very creative, different then what you find elsewhere. Dessert was also really good.\n\nBut... when you charge these prices, everything should go off without a hitch. Service was mediocre at best. Overall it was slow and unresponsive. Specifically, after our waitress took our food order she said she's be back with some bread. That bread never came, and only after we finished our charcuterie and I asked about it did she remember to go get it.\n\nSpeaking of charcuterie, when it was dropped off at our table the runner did not have plates for us. He said he'd be \"right back with share plates.\" It took about five minutes for him to come back with the two plates. Sit back and time out five minutes staring at your food unable to eat it only because you don't have a plate.\n\nBut if the food was amazing I could overlook the service hiccups, but it just wasn't. First the charcuterie. The meat was actually pretty good and unique, A for that. But the cheese was boring and basic. The Humboldt Fog they serve for $8/ounce is the exact same cheese you can get at Kroger for 25% of that price. It's a good cheese, but again at this price point I expect more.\n\nFinally, and what really prompted me to take the time to write this review, was the steak. At $118 for a 12 ounce ribeye, I expect the best steak I've ever tasted in my entire life. The way the waitress explained how they make it and where it comes from it sounded like it would be. Don't get me wrong, it was a good steak. But Ruby's is better and half the price. My wife's filet was $98 for FOUR OUNCES and got the same review. This is all because it's Australian Wagu, but that's the only option. The chicken dish that seemed popular and was brought out at least 10 times after we ordered was already sold out by the time we placed our order.\n\nSo if our check for the night was $100 + tax/tip, I'd give this place 4 and a half stars. Great atmosphere, pretty good service, pretty good food. But when dinner for two costs $300 + tax/tip (for two drinks each, one split charcuterie board, one steak each, and one split dessert) in Cincinnati Ohio, you simply have to bring your A game. They either need to take a hard look at the quality of service and product at their price point, or adjust the price point. Until one of those two changes I won't go back.",

      "text": "Our friends dined here the week before and said don't go. The food and service was awful. We wanted to try anyway. They were correct. The menu looks impressive. It's actually deceiving- from start to finish! \nLet's start with 20+ minute wait for 2 glass wine pours and 2 cocktails. \nCharcuterie should be amazing as they center themselves around the idea. Boars Head meats have more flavor. The cheeses are just ok, and small! The side items were not impressive at all. \nApp course: (ordered all 4) 1st two; tuna, then the hamachi crudo were over sauced/pickled. 3 very delicious and tiny oysters on the next app. The wagyu beef tartare was a large cut on a ground beef, meat grinder. This gave large fatty pellets of flavorless expensive beef- with kalamita olives, mint and parsley, an obscure cream sauce, topped with a very hard cracker. (This is the worst beef tartare I have ever had!) \nLong waits in between each course.\nServer, Emily was nice.\nCocktail menu is creative and may be worth the wait, at times...\nWine somm should find a new career path. He doesn't describe wine with the correct knowledge. Absolutely stunning display of pretending. \nThe side dishes were awful. If you describe pommes with the option to add caviar for $20, you may expect something nice. So we doubled the caviar serving to 12 grams. They serve turbinado sugar crusted, fried potato wedges (the only dish served kind of warm) topped with mediocre caviar! Are you serious?!\nEvery entree is described to have bacon in some way. (Please stop?) The pork chop was overcooked. The rabbit medallions (bacon wrapped) [pictured here] were tasty, yet the beautiful presentation had NO FLAVOR and was under-seasoned. The beef short rib was nice. For an entree that's said to serve 2-4 for $96, it should. \nDessert.... \nEclairs should resemble.... Ummmm, an eclair. They serve two rectangles of burnt chocolate cake with dots of cream in between. The panna cotta was a bit off as well, served with dry over baked Madeline cookies. \nDinner for 4 was just shy of $700. \nWe are really hopeful that they address these issues and succeed. \nIt's been unfairly difficult for restaurants to make it through this past year. This is why we are frequently dining out now- to show them this is why they made it through the tough times. \nHowever, this experience is unacceptable. Please improve.",

      "text": "First review of the year! \nThis resto got me curious with the reviews that I thought must try. Raging reviews of their short ribs and chicken is what I thought we should try. BUT WAIT... They offered a chef's hand special wc is a special 5 course carefully prepared & chosen by the chef at $80/person. As pricey as it seemed we thought it might be worth trying paired with a bottle of cab for $100. See the photos..\nStarted w/ an oyster (ok), small charcuterie (salami, fig, cheese), A shrimp escabeche (a little sour and pickled) followed by lamb sugo (it was tasty and tender) roasted broccolini and short ribs. They were tender and came with puffed pastry, I felt it can use more seasoning and sauce to it. It was good to say the least. \n\nService was good but the wait of every plate was long. Overall experience though was disappointing. Everytime a resto offers a chef's selection special, that to me translates it to be something special and OFF the menu thus you pay a little extra. Only to be served basically everything on the menu shouldn't be called a Chef's Hand rather it was a SAMPLER. We could have ordered all of these ala cart for half the price. They made it up with a bottle of wine.",

      "text": "Total WOW factor! I loved Dear! I totally underestimated them. I heard great things but I just wasn't sure. I decided to try them one night and was so happy I did! Dear is a good date night or night out with the friends kind of spot. I went with my husband and two daughters. I made reservations through Open Table. When we arrived they checked us in and walked us to our seat. The decor and mood was perfect! The decor was bright yet cute. It made the vibe super cool yet, elegant with a chill. The service was also really good. \n\nNow time to talk about this killer food. The kitchen is ran by Executive Chef, Brian Young, and let me tell you, he is doing the damn thing!  He was a contestant on Food Network's Top Chef. That food was amazing! We tried dishes from all courses. We started with the Red Orche Salad and the Shrimp Escabeche. Both were very good and flavorful. The Shrimp came with some crunchy veggies to add a crunch element and a champagne reduction for some tang. The salad had this amazing \"bird seed\" crumble that was delicious. It added the perfect crunch. This dish was fresh and the dressing added a creamy component. \n\nFor dinner we wanted to try quite a few things so we ordered the Short Ribs, Lamb Sugo and Chicken Fried Mushrooms. The ribs are braised for 72 hours. Yyyyaaalll, those ribs are slap your mama good! I mean fork only tender. They were so tender and flavorful. Literally, the second place ever in life I've had the best short ribs. Whew, I could go on and on. My 4-year-old even loved them. The Lamb Sugo is a gnocchi dish with a lamb ragu/pasta sauce. It sounds basic but it's so good! The Chicken Fried Mushrooms are a vegetarian dish. They were so flavorful and had the perfect crisp and crunch. It literally looked like fried chicken. It tastes really good. It came over a bed of risotto. Everything was amazing! \n\nWe couldn't end a meal this good without dessert. We had their Sweet Potato Cake. It was moist and delicious. It was so perfect for the season and cold weather. It was warmed with the spices and hit the spot. We really enjoyed this dish.\n\nOverall, I love Dear! The food is great! It's the perfect date night spot. However, it's also kid friendly. They have high chairs and cups with lids for children feeding. Also, check out their butchery. During the day you can get fresh cut sandwiches made at their walk-up window. It's super cute and cool! Check them out!",

But it did! \n\nI went on a Friday night and thankfully had the ability to sit outside when the weather was still decent. Their patio is lovely! There's a full bar outside As well as a small amount of seats which help practice social distancing. The staff were all amazing. They were so attentive and knew the menu like the back of their hands. \n\nSpeaking of menu, I cannot rave enough about how well done each dish was. The executive chef comes from Tennessee and was featured on bravo tab chef. I'm obsessed with that show! I'm so thankful that he came to Cincinnati and paired his creativity with the owners of the restaurant. This space has transformed into something so beautiful that I'm confident will go far. \n \nI still need to go back during the day and try their butcher, made to order sandwiches, coffee, and ice cream. \n\nIt's an incredible place that I feel everyone will love!",

      "text": "Welcome to the neighborhood, Dear! This review is for the front coffeeshop / to-go / butcher shop portion of the restaurant. I look forward to updating this review once the dine-in section of the restaurant opens in August '20.\n\nAt first glance, Dear is charming from the street with flower boxes, powder blue door, and a subdued sans serif sign quietly announcing \"we are open\". The location is next to Graeter's in Hyde Park Square. \n\nOnce you enter, it becomes clear the intention of Dear is anything thing but subdued. Premium butcher shop, wine offerings, coffee bar, to-go food, wine club, and icecream. Very ambitious.\n\nWe ordered the chorizo biscuit breakfast sandwich which was made with high quality ingredients. The latte and cold brew with house made sweet cream were both very good.\n\nWe chatted it up with the barista and learned they intend to open full scale dining in late Aug '20. He gave us a peak of the restaurant, which has an instagrammy vibe with millennial pink walls, palm-treeish wallpaper, and green velvet booth seating. \n\nCan't wait to return and try the full dining experience. If the quality of the front shop is any indication of the full shabang, this will be a vibey food destination in Cincinnati with aspirations of taking Hyde Park Square up a notch.",

I can honestly say this restaurant failed on every level. \nOne instance is spilling wine on 2 members of our party.....Offered to bring soda water without returning......Avoiding us at every cost. \nThe biggest disappointment is the manager/owner was there and completely aware of every situation as it took place and never came to the table to address the situation which continued to go south.

It was a beautiful, sunny day so I was already in a very good mood. Upon being taken upstairs to our table, I squealed with delight at the gorgeous floral designs on the seats and the colorful paint on the walls that perfectly embodied Springtime! Add to that, our server Emily was very friendly, informative and professional. As for the food, it was a mix for me. The Lamb Gnocchi was TO DIE FOR and the charcuterie board was very good. The broccolini and my second drink were decent, but nothing spectacular. We were not impressed with our desserts though! My pound cake was dry and hard. I absolutely loved the Basic Instinct cocktail - it was tasty and came with a huge bubble on top for you to pop! Very cool. Overall, I approve of this place. They could stand to make a couple of small adjustments though.",

      "text": "Move over Boca.  There are few things in life that I will spend a little extra money for but did is one of those items. 95% of the time this is debating on whether or not to splurge for the guacamole on my burrito. Also, my family has some great culinary skills, and we often find we can make things ourselves better than most restaurants. Thus, the restaurant has to make something really unique or perform at a high level to justify the expense.  One of our current favorites in Cincinnati is Boca, and we will often visit a couple of times a year for special occasions.  It is a rare gem where I know everything will be great. Yet, this incredible culinary experience has been bumped down to number two on our list after our dinner at Dear.  The interior is a wonderful mix of art deco with touches of modern elegance.  The service was attentive, knowledgeable and hospitable.  Every item was carefully explained and we had all of our needs anticipated.  There was also a great flow in the pace of the food. We never felt like we were really waiting for our food but did not rush the experience either.  However, the shining star was the food. We started with the charcuterie board with our personalized selections of meats and cheeses. All were amazing, and we only regretted there was not more because we enjoyed every bite.  The main courses were NY strip, Pork Sugo, and the Short Ribs. All of them were prepared, seasoned and cooked to perfection.  However, the Short Rib was the shining star. It is enough for two hungry people or three normal appetites.  Thus, it is meant to share.  It takes three days to cook and prepare but the end product is worth the investment. It is comfort food at its best on steroids.  The scene from the movie Ratatouille came to mind, and I swear I heard some jazz playing as we savored each amazing bite.  The dinner concluded with a well balanced chocolate tart and Ethiopian coffee.  It was perfection from start to finish. If my bank account would allow me, I would eat here once a week.  However, I must reserve this for my next moment of indulgence. We will be back, but we hope it will be very soon.  That scoop of guacamole on my burrito can only carry me so far for so long.",

      "text": "This place is BEAUTIFUL! I cannot imagine having designed a better space and the peak into the main dining area is very exciting. I stopped in for the to go counter that is currently open. Clearly a lot of thought went into every detail here from the labels to the design of the fridges and the tile and menu. It's all amazing! Such a welcome addition to the neighborhood. My only complaint would be the price for what you get. A grab and go sandwich for $12 plus a small side of a fairly bland green bean salad that was $10. So $22 for a very light lunch. They had a side of mushrooms for $15 that looked to be about one serving. The ingredients clearly were quality but there are places offering high quality grab and go lunch for much much less. I have high hopes for the main restaurant space, will definitely be back and LOVE what they are doing but price wise for a quick lunch this is steep even for someone willing to pay for quality food.",

You basically can pick whatever flavors you want in your ice cream and choose to have it \"buzzed\" with adding alcohol or not. They also have recommendations on the menu for which ones to put with which flavors which is super helpful if it's your first time there. I didn't get a buzz ice cream this time but will for sure be back to try that out! The ice cream was the liquid nitrogen kind that they make right in front of you so I ordered Espresso and peanut butter! The ice cream was insanely soft and it was just really good. Got to try a bite of mint chocolate chip as well and that will probably be what I go with next time- super cool spot!",

If not for the mask he would have litterly would have spit \" We close in 15 mins and it's take out only!\" OK then buddy cool your jets. We both chose the apple pie.... who ever made this recipe has NEVER had apple pie. It was vanilla ice cream over graham crackers. \nMaybe he realized how rude he sounded because he tempered his tone with the couple behind us or maybe it was our Blackness and their whiteness that tempered his tone. I see it so much I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt, because this is more about service and product. \nI'm giving these stars to the quiet man working behind the counter who \"Said have a good night.\"",

I thought it was just going to be a trendy little experiment that fizzled out quickly as people got bored of it because it wasn't REALLY that great.\n\nI was WRONG.\n\nThis place was SO delicious. The alcohol pairs perfectly with the ice cream, and was not too sharp and didn't burn at all like I thought it would as it is uncooked. I got the Honey Bourbon Pecan, but shared the Death By Chocolate and Buzzed Bull with friends. We all agreed that they were all delicious, but the Honey Bourbon Pecan was the best of the three. The regular size was almost too much, and I left feeling very full, but satisfied! My only negative was the ice cream left my tongue feeling a little freezer burnt... I wonder if that's one of the results of using liquid nitrogen. It's not enough to deter me though--  I will definitely be back!",

      "text": "I love ice cream in all forms, scoops, shakes, sandwiches, sundaes. It's all good. That being said I was super excited about trying Buzzed Bull. I mean ice cream made with liquid nitrogen and a little booze, amazing right? \n\nYou walk in and are greeted by a very clean and loud atmosphere. Tables and seating on the left and the line where all the magic happens on the right. To order you walk to the back of the restaurant pick your poison and watch them make it. There's a wide selection of suggested options as well as a create your own choice for the creatives. You can have alcohol or not so it's definitely still a family friendly experience. The staff was really nice about explaining and making their own suggestions about what pairs well together. \n\nUltimately I opted for the apple pie shake with apple pie moonshine. The presentation was a little weak, there was a little whipped cream crushed by hunks if graham cracker, so not super pretty. The shake itself was a little runnier than I prefer but the flavor was there, you could definitely tell that it was apple pie. The alcohol content was pretty low, so don't expect to get \"buzzed\" from this. The shake was good, I really wanted to love it but it wasn't an \"out of this world\" experience. I wouldn't need to make a special trip just to go back. I think Buzzed Bull is more of a once in a while novelty treat, it's not something you crave or just necessarily need in your life.",

They cater to any ages with their Buzzed and non-Buzzed options of ice cream, milkshakes and hot drinks with their yummy cream base!\n\nEverything starts as a base and goes from there. I chose a predesigned concoction; a small Buzzed Creamsicle ice cream. Hubs designed his own, vanilla ice cream with snickers and butterfinger, non-buzzed. Pro tip, download the app for 2 free mix ins. \n\nThe possibilities are endless here. So many options! Plenty of tables and chairs and a few high chairs(!!) so you have plenty of space to enjoy your treat. Alcoholic ice cream can't leave the premises. \n\nSomething for me and others to consider next time; I didn't even come close to finishing half of my buzzed ice cream. Essentially, I paid over $7 and wasted a shot of vodka. I think next time I'll stick with non-buzzed and just enjoy the experience.",

I'm just not sure that the total is greater than the sum of the parts. Ice cream is great. Alcohol is great. Alcoholic ice cream is good. The nitrogen (like Dippin Dots) also starts to give your tongue an odd little aftertaste. This should absolutely be an experience on your \"Things to Do in OTR list,\" but it is more a once in a while than all the time event. \nBonus: they have a flight option for 11 dollars and it gives you 4 different 4 oz samples.",

      "text": "Cool concept -- ice cream that's buzzed with  booze and nitrogen. Tried it with friends after a big meal and walk at Kaze, so arrived quite late at night. It was still open and lots of people around. The line was not very long but it took forever to move. The couple that ordered before us took almost 20 mins to download and app and complete their order--very annoying. \n\nWe shared their butter pecan ice-cream that was buzzed with cognac and with a brownie topping. Honestly, the ice cream itself was average and the combo tasted okay. Our friends got some of the advertised specials rather than trying by themselves and they were also similarly okay. One of them tasted like rum and raisin. Not great, not bad. \n\nI would give it 3 stars based on the ice-cream but 5 stars on the concept. Perhaps, we didn't order the right flavors for us, so it's worth checking out on your own -- I plan to give it another try.",

Maybe next time I have family / friends in town visiting I would take them here, and would definitely be mixing my own flavors - but the sheer expensiveness and lack of flavor / deliciousness who knows if I will ever be back!\n\nRankings on the Morgan scale:\nExperience: 7/10\nDrink Price: N/A\nFood Price: 3/10",

It was pretty quiet when we cam in but traffic picked up very quickly after.\n\nFor some reason, it took a long time to actually order our ice cream. The menu is a little large and there are a lot of options and toppings and mix-ins for people who struggle with decisions. I really liked how you can watch the ice cream being made. That being said it's craziness behind the counter and when a line forms, the place gets even crazier.\n\nEven after ordering, it took about 10 minutes for me to get my order. I believe we had a vanilla ice cream with bourbon and maybe cookie dough? Wasn't very memorable and it was a lot to eat even shared between myself and another person.\n\nI guess I went for the experience because I haven't been back since.",

The liquid nitrogen and all the hocus-pocus feeling is definitely included in the high price mark and I was slightly disappointed that the flight was pre-made. On the other hand, there was no wait time, which is a small pro. \nSecond and most important: the flight was just bad. Each ice cream tasted the same, like a frozen half-and-half cream. It was not sweet enough, blant, I dunno, just so disappointing. Instead of a rewarding treat, I got a meh dessert that will make me think twice before heading there again.\n\nPlease, bring your A-game on! Do not cut the corners :/",

You truly get a unique experience when you walk in -- a plethora of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options, watching the nitrogen vapor spill out as your ice cream is made right in front of you. On top of that, the staff is incredibly friendly and help you a lot in picking out what you want...there are A TON of different combinations. \n\nIn all honesty, I was expecting more out of the ice cream. It wasn't bad, (how could ice cream ever be bad?!) but it wasn't anything too special considering the price. I'm giving a 4/5 stars, because although I love concept and the experience, the ice cream wasn't anything \"a-ha!\" worthy.",

The use of nitrogen to make the liquid ingredients freeze into ice cream is done right in front off your face... behind the glass shield,  like a science experiment.  You can order any concoction your mind can think of into your ice cream. If you want a long island iced tea, do it! Six shots & $30 later you will be a happy customer.  There's three sizes, you choose.  There's buzzed and un-buzzed, alcohol or non alcoholic. Ice cream can be $6 or as high as you make it. You can use regular liquor, mid.or top shelf liquor. You can use mix ins or toppers. The sky is the limit. \nA tip: going on a rainy night could be your best bet to avoid the lines.",

      "text": "Saw an article on this, and HAD to visit this new favorite in my hometown of Cincinnati! The atmosphere is a kid between an ice cream parlor with a new, hip twist! Plenty of seating, and casual enough for a family with children. \n\nYou have a choice between fun flavored ice cream and frozen yogurt, with a variety of toppings.  The real fun comes with choosing your \"buzz\"- Various house, mid-level, and top shelf liquors. Note that there's is a price difference in the tier of alcohol choices. My mix was the honey bourbon ice cream with bourbon, chunks of snickers, topped with fresh (non-alcoholic...womp) whipped cream. It was absolutely delicious.\n\nThese sweet treats are a bit pricey, but with a full shot of liquor in each buzzed bowl, I consider it to be comparable to a drink at the bar.  Great place to check out on a sunny day!",

When alcohol and ice cream are two of your favorite things to consume, what could be better?\n\nCame here on a Friday night and the place was PACKED, which we expected since it's brand new. The place is decently spacious, with a good amount of seating inside. \n\nWe waited in line for about 30 minutes or so, but it was worth it for sure. They make their ice cream from liquid nitrogen, so it's fun to watch the whole process while waiting. I ordered the most popular creation, the Bonfire, which is vanilla ice cream + fireball + chocolate chips + graham cracker crumbs. It worked very well - the fireball was evident but not overpowering. You can also order ice cream non-\"buzzed\" if you're not in the mood for booze!\n\nWill certainly be back! You can always count on OTR when it comes to having hot new businesses with unique concepts like this one!",

It's still fun to get to pick your mix ins. \nThe staff can also help you pick a liquor that will compliment your creation. And I'm sure they will tell you which liquors stand out the most in your ice cream. From my experience bourbon can be a bit overpowering but vanilla vodka blends in more. \n\nI did a non alcoholic vanilla with cookie dough and brownies and peanut butter on top. It was excellent! And the small is generous. I definitely was satisfied. \nI will point out that there aren't going to be chunks of anything because they blend it together but I did taste the flavors of my mix ins. \n\nIt's also sure to impress your out of town guests!",

My friend had the apple pie with cinnamon whisky I think - so good!!! I would NOT recommend the s'mores one though. Looks so good on the menu... but we all agreed that that one just tasted off.

I had to come try it and was worth it.  Because my friend and i had been here it was a little hard to understand how everything worked abd What to order.  The line was pretty long so at the same time we didn't want to hold anyone up.   The lady at the counter suggested to do the \"flight\" which was a sample of 4 different flavors.  So web went ahead and decided to get that.  Which didn't take long to get since they were pre made already.\n\nThe \"flight\"included the 4 flavors of the month in which the lady said that every month the flavors change. Out of the flavors of the month my favorite to sample was the birthday cake,  it had just enough alcohol mixed in with the ice cream.  Very delicious.  My least favorite was the peanut butter only because I don't like peanut butter in a form of ice cream. The other least favorite was the strawberry flavor one which had a lot of alcohol in it.  It was very overpowering and I couldn't really taste the ice cream.    After i mixed it up a little it was better.   I think the alcohol had settled at the bottom.  \n\nOverall the ice cream with alcohol is a great concept.   I will definitely come back.  There is other flavors I would love to try specifically the death by chocolate one!",

      "text": "What is ice cream? Sure, it's ice and cream, but mostly it's process. In a city with a rich history in ice cream making (Graeter's), there's a high standard. Buzzed Bull tries something unique not just in flavor but in process. Unfortunately, they've got neither of these things right. \n\nFirst of all, before even discussing what's going on here on a taste experience standpoint, we've got this liquid nitrogen aspect that totally blows. It flash freezes the cream they use to mix with alcohol. What it doesn't do is develop any of the great aspects of ice cream. They've presumably left out the homogenization of ingredients, as well as the aging time for ice cream to get good. Also there's no creamy sensation to speak of. And worst of all it leaves a horrible tongue feel, similar to burning your tongue on pizza. Then it leaves a unpleasant aftertaste. Even the FDA recommends against any point of sale Liquid Nitrogen use. \n\nOkay. So we've most past the liquid nitrogen, and we don't care about ice cream process, then how is the end product? Lackluster at best. No real flavor to speak of. Total lack of tongue coating pleasure you would want from cream or alcohol. And how could one possibly justify taking a bourbon like Elmer's T Lee and blasting it into frozen oblivion? \n\nIf you're an out of towner, please skip this and walk down the street to one out nations greatest creameries.",

      "text": "Trendy, cool ice cream shop concept. I didn't realize that the ice cream would be made with liquid nitrogen, but it makes sense. It allows the menu to be totally customizable. The draw is that you can get your treat \"buzzed\"--they even have top shelf options! You have almost too many choices! Luckily for people like me, they have suggested creations on the menu. I got a strawberry margarita sorbet. I didn't really taste the tequila at first because the sorbet is so sweet, but it was definitely there. And I was surprised at how big my small serving was! It equated to about a scoop or a scoop and a half. I figured that would be the size of a \"regular\". A small will run you $5-$8, so it was a pleasant surprise to get that much, which includes about a shot of liquor, for that price. \n\nThe shop is family and kid friendly, despite what you might assume based on the concept. All ages are welcome to indulge \"non-buzzed\". When I visited on an overcast, but hot, Saturday afternoon they stayed pretty consistently busy. They are open late, which is really neat. Totally great for a late night treat or alternative to a bar.",

Because every order is made fresh it takes a little bit of time to get yours so plan accordingly. \n\nLots of choices so either check the menu ahead of time or know you make take awhile to order. You can choose a preselected combo or freestyle and go non-buzzed (alcohol free) or buzzed (up to 3 shots in your order!).

Great combo and it definitely had a kick. I do think the alcohol taste is dependent upon what you get because my husband got the Tiger Stripes (rum based) and it didn't really pack a punch.\n\nTip: If you get something containing alcohol, it must be consumed onsite.\n\nI can't wait to go back and play around with the choices!",

If you decide to add alcohol to your mix, you do have to show your ID and cannot consume your ice cream outside the shop. \n\nThey also offer a flight of 4 flavors. Sounds like a great way to try out many flavors, but I decided not to go this route since they prepackage these and just take it out of the freezer.

      "text": "My wife and I visited Buzzed Bull Creamery yesterday after dining at LouVino, which is just down the street.  I am an ice cream junkie, eating enough over the last 30+ years that I shouldn't be alive to pen this review - the longstanding joke in my family is that I do not have a sweet tooth, but rather an \"ice cream tooth\".  With the previous being stated, it is tough to impress me when it comes to ice cream.\n\nThis was our first time at this establishment, but it had been on my radar for several months due to the intriguing alcohol/ice cream combo.  The menu board was a little confusing, but lucky for us the creator of the concept was working and explained things a little further.  Basically, if you are a newbie, just stick to the first menu panel on the left.  Here you can find popular flavor combos the staff/owners have already come up with.  I opt for the Lemon Cake with Gin - the price?  A shockingly high $8 for a small - a price I am gladfully willing to pay providing this blows my socks off into northern Kentucky, unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  Buzzed Bull Creamery has a lot going for it: friendly and helpful staff, unique concept, great location, nice interior space, etc.  What it didn't have going for it with this particular menu offering was \"good ice cream\".  I ordered exactly as listed on the menu with no additions/subtractions expecting a fantastic dish and honestly it was just bad.  Nothing about this worked.  No sweetness, a hint of a strange lemonish chemical flavor, no creaminess, a harsh alcohol flavor - whip cream was good, but this wasn't homemade.  Three stars for all the positives previously listed, but taste is king and this just didn't do it for me, or my better half.  My wife highjacked my ice cream before I could take a bite and quickly stated, \"you aren't going to like that\".  I should mention that you don't HAVE to have alcohol spiked ice cream - you can choose a regular ice cream dish sans alcohol, which may be a more tasty option.  \n\nI will definitely be back to try another menu item and will adjust my review accordingly.",

Be prepared to spend a bit of time inside the store.  Overall the ice cream was okay, it was definitely an experience you should at least try once as part of the OTR experience.",

      "text": "This place is so cool, literally. Love the concept of the science experiment-esq ice cream parlor that has something for the booze enthusiast to the coffee enthusiast, to the non alcoholic kids choices. \n\nFrom the start my favorite has been The Bonfire... which is strange because I HATE Fireball, but to me it just gives this ice cream a smokey flavor as opposed to the cinnamon. All the joy of s'mores and fire in a cup! My second favorite is the hard apple pie, tastes just like it! The buzzed bull flavor is OK. Honestly I've never tried making my own concoction (which is available to do). The consistency and amount of mix-ins you receive are perfect. Sure its a little pricey, but you have to remember there is shots in your ice cream! I have tried the yogurt base, but prefer the ice cream base. Don't forget, you must eat here if your ice cream/coffee has alcohol in it, but don't worry, its a really nice space to hang out in a for a little bit! Its also pet friendly! Summer or winter this is the perfect boozy treat! \n\nPS if you get their app, you can order ahead to have it ready when you arrive, and also take advantage of their rewards points program!",

The staff was friendly and explained how everything works: basically you can choose from the pre-made menu (which we did, selecting their Tiger Stripes), or build your own. Everything can be made in either an ice cream cup or shake form, and you can add various liquors for a buzz. We opted for the shake, and the nitro ice cream was smooth and creamy, the toppings and mix-ins perfectly matched, and the portion size average. \n\nThey also offer abundant seating, though we took ours to go, and just recently released a new app to allow customers to order ahead of time and also to earn loyalty points.

      "text": "So this is a little disappointing to have to write this review after attending the Yelp event that was held here. After the event I was super excited to come home and tell my husband about it. I wanted him to try it and said \"babe we need to go one night on a family outing after dinner.\" Well that night was last night, and after talking it up it was an embarrassment for my husband to try. I'm the foodie of the two and do well with picking restaurants. After this he looked at me and said \"babe you fell short with this one, and how are they open?\" \"This is it good at all\". I just dropped my head with this face :/ and said \"well it was good when I came to the Yelp event.\" There was no wait so that was perfect. \n\nIt starts with either an ice cream base or a frozen yogurt base followed by add-ins and most importantly for some the booze. They use Kitchen-Aid mixers and liquid nitrogen to whip up the creamy dessert. Their bases produce nice and creamy treats, it was cool just to watch. \nHowever, these creamy treats have no flavor. In my opinion this is the true test. You can have something bland and cover it up with alcohol but when it's stripped down how does it really taste? They failed here! \n\nSince we were with our 10 month old daughter who we shared the ice cream with we did not get alcohol added. I also prefer the non-buzzed version. I have tasted their ice cream with the alcohol and I honestly didn't care for it. I'm a traditional gal and the alcohol infused flavors tasted just like alcohol with mix-ins. In my opinion it takes away from the \"traditional\" flavor of ice cream because all you taste is alcohol. It's an interesting concept but just not for me. \n\nWe ordered a small plain Vanilla with Oreos mixed in. Thank goodness we only ordered a small. I would have been pissed to order a bigger size and it wasn't good. We picked the ice cream base instead of yogurt. I raved about this base because during the Yelp event they let us taste it before being frozen and it was awesome. Well when it's frozen with just vanilla it's not so hot! They do everything from scratch and add the \"flavors\" as they go, even Vanilla. Ok, I'm fine with this and all for it if it's good! This \"ice cream\", flavorless cream, or whatever you will tasted awful! It was bland, not sweet enough and the vanilla tasted cheap. It's like the flavor of the base and vanilla never mixed well and tasted separate. What I tasted was the bland base finished with a cheap tasting vanilla. Totally off! I come from a southern family who makes their own ice cream so I know what homemade ice cream (with the vanilla being added before freezing) should taste like. This is definitely not it. The Oreos didn't even mix well. It was like cream and then Oreos. It was so weird. I have never tasted an ice cream where the Oreos didn't even mix well. \n\nOverall, I wanted this place to do well but I think the hocus-pocus of it being made with liquid nitrogen looks cooler then the product taste. The main thing going for them is the product has a good creaminess. It lacks tremendously in flavor and sweetness. They want to grow it and start franchising but if they don't make some changes they will be in trouble. There are too many other good ice cream places around for them to be lacking. They will definitely fall short to the competition. If nothing else you definitely need a strong base as everyone will not get alcohol in their base. Honestly now I realize the alcohol infused ice cream flavors, are only hot because of the alcohol. The mix-ins don't quite \"mix-in\" either. It's basically cream with mix-ins but it doesn't taste cohesively blended. It's like chocolate chips folded into cream and each individual part has its own separate flavor, but the flavors don't play nice together. Like oil and water! When I chew my ice cream it should all taste cohesive not like cold bland creaminess with a chocolate chip just kind of out there. Needless to say, we won't be back.",

      "text": "Hmmm...I may be in the minority here, but I just didn't think the ice cream tasted very good. This place feels more gimmicky to me than something that I would actually go to regularly. That being said, it was fun, so I still think you should check it out at least once. \n\nOn the recommendation of the guy working there I got the buzzed bull ($8 for small; coffee, bourbon, caramel, nuts, whipped cream).  I should add that they weren't exactly forthcoming with recommendations, which would help because the menu is super confusing...I had to ask 2-3 people for what is their most popular item. The value seems really good to me since I would pay $9-12 for a cocktail in OTR, and this had toppings and stuff mixed in it. I like that they make it with the liquid nitrogen right in front of you...It's a pretty fun show! I also like that the liquor can be customized, from well drinks to top shelf liquor. I just went with Jim Beam because that's the base liquor.\n\nMy ice cream was ok. Frankly I didn't taste coffee or caramel, just peanuts and Jim Beam. I thought it was way too alcoholic tasting, and I basically just didn't like it. My friend ordered strawberry daquiri base with gin and blueberries and she really liked hers, so maybe my flavor was a bad choice or the person making mine didn't balance it very well. \n\nThere was no wait when we went in, but when we left there was a short line. You have to enjoy your alcoholic ice cream inside. Overall, I don't know if I'll be back, but I enjoyed it for the experience.",

Go east to New York to experience the real deal.\n\nB: If you're coming here to enjoy \"ice cream\" spare yourself and just go to Graeters. It's truly booze-infused here and if you're going for ice cream you will definitely be disappointed. \n\nC: Now, if you like booze-infused, try the Buzzed Bull, nice flavor and my husband enjoyed it. I blended rum with coconut ice cream and added sliced almonds. It was smooth with a nice hint of almond and I enjoyed it.\n\nSo with that being said, I enjoy wine infused ice cream more than booze. However, Buzzed Bull is perfectly fine for something different. Keep an open mind and try it.",

As an Engineer, liquid nitrogen Ice Cream isn't anything absurd or crazy, it's in the standard playbook for any kids science day event. \n\nThe creamery here makes it more \"adult\" by adding in liquor into base if you want it buzzed or you can get it non buzzed. You also have the option of ordering from a preset menu or you can build your own like a blizzard. \n\nOverall, the ice cream was just decent. The flavors were not there for me. I think the showmanship is great because you see your ice cream made in front of you. But if you want good ice cream, go to Graters and pour a shot of liquor on top of that.",

The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because of how long the wait is even when it's not busy. I guess it's just a long process, but twice when I've been in I've seen them have to remake someone's so I think it's just maybe growing pains. Also, it's definitely pretty pricey, but I do understand alcohol increases the cost.\n\nThe ice cream I got was cake batter, peanut butter, vanilla vodka and sprinkles - one of the flavors they have listed on their premade flights (which also sounded great, and convenient that they are premade!). I really liked mine, and didn't think the vodka was too overpowering. Most people I was with liked theirs, except my friend who got brownies in his said it didn't taste like brownies, but more like cubes of sugar.\n\nI went back and got cake batter, brownies, sprinkles and no alcohol, and I thought it was still pretty good.

It's on the pricier side, but it's basically dessert + a drink, so the prices make more sense when you take that into account. And the servings are HUGE - go smaller than you think. I really like the monthly flight option, but the downside is that then you don't get to watch the liquid nitrogen (which is half the fun!). The Bonfire flavor is to die for. I've never strayed into the create your own flavor because Bonfire is so good. The only real negative of this place is that the employees always seem somewhat annoyed. I'm sure that they get sick of everyone taking videos of the liquid nitrogen - but that's sort of to be expected at a liquid nitrogen alcoholic ice cream shop. \nTLDR: One of my defaults to take out of town visitors, great taste, fun idea and vibe, but don't expect amazing customer service.",

      "text": "First off, the concept of this place is awesome. Who doesn't want ice cream with liquor mixed in? And the presentation of how the ice cream is made, complete with plumes of liquid nitrogen vapor, makes for a pretty cool experience. The location itself is very nice and the staff very friendly as well.\n\nThe ice cream itself, though, is a total mixed bag. My first time here I ordered the Bonfire (a s'mores-like specialty). While I didn't think it tasted like a s'more exactly, I did find it delicious. The Fireball pairs well with the sugary base, with the cinnamon hit *almost* like the taste of a campfire. The marshmallow syrup itself though is completely lost in the mix, and I would probably substitute it for\nvanilla next time.\n\nThe Tiger Stripes is another story. I normally think of stripes as referring to two different flavors but this one just tasted like I was eating a bowl of chilled peanut butter out of the jar, and the drizzle of pure peanut butter on top only emphasized that. I love peanut butter sundaes but I would never get this one again. It needs to be balanced with other flavored to justify $7.59.\n\nWe also tried a straight non-buzzed strawberry ice cream for my kid. This was by far the most disappointing one. It was a faint pink and had the ever so slightest taste of strawberry.  But mostly it just tasted like cold sweetened whipping cream. When I mentioned it to the staff they were not surprised. Apparently it was made by blending in three strawberries and nothing else. The did happily remake it though by making a cake batter ice cream with strawberry syrup and strawberries mixed in. It was great after the remake but the original was so bad that I'm baffled why they would knowingly serve it!\n\nSo will I come back? Probably, but I'll be careful on what I order. Hopefully the menu gets revamped soon so the consistency of flavor can be improved.",

Not even exaggerating it took OVER 20 MINUTES to get my ice cream as the worker took her time acting in no hurry whatsoever. There was only one worker making ice cream on a hot Sunday afternoon, this is unacceptable and they should warn customers about the wait before ordering because I would have walked out. Not to add that the worker struggled to explain their concept to me and acted like I wasn't understanding how they made the ice cream....The ice cream was okay, barely tasting the booze. I won't be back with many other great ice cream options in town that take no more than 5 minutes to serve you.",

My friends and I was so curious about nitro alcohol infused ice cream so had to check this out. \nThere was about a 15 minute wait because two people in front of me took that long to decide on something. It can get a bit confusing to figure out how to order, essentially pick an ice cream flavor, one free mix in and if you want it with or without alcohol. I got the strawberry daiquiri ice cream with pineapple mixed in. Watching the process was exciting, with all the steam and such puffing around! The ice cream was creamy and flavorful, a nice summer treat. Someone actually took my order at the end of the line, so they had to make me a new one. \nI'd suggest ordering one of the specialities, such as Death by Chocolate or Tiger Stripes (my friends really like those). It can be expensive, but remember you are paying for booze. Also you have to eat the ice cream inside if it contains alcohol.",

      "text": "Have you ever had ALCOHOLIC ice cream?\n\nNo?\n\nWell you should - and the perfect (possibly ONLY) place to start is The Buzzed Bull Creamery. \n\nStopped by on a dessert date one Saturday evening to check out this cool new place that just opened. We were in the mood for something sweet, different, and dare I say...erm....DARING. Buzzed Bull definitely lived up to those expectations.\n\nI noticed two things when I walked in: (1) How clean the place looked and (2) how it looked like one part bar and two parts ice cream parlor. Liquor bottles are shelved behind the counter where you order and see your sweet treats come to fruition. There is a decent amount of seating in the place and it looks both inviting and distinctly adult at the same time. I will offer one qualm: The spot where people order their liquor-infused ice cream creations is not all that clear. It's near the back of the place with only a tiny \"order here\" sign indicating where to go. It was partially for this reason we were a little confused when walking in; however, we needed some time to look at the menu anyway so no biggie.\n\nWe weren't too sure what to order. Yes, I've enjoyed my fair share of alcoholic drinks. Yes, I have delighted myself with the finest of iced creams. But mixing the two....what's one to do?\n\nMy date ordered a Kalúah and coffee infused chocolate ice cream and I ordered a rum infused strawberry ice cream - both suggestions by the staff. The chocolate was rich and out of this world! The rum/strawberry, while nice, left me wanting a bit more sweetness; however, you can definitely taste the alcohol and ice cream working together. It's something I'll definitely be back for!\n\nAs a bonus, you get to watch the creation of your ice cream. The power of mixing kitchenware and liquid nitrogen finally unite in front of your very eyes! It's an eerie experience, watching metal bowls act almost as cauldrons to make your flavor come to life. \n\nI wanted to have some fun writing this review because I think Buzzed Bull is a really neat place.  \nPut simply, the staff is friendly and the alcoholic ice cream is a wickedly delicious evening treat. I hope to return soon!",

The ice cream was homemade and I do think their base product seemed good but my experience was ruined by waiting legitimately over 30 minutes for a small ice cream and milkshake. Come on. If I had known that, I would have never made a purchase. (Probably why they don't let it be known because they'd lose so much business). Who has that much time to just sit (and sit) and wait for ice cream? Not me. No one was in a hurry, it was obvious many customers were getting frustrated over their outrageous and unknown wait times, but the workers didn't seem to care or even address it. Separately, the nitrogen seems cool and all but it was too much for the flavor it added and was used too much (about 15-20 nitrogen blasts per order). And I couldn't taste a hint of alcohol that you pay double the price for. \nBasically I won't be going here again.",

Sadly, this place is not made for people with allergies whatsoever. My friend who has a nut allergy asked what she was able to order and the man as the register said he wouldn't get a single thing because the dishes were not washed that well. I totally understand him telling her not to get anything but after he said the dishes were not washed that well I am a bit cautions (what does that mean?!). Hopefully this spot can accommodate but allergies in the future since it is so common, but also maybe wash their dishes better? \n\nMy buzz cream was delicious on the other hand. There were a large group of us and we ordered about every type on the preset menu. I'm interested to come back to try to customize it a bit. \n\nTip: don't go here while day drinking or before a night out. Your stomach will hate you.",

It was delicious (although I wish I added chocolate chips) and you could hardly taste the alcohol. It was about $7 which isn't bad considering you get a whole shot of liquor plus ice cream. Double shots were about $12. \nI highly suggest dazzling up your ice cream because the flavoring can be kind of bland (I tried my boyfriend's strawberry ice cream as well) but the ice cream itself is very creamy and delicious. It's all made in house so I give them props for that. Add some crunch or flavor if you are creating your own and make sure you know what will mix well! If you're not the best at customizing, I suggest ordering from the specialty menu.",

I found this place through this app and my girlfriend of course loved the idea of \"buzzed\" ice cream. Parking is on the street or in one of the nearby lots. It's a cute little small shop and when you walk in it's very Urban/Industrial feel, which I really loved a lot. The menu is quite extensive, lots of goodies to choose from and different ways for them to be made. You can also get coffee as well. The ice cream as stated in other reviews is made with liquid nitrogen. The production line has clear see through glass, so you can see your ice cream being made. It's actually super cool because you see the nitrogen rolling out of the blender. It honestly looked like a science experiment. I got the White Russian and my girlfriend got the Dreamsicle. Both were amazing and we shared ours to get the best of both worlds. I can already foresee many trips here during the summer. Prices aren't bad in my opinion, especially if you're getting booze in your ice cream. I love helping small businesses out too, so I have no problem paying a little bit more for quality. Keep up the awesome vibes! :)",

This is highway robbery masked as \"gourmet\" ice cream. My gut says the idea is there, but the execution is not. Upon arrival, you pick a flavor, mix-in, and decide if you want it with booze or not. Seems pretty straightforward, or so I thought. \n\nMy partner and I went this evening, and for two adults (we both ordered the honey bourbon flavor--I ordered a small, him a large) it was $30. \n\nFOR. ICE. CREAM. \n\nWhen the cashier said it would be a $9.50 up charge for my ice cream if I got \"top shelf\" whiskey (on top of the base price of $6+ cup) I felt paralyzed. Never in my life have I felt so robbed before eating ice cream. Normally this choice of dessert evokes pleasant feelings such as happiness, joy, sometimes bliss. Today, I just felt angry, confused, and in pain. \n\nIf the asinine prices weren't enough to drive you out, maybe the debilitating injuries will. There should be a \"Danger! Wait 15 minutes to eat your ice cream.\" sign by the pick-up window.\n\nBuzzed Bull, you should have your employees warn customers about how cold liquid nitrogen is and how cryogenic fluid *probably* shouldn't be consumed. Just a thought. One bite and it felt like my mouth was on fire. My partner threw his large cup of ice cream away after suffering through half. That's how unbearable eating this ice cream was.\n\nBut hey, if you like your tongue and the roof of your mouth feeling fleshy and raw while eating overpriced, bland ice cream doused with liquor, then this is the place for you.\n\nAs for me? I'll pass and never return.",

It looks very modern and scientific and you can tell that the staff knows what they're doing. My beef is with the product itself. \n\nIf you didn't know, Buzzed Bull Creamery makes their ice cream to order - they combine your preferred flavor combination, topping choice, and your favorite spirit together into a custom-made ice cream of its own in 10 minutes or less. The process is impressive and it is quite the experience watching the employees craft their work together. \n\nThus it's not the employees that ultimately soured my opinion; the ice cream itself leaves a lot to be desired. It's airy and the texture is somewhat chalky. The taste is almost what you would expect from an alcoholic ice cream however it's lacking what the branding suggests it would have - creaminess. \n\nI know a lot of it's flaws ride in the process - you can only do so much with made-to-order alcoholic ice cream. But I believe if Buzzed Bull was to strip away some of the showiness and focus on having a truly great product to offer, I could see them becoming a future staple of the city.",

Twice now I have waited in line for 10+ minutes with not a single person ahead of me even having the chance to place an order. Throngs of people behind me sat waiting for their orders, and four mixers churned away for what felt like forever, trying to deliver ice cream to the dozens of people waiting.\n\nIf you own a business that is clearly on to something, invest in the labor and the additional equipment to meet that demand. We left. Not worth waiting. l can stir some tequila into ice cream on my own.\n\nUpdate: I returned and was able to finally try the product. It still took about 15 minutes to order and get our ice cream, and it was ok but nothing spectacular. Just not worth the wait and the hype, I suppose.",

      "text": "This place was such a disappointment. I think the hype really set me up for the disappointment I experienced. First off- the ice cream tasted more like butter than it did ice cream. I took my toddler (who loves ice cream) and he turned his face up and only ate the mix-ins (gummy worms). Before you ask, I got the non-buzzed for the kiddo. For myself, I got a flight which sounded cool when I read the menu but was pretty disappointing. They all tasted exactly the same. I had a rum based, tequila, bourbon and one that wasn't really memorable. They all tasted like butter with a hint of alcohol infused. One listed ingredients as mint, alcohol and chocolate chips and it turned out to be chocolate sprinkles! Not the same in my book. All in all the $20 bucks I spent here could have been better spent somewhere else because I wanted ice cream and this was not ice cream. The service was good and there was a cool visual seeing them use nitrogen to freeze the alcohol but aside from that I can't recommend this place.\nAfter eating 12 ounces of ice cream, I walked out as sober as when I walked in proving that milk really does help you reverse the effects of alcohol. They have a great gimmick to sell ice cream but I'm not sure it's enough for me.\n\nNot so humbly submitted,\nMichael C.",

      "text": "Actually stopped by Buzzed Bull for the first time out of ice cream necessity! It is the only ice cream place open past 10pm on the weekdays that we could find in OTR.\n\nI am a bigger fan of frozen yogurt than ice cream so I was glad to see they had frozen yogurt as a option. I figured (like most IC places) they would have a few yogurt flavors and a ton of ice cream flavors but this was not the case at all! They make each flavor when you order it from an ice cream or a yogurt base so all their flavors are available in both IC or yogurt :D The frozen yogurt was super creamy and the mint flavor was really strong and natural and exceptionally delicious.\n\nIt's a somewhat gourmet ice cream experience considering you choose your base, flavor, mix-ins, and alcohol if you want it buzzed or not. I wasn't in the mood for a buzz so I went with a regular mint chocolate chip small for about $5. We also got a large Dreamsicle which tasted amazing. But somehow that order rang in at about $20 which is pretty steep for an ice cream outing even considering the triple sec in the Dreamsicle.\n\nFun experience, definitely will return.",

The concept is so cool (alcohol-infused ice cream frozen right before your eyes with liquid nitrogen), but the ordering process is a little confusing. Everyone in front of me and behind me in line had questions when it was their turn to order, so there was an extended wait time. I chose a White Russian with Reese's as a mix-in. Loved the flavor and consistency of the ice cream--on par with places like Cold Stone, plus there's alcohol! I'll definitely be back to Buzzed Bull, and hopefully their ordering process will be streamlined by the next time I'm in.",

Lots of flavors and mix-ins, so lots of options.\n\nWe weren't asked if we wanted ice cream or yogurt; I assume we had ice cream, but perhaps they should ask if a customer doesn't specify (yes, I could have asked myself).\n\nI was surprised how long the making took. It wasn't a problem, I just didn't realize that it's iterative: mix, add some nitrogen, mix, add more nitrogen, etc. The employee running mixers seemed to keep a close eye on several at once, to achieve the desired texture.\n\nAnd the texture was very good, very smooth, creamy and thick. A few bites were more solidly frozen than most; some might dislike this slight unevenness, but I thought it emphasized the made-to-order nature of the item.\n\nWe didn't get whipped cream, which costs extra. But I was surprised to see another customer's order topped with... canned whipped topping. I figure if you're charging for it, it should be real.\n\nPerhaps the ice cream is a bit too sweet -- I prefer less-sweet desserts.

That is not to say Buzzed Bull is only for adults, \"nonbuzzed\" flavors are available too. Bring the kids in for something different from the norm.  My children loved watching the ice cream being made. While their ice cream wasn't buzzed, their minds were buzzing with questions about liquid nitrogen. Not sure how long it the offer is running, but they are running a \"happy hour\" special. All buzzed orders were buy one get one half off. Alcohol flavor has been strong in all of the buzzed concoctions I have tried. I have tried four different buzzed flavors.  Personally, I find mixins with a higher fat contents to have a noticeable feel of oil on the tounge. The feeling is similar to how a frozen Reese's Peanut Butter Cup feels. With there already being so many reviews, I'm not sure what else to add.",

It also took awhile for the ice cream to be made - to be fair, I understand its a process that involves them temping down the cream right then and there but if that place had been slammed the wait would have been RIDICULOUS. I do know folks who've gone and waited 40 minutes for their ice cream there - that for me is a bit much. The ice cream itself was creamy and tasty and they have a good base product. My friend got a sampler/\"flight\" of a couple different boozy ones and though they were creative, I personally didn't care for them vs the regular \"virgin\" options. \n\n The atmosphere is great there and they did a great job on it, but going into an ice cream shop and not being able to try a sample of any flavors b/c they're made fresh isn't ideal for me. I'd suggest the owners maybe consider having a small cooler where you can try stuff - otherwise, how will you know what kind of flavor combo to get?",

The line was super long when my friends and I arrived, but that just gave us more time to look at the menu. I really liked how they had suggestions for flavor combinations. The process of how they created the boozy ice cream treat was so cool and reminded me of an episode of Bill Nye. They mix everything together and then blast the concoction with LIQUID NITROGEN. That is so insane! I think everyone should try this place at least once. Science rules!",

      "text": "Good Ice cream with a big price tag!\n\nThe Environment \nWe stopped in here after the Labor Day fireworks downtown. We took the street car up to OTR and stopped at Buzzed Bull. We found very quickly that we were in a bad part of town as this was just barely in OTR. The restaurant inside was very cute and had plenty of seating. \n\nThe Food\nThe ice cream was very good and I liked that you could customize your own if you wanted. I ordered a medium Death By Chocolate with 1 shot. You couldn't taste the vodka (upside) and the ice cream was very creamy. The only problem I had was that I ordered too much (go with the small). \n\nThe Value \nThe medium was over $10. I understand that it has a shot of vodka but even then it should not be over $10. \n\nI doubt that I will be back to spend another Alexander Hamilton on ice cream.",

Maybe I'm spoiled by all of the great ice cream places in Cincinnati, but the creams here are very underwhelming. Weak flavors, no noticeable change in flavor when you add \"buzz juice\" (liquor) - which is probably due to the tiny splash they put in - and a very boring trendy presentation. This place is for people who either don't know much about ice cream, don't like ice cream, don't care about ice cream, don't like/care about/want to enjoy shakes or anything I guess. I would 1 star it but the service was quick. Definitely a hype spot, clearly sucking up to local wanna be foodies! Sorry! Real foodies only here! My wife hates this place and I do too.\n\nBull cream more like Bull $#!%",

An alcoholic ice cream treat sounds as amazing as it truly is...You walk in and see a huge menu to the right overhead...you choose your size, flavors, alcohol or non-alcohol in your treat and any added extras such as candy or fruit which comes with one free per size! You can choose from many different brands of liquors to put in your treat as well..well brands and top shelf. You can put as many flavors as you want in your treat as well. I chose the coffee, honey Bourbon flavors with banana. I got a shot and a half of their house Bourbon, a shot of coffee and the bananas mixed in. It then went into a Kitchenaid pro mixer with a stainless steel bowl and a faucet of ice covered liquid nitrogen over the bowl. The concoction is then mixed on high for about 5 minutes and shots of nitrogen are pulsed into the mixture to freeze it. You can also watch while all of this is happening..which is a plus! Your number is then called and you get to enjoy this amazingly flavorful treat. I definitely was buzzed leaving the creamery and happy as a clam too knowing I have such a cool and deliciously fun place in my city! Can't wait to go back!",

The guy at the front with the red hair was condescending and appeared to be irritated by my questions. He literally rolled his eyes after being asked to change my ice cream from unbuzzed to buzzed after realizing Kahlua was available. This was my first time being here and I am skeptical to return after the service alone. I understand that the place was busy but customer service should always be first.

Perfect for a nightcap. \n*Friendly staff - the staff were friendly and willing to help give suggestions. \n*Great Ice Cream & cool experience \n\nCONS: \n*The line is a little tricky to navigate. When you first walk in, there is a mesh of people waiting in line to order and people that have already ordered, so it's a bit confusing. I would suggest they tell customers to have a seat and designate a staff member to either call out order numbers or deliver to tables that have designated numbers on them. This would make for a better customer experience. \n*Price - I found that for a small chocolate by death with 1 shot of vodka it was a little over $8. That's just a little too pricey for me and seems a little off. \n*Seating - there wasn't enough room to find a place to sit. Yet again, this stems back to the issue of customers standing right where seating should be when they are waiting in line to order. \n\nConclusion:\nGo try it at least once. It's a pretty cool experience but I'm not sure that the price makes it worth it.",

The rum inside it had a delicious aftertaste, and the peanut butter chunks were the right amount (plentiful). We highly recommend visiting this place if you're in Cincinnati and want some delicious dessert--with alcohol or not!",

      "text": "The fam and I have been excited about Buzzed Bull Creamery since we read about it in the newspaper--apparently everyone and their mother read the same article because the place was packed.  The concept is super innovative, trendy and perfect for being in the heart of OTR on Main Street--liquid nitro ice cream creations prepared fresh to order.  You have the option to infuse any toppings or liquors you want into your ice cream, hence the \"buzzed\" part of the business name.\n\nWe went as a fun mothers day outing and the line was to the door.  The line didn't move incredibly quickly, but it also didn't move slow enough to deter us from waiting--it probably took us 15 minutes to get up to the register.  The staff was very friendly and made us feel like it would be worth the wait--especially since you can see them working their magic with the liquid nitro behind the counter.  \n\nWhen it was finally time to order, the cashier was friendly and knowledgeable and explained to us how the ordering worked.  One confusing question she clarified for my mom I'll share on here because a lot of people might want to know.  My mom inquired if the \"frozen yogurt base\" option was lower in calories than the traditional.  The cashier clarified that the frozen yogurt base wasn't a lighter option, but a true, full fat yogurt option.  They essentially take their traditional, sweet cream base, and infuse it with yogurt to give it that yogurty tang.\n\nMoving on... here's how you order:  Pick your base, pick your toppings, pick your alcohol (if you are 21 and up!).  OR do what I did if hand selecting all the options overwhelms you and pick a pre-created menu option.  \n\nI got one that had fireball, vanilla, graham cracker, and chocolate chips for a s'mores like experience.  I thought the ice cream was very creamy and not overly sweet which is a plus for me, but something to note if you are used to a sugar bomb in your mouth.  I thought there were enough toppings to provide enough topping to ice cream ratio.  Here are my two minor complaints:  1) The alcohol and 2) the price.  The alcohol added a really great flavor but after 3-4 bites, it felt like I was taking a shot of fireball and I could feel that slight burn from the liquor in the back of my throat.  For me, the \"buzzed\" novelty wore off after those few bites and I had wished I just ordered it without the alcohol.  The price was another sticky point for me as for the three of us, the bill was 27 dollars.  That is a lot for the quantity of food you get.  However, if you look at the price including the experience of watching them hand prepare each order, it can be justified a little.  However, when I think summer and new ice cream place, I want it to be something affordable that I can return to all season long and this didn't meet that mark.  Definitely a fun special occasion or perhaps date night type of place. \n\nOverall, I was impressed with the space, the staff and the trendy concept.  While the price bothered me a bit, I still would return here if there was something I wanted to celebrate with friends or family.",

You can either build your own or go with their tried and tested flavor combos (which I'd highly recommend). I had the Tiger Stripes, a peanut butter and chocolate combo, and it was unreal. If it's your first time going, I'd recommend the small as it's a generous portion and pretty rich.  Lastly, I have to mention how awesome the team there is. I live nearby and was able to casually meet Shane & Colten a few weeks back as Buzzed Bull was still being put together... seeing them in action now and how great an experience they make this for customers put a huge smile on my face. The kind personalities there make this a business that you want to support, not to mention the awesome ice cream. Welcome to OTR, Buzzed Bull and I know you'll be a staple here!",

I tried the ice cream flight and it seems like a good buy because you get to try four ice creams at once but I would pass on getting that one the first time. You are really doing a disservice to yourself if you don't get one of the speciality made ones.

The non-alcoholic was simple but tasty but both the alcohol ones had a very overwhelming taste of alcohol. I like the taste of alcohol in my drinks but this was so strong I couldn't get any of the other flavors. I like scotch and bourbon straight up so I am not afraid of strong alcohol but if I am getting it in something I want it to be balanced.  Maybe you need to upgrade to the higher quality liquor but the standard just did not taste good.

Definitely service with a smile! \nThere was an awesome selection of ice cream including sundaes, frozen drinks, milkshakes, malts, and more. Truth be told I didn't get a picture of the menu because I had one thing and one thing only on my mind, ice cream. \nI had the cookie monster sunday. Holy cow was it amazing. Cookie dough chip and cookies and cream ice cream. That was topped with hot fudge, whipped cream, and chocolate sprinkles. What Sunday isn't complete without the cherry on top. The ice cream was absolutely delicious and cold. Again I was too focused on my ice cream to get a picture but trust me it looked as amazing as it tasted. I highly recommend if you are looking to cure that sweet tooth with some delicious ice cream.",

      "text": "Awesome location... Right in the middle of downtown Cincinatti, near the ice skating rink, this Graeters turned out to be the best choice for a late night sweet bite. While Graeters ice cream is always great, specifically the maple cinnamon crunch flavor (My favorite), the service by the 3 woman inside was superb. I went on a Wednesday night 12/30/20 and each of the woman inside went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that my wife and I had everything we needed. While we went to this shop close to the end of what I am sure was a busy day, these woman acted as if we were their first customers of the day. While I wish I remembered their names, I put the date on this review so to ensure that the managers at this location know just how lucky they are to have an incredible staff. \n\nTheir is seating available inside but it is limited, thankfully, very few people were staying to eat their ice cream inside so my wife and I were able to sit down and enjoy our ice cream. The shop was clean, and the ice cream was frozen.\n\nAs a last comment on the ice cream, I am consistently blown away by their Sorbet, I tried the raspberry sorbet tonight and it was superb! All in all this was a most definitely good experience, and I hope customers to come are able to be greeted by the best in customer service at Graeters Downtown Cincinatti.",

      "text": "--Pre-Covid Review--\nCame by on a rainy day in the winter so the shop was pretty empty. There's a few tables around the large ice cream shop if you wanted to stay inside or you can take a walk in the park area right outdoors. Since it was a slow day the workers were all talking among themselves and it was a bit difficult to get their attention.\n\nI had to try the famous Buckeye Ice Cream (Peanut Butter Cookie Dough w/ Dark Chocolate Chips). As far as texture goes, Graeters definitely has that classic ice cream shop creamy, velvety, and dense texture down. I found the texture a bit on the soft side though. As for the ice cream itself, it was tasty but just a bit too sweet and heavy for me. I love similar flavors but I just need the amount of sweetener turned down a notch. The chocolate chunks were nice and the whole thing tastes sort of like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup crossed with a brownie. Really really indulgent flavor. I could only finish about half the small scoop.\n\nOverall, Graeters is a solid ice cream shop that's more on the traditional sweet side. It's a fun place but not my preference when it comes to ice cream.",

It has a high butterfat content and isn't light or airy.\n\n4) They are famous for their \"Signature Chip Flavors\" with 14 chip flavors\n\n5) The chips are poured as a liquid and then frozen into the ice cream, The process creates a variety of soft uniquely shaped chips.  \n\n6) They have 50 locations across Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Indiana.\n\n7) Besides ice cream, they sell candy, desserts and all sorts of baked goodies.\n\n8) My dish of Toffee Chocolate Chip was one of the best ice creams I've had in a very long time. \n\n9) Graeter's was an awesome place to visit, full of history, tradition, a great atmosphere, a lot  of flavors, and outrageously good ice cream.",

      "text": "When it comes to peanut butter chocolate chip there is no better ice cream flavor.\n\nBeing from the Cleveland area and living in Columbus everyone from the Cincinnati area always mentions that Graeters is the ice cream to try. I was traveling for work and decided to check out the hype. \n\nI walked in and instantly locked my eyes in on the peanut butter chocolate chip. I wasn't in the mood for much ice cream so I went with only (1) scoop. When I got to the register I was surprised to see that it was almost $5. For the quantity I don't think it was worth the price. The ice cream was good but I wouldn't put it above the Cleveland favorite (Mitchell's) or the Columbus favorite (Jeni's).\n\nI would still recommend going to Graeters over any other ice cream shop if you're in the Cincinnati area.",

      "text": "Hello non Cincinnatians traveling here for business, this review is mostly targeted for you! This location is something locals know is great, and as a visitor this is your perfect opportunity to try very high quality ice cream at a reasonable price! On nice evenings, enjoy your choice outside on Fountain Square. If its winter? Youre still going to want to try this!\n\nThis location on Fountain Square must make a killing and for sure gain some loyal new customers that have traveled into town for business. It is ALWAYS busy, but the staff take that in stride. There is plenty of people to help, let you sample the flavors, and get your final choice out to you quickly. The bakery case and seating area looked a bit like a tornado had gone through on this particular Tuesday evening, but in all fairness it was an hour before closing. \n\nI would say the Graeters token flavor is Black Raspberry chocolate chip, which has high quality dark chocolate chips in it. Having whatever flavor on a waffle cone is a must! They have many limited time flavors which are also always good. Most recently I tried the Honeycomb... honey ice cream with a generous amount of crispy honeycomb in it. I didnt expect it to be as amazing as it was! MUST. GET. MORE.  If you want some yummy baked goods they have those too, but come early in the day to get the best selection.",

      "text": "Ahh Graeters, easily the best part of the Cincinnati region.\n\nThis Graeters in particular is my favorite solely for the location and service. In terms of location, it is located in the heart of downtown Cincinnati, adjacent to Fountain Square. My friends and I always find us grabbing a dish of ice cream here and heading out to watch one of the weekend concerts. As for service, I have never waited in line more than 3 minutes here. Even when the line wraps around the store, they pump customers in and out quickly. There are also a few tables inside along with a water station which makes it the perfect place to rest. \n\nI've also found that this particular Graeters gives much larger portions than other locations. One scoop here is almost double the amount anywhere else.\n\nIf you're ever in the Fountain Square area, stop on into this Graeters. You won't be disappointed!",

Business folks on lunch break. Tourists like myself. Teenagers on summer break. But the line moved super quick. \n\nI went with the Black raspberry. Wowzers. This ice cream is super dense. Super creamy and super delicious. \n\nChunks of chocolate come mixed in. My tour guide CincyCindy told me how they make the ice cream - putting a layer of chocolate on top then cracking it into various sized chunks. That means one chunk might be more like a speck and the other one a monstrous Nugget. Amazing. \n\nIt's not a strong raspberry flavor, but the color of it is bonkers. Looked great for this food Pics haha. \n\nIt's a bit messy to eat on a cone. One scoop is huge.  Walked around downtown as I devoured the cone. It's right in the park so sitting down by the fountain with a cone and maybe your sweet darling isn't a bad way to spend an afternoon stroll.",

And it doesn't stop there!!! They even offer a range of fantastic baked goods, toys, candies and other kinds of souvenirs in over 50 retail stores.\n* \nEven @Oprah agrees when she said that Graeters was, \"absolutely the best ice cream I've ever tasted,\" in June 2002.\n*\nEver since 1870, #Graeters have used their famous French Pot Process. This involved developing a hand-made, metal bowl that sat inside a wooden bowl filled with ice & salt. This pot would then be filled with a mixture of cream, sugar and eggs and then attached to a motor and spun, forcing the mixture to the sides of the bowl where it would freeze, being scraped off by paddle until it came together. This requires the ice cream to be made in smaller batches of 2.5 gallons a time ensuring quality, care and passion in every single scoop of ice cream that is served and hand-packed. This care for what they do, and they HUGE chocolate chips is what sets them apart from the rest of the chasing pack.\n*\nWhether it's the Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip or their very first flavors of Vanilla or Chocolate, or a variety of their many, many other flavors, Graeters is THE number one stop for all of your ice cream wants and needs.",

      "text": "\"Mine's bigger.\"  \n\nThis phrase sums up my childhood memories of Graeter's. (Yes, it's also a line from National Lampoon's Animal House.). Who was patient enough to excavate--by spoon, tongue, or fingers (whatevs...we were kids)--the BOULDERS of chocolate that were encased in ice cream? We dug, we compared, we gloated. MINE IS BIGGER.  Then we ate those enormous slabs of chocolate like the greedy, ungrateful children that we were. \n\nI'm an adult now, and while I can still eat Graeter's ice cream like Jim Belishi in line at the cafeteria, I've picked up a few nuggets  of experience and knowledge about lots of things, including the following about Graeter's;\n\n1. Those BOULDERS are quality, dark chocolate, a girl's best friend;\n2. When you carry a dozen cherry cheese crowns onto an airplane as a gift to your Florida aunt, other passengers will offer to buy them from you;\n3. Graeter's ice cream is made by a French process that roughy translates into English as, \"cold bliss mouth\";\n4. If you send only one box of Opera Cremes as a gift, your aunt may hide them from your uncle, thereby causing marital strife (send TWO boxes, clearly marked for each recipient);\n5. Glazed Happiness [doughnuts] are not false advertising;\n6. Arrive early (before 9 a.m.) if you would like Glazed Happiness on Fridays;\n7. Seasonal flavors, e.g., Strawberry Chip and Watermelon Sorbet, will possibly send you into the stratosphere (Moral: Keep an open mind!).\n\nI write now because the Graeter's store nearest to my workplace is being renovated--a veritable first-world, dearth of happiness! This absence, unlike others that have inspired exploration of other possibilities, has def made my heart grow fonder.",

We were waited on by a very enthusiastic student aged employee who gave us a sample taste of several ice cream flavors before we ordered using a coupon I had from an Ensemble Theatre Cincinnati ticket for a buy one get one free cone. We both had an extra scoop of ice cream in a cup with the cone on top. As usual the ice cream was very creamy and delicious especially after it started to melt. We sat down by the fountain to enjoy our treat and take a few pictures.

We'd never seen those cones before but I was too intune with my waffle cone to remember to ask for a bite. It was gone in about the same amount of time as mine. For my non sweet loving husband, maybe it's that Graeters ice cream speaks to your soul, or it was just hot and the welcome chill from the ice cream was needed, he sure put it away quickly!\n\nI was super excited that it was about $1 cheaper to buy the same thing at this store as the ones I usually go to in Lexington, Ky. Worth it!!!\n\nThe staff were very nice and I think I inhaled the ice cream in less than two minutes- it was hot, had to eat it before it melted, right? Sorry no picture of the gloriousness that is black raspberry chocolate chip!!",

      "text": "Overrated is the word that came to my mind as I finished my ice-cream here. No, it wasn't pathetic at all. But there wasn't a much wow factor either. However, given a choice, I would go for Cold Stone which is few miles away in Newport. It may have a less diverse menu from Graeters but very good quality ice-cream. \n\nIce Cream:\nIn terms of menu, there are some good innovative items on the list and you can definitely try that.  We went for Apple Cinnamon Sundae and Affogato. Affogato was actually nice with more of a rum flavor than espresso in an ice cream. Or perhaps it was Bourbon Pecan that was doing the talking. I liked the concept and the end product was good. However, Apple Cinnamon Sundae was more towards \"okay\" than amazing. None of the above are on their regular menu, so I may have tried a little too much. However, having had a taste of their ice creams from Kroger store, I am more certain about Cold Stone than Graeters. The lady serving us wasn't even aware that Apple Cinnamon Sundae is on their menu. She read through the ingredients on the board behind her and made it.\n\nAmbiance:\nThe place was very crowded and remains crowded pretty much all the time because of the legacy. There is much more besides just ice-cream if you want to purchase. They made a good use of napkin holder by placing information about their history and their process of ice cream making over it. The place is a little cramped with a decent seating capacity. But if it is a warm day, you may as well take your ice cream out and enjoy it sitting at Fountain Square itself. \n\nStaff:\nThe staff was good, overall. While the lady was clueless about Apple Cinnamon Sundae, the lady at the cash counter quickly jumped in and helped us out to explain to the server what do we want. That was very good. There was a huge crowd but the turnaround time was pretty quick, so not much of a wait there. \n\nOverall, it's a good place and worth try. But not so amazing as people here make it sound.",

The first time we came yesterday we got the black raspberry chip and mint chocolate cookie in a chocolate waffle cone, and tonight we got the brownie sundae. Serving sizes are average, not necessarily generous, and flavors are your average ice cream shop's offerings. \n\nI was surprised by the large chocolate chunks in the ice cream; these aren't little flakes of chocolate but rather dime-sized hunks.

I ultimately got the Pistachio ice cream (3.75 for a single scoop), which was super creamy, with exciting chunks of pistachio in every bite. I got some chocolate for the trip home.

I compared it to Trader Joe's Salted Caramel Swirl gelato and there is hardly any difference in the taste and texture. And you get double the quantity with Trader Joe's for a dollar cheaper. I do like to buy Graeter's brands from Whole Foods when they are on sale though as they are very good and worth the cheaper price.",

Such a large variety of flavors to choose from and at such a good price! My double was $4.50. I had the pumpkin and blueberry pie... pure happiness! The pumpkin was so thick and flavorful, and I loved the real pie crust pieces in the blueberry pie. If the blueberry pie wasn't partially melted when it was scooped for me, my experience would have been absolutely perfect! I'd love to try the mini pies and other sweet options Graeters has if I'm ever back in town.",

But I also love this location because there are benches outside and tables across the street that are perfect for the summer. \n\nTwo important reasons why Graeter's is one of the best in the country:\n\n1. Their chocolate chips can be as big as your palm! Also, have you noticed how a lot of chocolate chips taste waxy and hard? Not these! They have a nice chew to them and a super rich flavor.\n\n2. All of their flavors are awesome. Usually, I find a favorite flavor at each ice cream shop and I stick to that one and never try anything else because I know that it won't satisfy me the way my favorite does. But at Graeter's, I get a new combo every time! Basically any flavor with their ginormous chocolate chips are a win, but I also like to consider the seasonal flavor as well!",

Dare I say it, but I've had a better milkshake. \n\nThe ice cream itself is very rich, a testament to their small batch, French pot process. The key distinction from other ice cream places is the quantity and quality of added ingredients. I went for the toffee chocolate chip ice cream- the toffee was rich and generous in portion. Similarly the milk chocolate chips weren't the usual hard over-frozen crunch bits but soft, melt in your mouth type. That won me over. But the milkshake was a slightly overpriced, too thin mix. It seemed like they skimped on the ice cream and added far too much milk, making it rather disappointing. \n\nFor a random ice cream place, I would go back, mainly for the ice cream than milkshake, but I didn't feel it stacked up to it's inflated reputation.",

I find this particular location right in the middle of Fountain Square, downtown Cincinnati. Located on the first floor, this iconic establishment gave proof that it was one of the favored locations in the city.  The line was 10 deep, which somehow provided the impression that it was shorter than normal.  I stepped up and ordered the small cookies and cream in a cup.  While only paying about three dollars, the attendant generously filled my cup.  I paid for my order and stepped outside to taste this Oprah Winfrey-endorsed product.  I noticed in the first bite the elevated cream content. The Oreo cookies were plentiful in my cup and I savored each and every bite.  It was silky and satisfying. While I can't quantify whether this ice cream is the best I've ever had, I must say that it is in the top five. Make sure you visit while visiting Cincinnati.",

      "text": "A while back, a friend told me I had to try Graeter's ice cream when I visited Ohio. She talked up the chocolate chips, mentioning that they were huge and stayed soft in the ice cream. My curiosity about Graeter's chocolate chips persisted for years afterward. How could chocolate chips stay soft and delicious in ice cream? I didn't believe it.\n\nA scoop of Graeter's signature raspberry chocolate chip was the first thing I ate on vacation. I am normally unexcited about most fruit-flavored ice creams and avoid M&M's and chocolate chips in ice cream, as they usually result in little added flavor and sensitive gums. I bit the bullet and figured that raspberry chocolate chip is the best-selling flavor at this revered chain for a reason.\n\nWell, SHOOT. Graeter's black raspberry chip ice cream stood out as one of the best things I ate on a vacation laden with delicious eats. The chocolate chips are the best I have ever tasted-and they do remain soft and perfect in the ice cream. The black raspberry flavor was so vivid and lovely without being too sweet. You could taste the freshness and quality of the ice cream in each bite.\n\nGraeter's shattered some of my long-standing preferences about ice cream in one bite. You know a food is excellent when it changes how you relate to it afterward. Sadly, no other chain has those chocolate chips. Graeter's is wonderful. I can't wait to try other flavors-always topped with a scoop of raspberry chocolate chip.",

      "text": "My first experience with Graeter's ice cream was a couple of years ago, when my Ohio-born-and-bred SO noticed that Kroger started selling pints of it in Atlanta. Yum! I kept hearing that the stores had even more flavors. I've driven through Cincinnati plenty of times, but have never stopped to check out a store. \n\nWELL.\n\nFinally, this past weekend, I was actually going TO Cincinnati instead of driving through it (I feel like I'm too excited about that but whatever). On Saturday, I hit up the Graeter's nearest to my hotel. It was maybe a block away. Score! On Sunday, I came back for more.\n\nNO SHAME. \n\nHere are the flavors I tried:\n\nBlack Cherry Chocolate Chip \nCookies and Cream\nBuckeye Blitz (or maybe it was Blast?)\nCaramel gelato\n\nThey were all amazing, beautiful, and everything that is right with the world. \n\nHere's the thing about Graeter's. The \"chip\" part of their ____ Chocolate Chip flavors is not your tiny little shaved bit of chocolate you normally find. They are chunks, sometimes shockingly big, of chocolate that somehow manage to stay soft and creamy, and they melt in your mouth in an oh-so-lovely way. I've actually occasionally wondered whether the chunks are too big. Bold statement, I know. Go ahead and kick me out of Chocoholics Anonymous. But I will say that never has the size of their chocolate chips kept me away from their ice cream. No freaking way. \n\nI think all future road trips to my SO's home state are going to require at least one Graeter's stop. He's the one who got me into this stuff in the first place. Now he's going to have to deal with my addiction. \n\nP.S. Service is friendly. They also offer a small assortment of pastries and chocolate bars.",

Luckily this place is right by my hotel!\n\nI opted for the highly recommended black raspberry with chocolate chip. First of all it's not chocolate chip. It's more like delicious huge chunks and somehow is still at its chocolaty prime. I normally don't like chocolate chip ice creams because the cold makes the chip brittle with that waxy mouth-feel. This one is somehow still amazing! I wonder what's the trick? The ice cream itself is creamy and rich and dense- definition of good ice cream in my book! And it goes very well with the chocolate chip without been overly sweet.\n\nThey also sell ice cream flavored car freshner! I got the raspberry one so now everytime I get in my car I have a great flashback of an great ice cream experience. Despite the cold, it is worth it!",

A solid ice cream place with fresh ingredients and flavor. \n\nThey are generous with their portions and allow customers to sample unlimited flavors... we definitely did not take advantage of this because there were people behind us in line, but I wish we did! All the flavors looked ridiculously good that it was hard to choose just one. \n\nMy friend told us that their chocolate chip flavors sometimes will have giant chunks of chocolate in them. He got the black raspberry chocolate chip flavor and of course in it was a GINORMOUS chocolate chunk. I was so jealous! \n\nI ended up getting the cookie dough and loved it... LOTS of cookie dough.

I would recommend the coffee flavour, although nobody in the store could tell me if it contains caffeine or if it is artificially flavoured. \nI like that they offer sorbets and 'gelato' type, which is less sweet and appeals to my European self much more :)\nWould definitely NOT recommend the pastries and chocolates there. I purchased the chocolate bars with Cincinnati skyline on the package, and it tasted really cheap. The buckeyes were absolutely tasteless, like ball-shaped butter chunks.  \nAnother disappointment: Polish donuts sold for Fat Thursday as 'PACZKI'. The dough was much too yellow and egg-like and the cheap pie-filling type of marmolade was a huge no-go for me, a Polish Gal.\n\nGood hint: register for a free Sweet Rewards card and get a free ice-cream dessert for your Bday!",

I am also continually horrified by the nutrition information, but that's my own deal, perhaps?

I do wish, with all that sweetness around, that they wouldn't use a hot chocolate machine, I mean...really? It's overly sweet in a bad way, but it'll do if you're looking to warm up 'caffeine-lite'. \n\nThe Fountain Square location really is convenient and pretty charming this time of year (Holidays), also a nice refuge from the cold winds that occasionally whip through the area. \n\nI think the store, with the variety of cookies, treats, and ice cream, caters to most everyones palates, it just doesn't always hit the spot for mine.",

God created Graeter's so they could do magical things with peanut butter like make peanut butter chocolate covered pretzel ice cream. \n\nNow, I am a frozen yogurt, italian ice kind of girl but when I heard from my fellow convention goers that Graeter's was THE place to go in Fountain Square, I headed right over. The shop is clean, the staff is friendly and fun, and the ice cream? 2D4--aka 2 Die 4. Super yum to the point where I wish they had it here. Of course the 110lbs I lost via WW would be a challenge to keep off if Graeter's was here, but boy is it nice to have authentically hand-made ice cream again. \n\nThanks Graeter's!",

It has a small mom-pop feel to it with homey looking baked goods and candies. Unfortunately the line makes this place crowded. I liked the sundae I had just fine... but altogether it fell short of my expectations. Mostly because of the hype.. If you aren't looking to be blown away, and are in the neighborhood --it's decent ice cream. Friend had the salted caramel and felt it was too sweet. Coming in as an outsider to Cincinnati, I say this ice cream is good but nothing special. Locals may differ in their opinion of this but if you come expecting average you will be more likely to be impressed.",

What the heck are those guys doing on those turtles?\n\nAside from my distraction with the fountain, I found the chocolate chip bits to be a little less than ideal. I'm pretty sure it's the choco-snob in me that's disliking the slightly plastic-like feel of chewing on those chips. They tasted ok, not very sweet or very chocolately (dark chocolate perhaps?) and was a good texture combo for the ice cream itself. Perhaps if I come on another day the manager will be nicer?

Considering how often, I am surprised I wasn't a fatter child...where did that metabolism go???\nThey use a process called \"French pot\" that makes it really creamy.  I almost always get mint chocolate chip in one form or another and the chips are amazing!  It aren't chips, they are SLABS! Once when I was young, I had a cone and a tiny chip peeking from the top ran all the way to the bottom of the giant scoop.  That chip must've been 4 inches long!! \nIf you like ice cream or pastries, go here...often.\nThere are many locations, the newer ones are very fancy with ice cream scooper shaped door handles and ice cream pint light fixtures!!",

Finally in town for the Flying Pig Marathon, I got to try it out.\nI ordered 1 scoop caramel and 1 scoop Buckeye Blitz.\nI thought it was really good, but it doesn't take the place of my favorite (Oberweis Dairy in Chicago). The fiance got the peanut butter chip and THAT was really good. They also have a pretzel cone which I didn't order, but tasted and it was really really good with the carmel ice cream.\nMy recommendation: Get a scoop of peanut butter chip in a cup and get the pretzel cone that you can dip into it.",

Needless to say, he was thrilled to take our family there. We arrived around 9:15 and it was pretty crowded, but the ice cream was on point. However, the end of our visit was very unpleasant. It was 10:15 and we asked an employee to take a picture of our family, as being there was an exciting moment for us. She refused to take the picture, and as she was walking away, she murmured \"I can't take a picture, I have too many things to do, and by the way we closed 15 minutes ago\". Our family was shocked by this as she proceeded to warn us that usually she gets security to escort people out, meanwhile we hadn't been asked to leave once. Her manager sat there and watched. He said nothing. Our much anticipated experience was ruined, as we left feeling completely uncared for and unwelcome.",

It is made of cane sugar, fresh farm cream w/o hormones, hand-picked berries, actual Oreo and Heath bar pieces, etc etc. It's worth it as an occasional treat (especially to buy it pre-packed).\n\nPersonally, the chocolate is what makes this ice cream so good. Whenever I eat other ice creams with chocolate pieces in it, I'm always so sad and dream of Graeter's as I'm eating this other ice cream.\n\nMy favorite flavors are: MOCHA CHIP, COCONUT CHIP, and TOFFEE CHIP. They don't do \"1/2 scoops\" to get 2 flavors in one, so the 3 mini sampler tray is a good way to get a variety (and you can just pretend that it's for your \"friends waiting for you in the car\" before you gobble it all up yourself).\n\nI always talk about CA, i know, but seriously... all my friends back home rave about it as well!\n\nAnd although UDF, Breyer's, Ben and Jerry's are all good in their own right, and much cheaper...

No other ice cream has the same type of chocolate chips- they are always either too thin or too hard and not melty at all. The ice cream is good, and of course the history makes it all the better. Definitely a staple Cincinnati food.\n\nMy favorite location is definitely Clifton, but the Fountain Square location is well-placed and much closer to where I live. Maybe it's been a while since I've been to another Graeter's, so I could be crazy, but can't you usually see the array of flavors in their tubs? They don't have that at the downtown Graeter's! I know that the flavor names are self-descriptive, but for some reason I like to see it before I eat it. Anyway, this is not a real complaint. Now, go eat something with chocolate chips!",

I'm the kind of cold-confection fan that I will eat ice cream in the dead of winter, with gloves on, in the snow... and I will enjoy every second of it!\n\nHaving only lived in Cincinnati for a short time, I am surprised to say that I can put to rest every other great ice cream experience -- Graeter's surpasses them all.\n\nI love the chips. They are not chips in the way that other ice cream shops define chocolate chips. When they make their ice cream, they pour melted chocolate on top of the churned deliciousness and churn it again, breaking the partially-hardened chocolate into pieces. Some pieces are small, some are big, and some are so huge that you need to bite it once or twice to eat it!\n\nMy personal favorite is the Toffee Chip, though you can't go wrong here regardless of what you choose.\n\nThis specific location is right in Fountain Square, which is fantastic for tourists or for anyone who has just eaten at one of the many downtown restaurants and need dessert. It's not a bad location, the staff is nice, but there are many other Graeter's shops that I enjoy more; to name one: Ludlow Ave in Clifton.\n\nWherever Graeter's is served, I'll enjoy it!",

Well when he realized this we had to get going to catch our flight so we of course get to the airport and our flight is delayed....I walked over to the information desk and asked if they had a Graeter's in the airport, she said No but did tell us where the closest one was....\n\nSooo we took a cab about 10-15 mins away had him wait for us ran in I got the Mint Chocolate Chip and my Boss got the Raspberry Chocolate Chip. His was better than mine but thats ok. It really comes down to the Chips that they use in the ice cream that is what makes it soooo good other than that though the ice cream itself is just ok.\n\nNow after all said and done our Ice Cream Adventure cost us (my boss) about $60 was it worth it?? I dont think so! We did however make the lady sitting at the Information Desk happy when we brought a pint back for her!!",

The flavor is awesome and the chocolate is soft enough to melt in your mouth, even frozen in the ice cream. It's a little pricey, but worth it for the quality. \n\nMinus-one star is because the say that they can pack quarts to travel and stay cold for up to 24 hours in dry ice, and that didn't really work the best. I was headed to my boyfriend's house, which was about 7 hours away, and I brought him ice cream that I had them pack up at the store, which definitely melted at least a little bit because when we ate it after sticking it in his freezer for a couple days it was kind of icey. Still really good (coconut this time) flavor though. I think the guy didn't want to charge me for more dry ice than I really needed, which I appreciate, but I would rather he have erred on the safe side and spent a couple more dollars. Not a huge deal, and I still definitely would recommend Graeter's, just make sure to ask them to pack it extra-carefully if you want to travel with it.",

      "text": "We read that Graeter's was the place to go for ice cream in Cincinnati.  We were in the Fountain Square area and decided to give it a try.  My daughter order a black raspberry phosphate as she was not in the mood for ice cream.  My husband had a cookies & cream ice cream cone and I ordered a chocolate malt.  The malt was good & creamy, however, you could barely tell it was a malt vs. a shake.  My husband enjoyed his ice cream cone.  \n\nThe place was busy as it was Memorial Day weekend so we were unsure who was making the phosphate.  When my daughter received her phosphate she asked the girl if it was a phosphate and she said yes.  The manager was in the middle of ringing our sale and walked away.  I waited several minutes and finally asked someone if they could ring us out.  Really?  I could have walked away and saved $11 as the cashier looked a little put out that I asked her to do this.  When we got to the table it was discovered that the phosphate did have ice cream in it. When my husband took it back the girl who had made it asked someone how to make one.  When he came back about 5 minutes later it still wasn't right.  There was carbonation & fruit but little to no syrup.  \n\nIf I ever go back to Cincinnati, I would give them another chance but for now I would recommend that they train their employees properly before a busy weekend that had the Taste of Cincinnati at their doorstep.  Train these kids and the manager in good customer service, it speaks volumes.",

      "text": "I recently visited Graeter's while visiting with my boyfriends family.  I had read about Graeter's on yelp and I was surprised by all the rave reviews.  So I went there with restrained hope.  I tried black raspberry chip as suggested by so many yelp reviewers and at first I was kind of... wondering what it is that I was expecting.  It's just ice cream after all.  But something magical happened.  As I kept eating my super scoop of ice cream somehow it just got better and better until it was fucking amazing.  And when I was finished I needed more.  The texture of this ice cream is incredible.  It's rich and light and fluffy and creamy and just about every other positive description you can come up with.  It's magical and surely they must include blood of the first born unicorn or something in it because the deliciousness of Graeter's is inexplicable.  I'd have to say that if you are going to try Graeter's you have to try a flavor with chocolate chips in it.   They are amazing.  They are rich and dark but not so much so and huge.  They aren't really chips but large chunks of delicious soft chocolate.  We sat there trying to figure out how it is that chocolate sitting in a freezer could not be frozen solid but rather delicious and chewy.  \"But if it's in a freezer, why is it not frozen?\"  Graeter's defies reason, logic and nature.  \n\nI can vouch for the raspberry chip, mocha chip, and coconut chip, mixed, or as we called it, mochacoconutchip.  For two ice cream dishes it was roughly 6-7 dollars, which I felt was entirely worth it.  Every time I go to cold stone it ends up running me 15 dollars, and Graeter's is approximately 800 percent better than any other ice cream I've ever had, so they could charge me 800 percent more than any other ice cream and  it would be a reasonable asking price.",

Holy mother of gawwwd! WOW! If you love that tart rich ripe flavor this is superb! Nada uses it to make margaritas, and I totally stole the idea.

They carry anything from pies, meats, jellies, herbs and it's all from local businesses also. And the staff is super friendly. Mr. Madison and Michael know our family well now, after shopping there over the last few years. The first thing they do is ask how our 4 girls are doing. Then they usually tell them to grab a juice or milk as a prize for being good helpers. You can't get that at a giant store! Madison's is definitely a hidden gem that will continue to receive my support for years to come. I highly recommend a visit. I love this shop!",

If you live in the neighborhood, this is your best (and possibly only?) source of organic produce and pastured animal products. \n\nPROS:\n-Organic produce (and non-organic)\n-Pantry items (some organic as well)\n-Pastured meats (limited, some frozen)\n-Wonderful service (often the owner himself serves us)\n-Wmall family owned and run\n\nCONS:\nI'm going to list things that some people would think of as cons, not all of them are truly negative.\n-Tight quarters. I don't dislike this. They're making good use of the space and really carry more than you'd realize so it's worth asking if they have what you're looking for- chances are they do or can tell you who does at Findlay.\n-Not a mega store (again, this isn't a bad thing, but I want expectations to be clear). You won't find each and every thing that you'll ever need here. But again, there is more than you think, so be sure and ask if you can't find something or just don't have a lot of time to search.\n\nLast of all, I would highly recommend shopping here during the week when the rest of Findlay is moving along at a steady hum and not crowded like the weekends. If you want to get the perks of the weekend without the crowd, come on FRIDAY when everything is fully stocked for the weekend. Parking lot is free for the first hour M-F and that's always worked perfect for me!",

      "text": "I routinely shop at Madison's to see what is fresh, local, and in season. They seem to stick to those criteria when selecting their fruit and vegetables, so in my effort to seek this out, they certainly make it easier for me. The local (like down the street in Findlay gardens) as well as more traveled items, are usually labeled. As I am not 100% committed to eating only local, I recognize the need to bring some things in. That said, I can't recall a time when I bought something that came to me any further than Mexico (usually my avocados), which is unique in a grocery store. \n\nThough I would definitely categorize this as a grocery store in its variety of food (fresh fruit, veg, packaged goods, sauces, stocks, dairy, cheese, eggs, etc.) sold, it doesn't have any of the overwhelming feeling of a \"normal\" store. An accurate description might be the EDGE of the grocery store, which is where I shop anyhow, so it works for me. Additionally, I trust that the products they carry are tried and true since they don't have room to stock many brands of one item.I also know that they are receptive to customer feedback and suggestions, which is nice to see when you need something that can be harder to find. Overall, the space is charming to me, but can get crowded. \n\nThe owners and people who work at Madison's are, perhaps, the best part of the experience (which is hard to admit when fresh food is so important to me). Mr. and Mrs. Madison are about as adorable and helpful as they come. Though I certainly don't know them personally, they have never been anything but kind, entertaining, and friendly. If they were my grandparents, I assume I'd be pretty satisfied. The other folks working in the store, as well, are always available to answer questions (off the wall and otherwise) and point me in the right direction (for a small store, I am sometimes confounded by where I would find 'x'). \n\nThe items I really like at Madison's include: gelato, MadPops, seasonal fresh fruits, stocks, Snowville Creamery milk/creamer, and Grateful Grahams. \n\nOne last kudos to Madison's in their endeavor to sell fresh foods, which was pointed out to me, is that they are the only fruit/veg stand at Findlay that is also air conditioned. I had made a comment to the staff about previous experiences \"shopping around\" at the various stands, but seeming to come back to them because they had the least spoilage. They pointed out that this is likely an important difference in my experience; I'm sold. If something does go bad, as well, they are happy to replace it for you. Good customer service!\n\nThe entire experience at Madison's can be quick and easy- in and out- or you can take your time, browsing, chatting, and comparing notes. It's a bit of what I'd imagine \"stores used to be like\", and I'm happy to be a routine customer.",

      "text": "This is one place I visit nearly weekly (especially March-October).  They are dedicated to their customers and I feel like I'm always surprised/impressed by the variety of items offered in this small space.  Some of the highlights of my experiences:\n\n-Location labeling/Local spending.  Most all of the produce is labeled with its origin which helps me feel better.  Sometimes, you just need an avocado, and while it may not have been grown local, at least I can feel good about my money staying local.\n\n-Small (and large) quantities available.  It is here you can buy a single stalk of celery.  I LOVE this.  Sometimes, you just need a carrot or stalk of celery for a recipe and this is the place to get it (for fifteen cents).  I can seriously find almost any produce that I need here-though I haven't tried it, this also seems like a place that would order a large quantity for you if you had a need.  And you can always ask if you don't find what you need and Mr. Madison will let you know either where it is or why they don't have it.\n\n-Dry goods.  Easily missed, behind the counter and back wall, they have a fairly expansive stock of dry grains, nuts, the like (even vanilla beans at Christmas).  The staff are happy to help you with whatever it may be-a quarter cup of quinoa or 4 pounds of oats.  This makes it super easy to try new things, or again, source a recipe.\n\n-Staff/Proprietors.  The staff are always super helpful and attentive.  This place can get busy and crowded, and it could get easy to get frustrated as a staff person in that environment.  But, it my experience, they do what they can to help everyone quickly and direct new comers of the order of the line, or spend time getting your list of 43 bulk dry goods.\n\nThe only point that might annoy newcomers is that this place is a bit small, and on a Saturday morning (especially in winter) it can get crowded.  (PS the line starts in the back-see the sign hanging from the ceiling.) But, here's a tip-I've never tried it, but I do certainly have a bookmark from them that advertises that you can call in your order ahead of time during the week.  Some day, I imagine I might be organized enough to do this.  Also, during most of the summer, they have a tent outside with the larger quantities of seasonal produce which alleviates the crowd.",

They make sure to stock up on fruits and veggies that are in season, so you're getting the best tasting and freshest product possible.

Their gelato, unfortunately doesn't taste anything, and I stress the word \"anything\", like the authentic gelato from Italy. Their gelato tastes like normal ice cream. I couldn't tell the difference between ice cream and their gelato. It still tastes good though, which is why it earned 2 stars from me, but this is not gelato. Gelato has a creamier, more intense, dense flavor and is less airy. The intensity of the flavor comes from the fact of this lack of air vs. ice cream, which has a lot of air making it light and fluffy. \n\nThe taste is great, but because it is not gelato, Madisono's Gelato only gets 2 stars from me.",

      "text": "Madison's has a bizarre assortment of specialties: gourmet cheeses, fresh mushrooms, gelato, organic milk and meat, local fruits/veggies.  I'm glad they've never tried to blend those.  As such, their store in Findlay Market could reasonably sustain you, though I prefer more variety than they offer.  Fortunately there are plenty of other vendors to fulfill my needs for cured meats and a panoply of vegetables.\n\nBecause it's a small volume stand, some of the produce can get a little old.  This is bad if you don't notice it but good when they do notice it; you can usually find some sort of special price for, say, browning bananas.  They do a nice job of getting seasonal specialties (meyer lemons, black truffles, rhubarb), so the selection is continually changing.\n\nBut let's be honest; the gelato freezer is the treasure here.  With magnificent flavors like lemon basil or lilikoi (a combination of passion fruit and coconut that sends me into delirium), Madison's iced treats should be your sweet lover this summer.  I recommend one of each, but here are a few specific suggestions:\nFor the breakup, the dark chocolate orange.\nFor after yard work, the pink grapefruit.\nFor casual snacking, the black cherry.\nFor elegance, the hazelnut.\nI could go on.  For every time there is a proper gelato at Madison's.",

Get out of town!\n\nSome packaged goods are a little more expensive than at a big chain, but that's pretty much to be expected. \n\nThere are bins of grains and nuts and such that you can buy by the pound.\n\nThey also have a special deal where on Wednesday and Fridays (there might be another day, too) if you spend $15 you get a free carton of eggs (or $1.50 off your order).  Also the people that work there are friendly. \n\nThe gelato will rock your world.

This store has all of the staples like pasta, ketchup, tortilla chips, milk, OJ, and coffee beans that you won't find in the various produce, meat, bread, and restaurant stands at Findlay Market. A real bonus here is that they've also got a pretty good selection of fresh produce, fresh herbs, and mushrooms. If you go back by the registers there's also bulk beans and seeds as well as rice and coffee.\n\nThe store can get pretty hectic on the weekend, so if it looks like they're out of something, ask someone that works there. The staff is extremely friendly and they'll be happy to check to see if they've got something in the back.\n\nBe sure to grab a basket from the floor by the front door on your way in.

While I'm in there, I will frequently pick up other things, like fresh produce or feta cheese or what have you. I will say, because of its size (and the fact that Americans are now used to shopping in supermarkets, which have huge lanes for the huge carts and huge parking lots for your huge SUVs...sorry, I digress). But it's a small shop, and if you can possibly help it, don't go on a weekend when it's packed, because it IS difficult to get around in there, especially when loaded down with grocery bags. But they try to keep things local, which I love--and honestly, I love the idea of the small shop.\nPro tip: if you shop during the week and buy over a certain amount (like $15), you get a small discount!",

First the manager loudly announces to us I'm locking the door so when you want to leave I will have to unlock it for you and she was obviously unhappy. When we left at 11:15 another employee tossed up his hands and said in a loud angry voice that he needed to unlock it for us. Then he proceeded to tell us \"for future reference you shouldn't come in after 10:50 again.\" We were all stunned. I replied or never again to which he responded he was just kidding. Clearly he was not. Customer service seems to be a thing of the past here. They cleaned and broke down stuff while we ate our cones. It didn't bother us one bit.

      "text": "Norris Schloffen (not real name) is a representation of everything wrong with the ice cream industry. This employee, although young and hip, is a disgrace not only to this establishment, but also to himself. I mean honestly, how hard can it be to make a brownie sundae. Get out the bowl, slap a brownie in that bad boi, warm it up with a microwave, which has got to be the easiest to use heating device apart from setting things on the ground on a sunny day, drop some vaniller iced cream in that mothertrucker, drizzle those tasty toppings across that now melting vaniller iced cream, and shimmy it across that lil countertop to the eager customer. If he would have completed these tasks, I would have left him a tip. Mr. Schloffen is two bucks poorer cuz of this display of poor sundae assembly skills. Lemme tell ya what happened in this poor excuse for an ice cream parlor so you can get behind the boycott I am calling for. I order the brownie sundae, and as I wait (more than 40 seconds) he proceeds to NOT WARM UP THE BROWNIE. Now what the heck is that. Seriously, how am I expected to eat this brownie sundae with a flimsy plastic spoon when the brownie part is so hard I could use it to carve my name into a tree in a national forest. I proceeded to dig into the Sundae after it arrived to me, even though the preparation lacked precision, and displayed an utter lack of attention to detail. I pressed the plastic spoon into the broad side of this \"sundae\" and was greeted with a resistance like no other. I pushed and poked from every angle imaginable, watching as the plastic stretched, deforming my poor spoon. After a long struggle with this small cylindrical brownie, the spoon broke. A plastic spoon breaking trying to eat a sundae from Greater's. Utterly absurd. Anyways, I proceeded to disassemble the brownie with the knife in my multi-tool (courtesy of the Swiss army). After I had sufficiently saturated my knife with the secret sauce that is Greater's vaniller iced cream, I reluctantly shoved the device back into my pocket, prepared for an uncomfortable and sticky removal later on. I went up, asked a different employee (not Mr. Schloffen) for a spoon. They gave it too me. I thanked them. Sat down and finished that wretched bowl of \"worm ridden filth\" (courtesy of my brothers recommendation to quote Star Wars). Anyways back to the story, it sucked, Norris can't serve iced creme worth a rats pajamas, and if you ever pay a visit, do not get anything to dessert on, it will only serve to disappoint you.",

      "text": "While house hunting before we made the move to Cincinnati a few months ago, one of the housing representatives recommended that we try LaRosa's and Graeter's.  We made it to LaRosa's during that visit, but we weren't able to visit Graeter's until we'd already completed the move. Luckily, there is one a short drive away that we've been to a few times already. We were told that we had to try the Black Raspberry Chip, and we finally did just that last week.  Good stuff!  The raspberry flavor is refreshing, and the chocolate chunks are yummy, not hard chunks of chocolate like you too often find in ice cream like this.  \n\nThis location is clean and inviting with an enticing display of pastries.  The manager is friendly and personable and I have enjoyed every visit here.",

      "text": "Not sure if this is the right location of Graeter's that I visited, but I don't think it matters because I am sure all of them are equally as awesome.\n\nBottom line, Graeter's serves up some of the richest, creamiest ice cream around. So if you are not a fan of rich and creamy, stay away. \n\nThe BF is Cincinnati-born and bred, and he has been raving about Graeter's for years. I got to sample a bit when he brought back some pints for me to try, but nothing beats freshly scooped Graeter's in a sugar cone.\n\nI was in Cincy for just a weekend and visited Graeter's twice in two days. The first time, I ordered a scoop of black cherry on a cone. The girl working there told me that they were introducing black cherry chip this month, and would I like to try that instead? OK! I guess they introduce temporary new flavors each month? \n\nThe \"chips\" in the ice cream are really more like \"nuggets.\" They include a generous amount of chocolate in the chip flavors, and in big pieces, too. The black cherry chip flavor was divine. It was chock-full of juicy black cherries and chunks of chocolate. MMMM!\n\nMy second visit, I got Elena's Blueberry Pie. Each Blueberry Pie sale benefits The Cure Starts Now Foundation. I've had Mayfield's blueberry pie ice cream, and it doesn't even compare. Graeter's version has fresh WHOLE blueberries and what appears to be sugar cookie pieces, though the website says they are pie crust pieces. \n\nOh, I was also shocked at the low prices in the store. For example, a single scoop will cost you $2.75. That is significantly cheaper than ice cream places in Atlanta (*ahem* Paolo's with your $5 scoops and Kilwin's!) The BF said their prices have remained the same for years.\n\nThey sell cookies, candies and even bread in the store. I am not entirely sure if they have cake; I can't quite remember. On top of the ice cream selections, they have sundaes and milkshakes. \n\nI also sampled vanilla, mint chocolate chip, cookies & cream and mocha chocolate chip. I believe you might find pints of Graeter's at Kroger locations. All of them were incredibly good. I just wish they weren't so high in calories and fat! Half a cup is a whopping 300 calories. :(",

So we stood there waiting for someone to ask us our order after 5 minutes of staring at the employees I finally placed an order for a shake. I have never seen it take 10 minutes to make a shake, but I patiently waited. After the shake was done I was ready to place another order but the employee decided that he had better things to do and started off on another adventure. So after waiting another 3minutes he never came back. So we left the shake on the counter and drove over to the colerain location. Now that place deserves 5stars.",

It's a little on the pricey side for ice cream, but OH SO worth it. If I had enough money to have it regularly shipped out to California (do they do this?!?!?) I would in a second.

Sarah Jessica Parker once named Graeter's as her favorite ice cream, and nearly all Cincinnatians would agree with her expert celebrity opinion. \n\nIf you even remotely like ice cream, you owe it to yourself to try Graeter's fantastic (still!) hand-churned ice cream, with giant chunks of semi-sweet chocolate and some of the best flavor combinations I've ever tasted. The Buckeye Blitz is my all-time favorite, basically tasting like a buckeye candy in ice cream form. Combine that with a Snyder's pretzel cone and I can't imagine a sweet tooth that wouldn't be satisfied. Seasonal flavors are offered all year round; the pumpkin ice cream is always a hit around town.\n\nGraeter's is also host to an assortment of confections and baked goods if you're in need of either, but the main attraction here is no doubt the ice cream.",

      "text": "Simply Rolled's concept of ice cream is both unique and delicious. The finished product is just about the only good thing about this business though. It's a shame as they could be capitalizing on a high demand, but instead Simply Rolled is far too understaffed to make this a quick enjoyable place to get some ice cream. \n\nMy wife and I visited on a Friday night. We waited just under 30 minutes for our ice cream. You can call ahead to order, yet the two folks that I noticed come in for their call ahead orders were informed their ice cream wasn't ready and they would need to wait as well. Oh, and there were about 6 DoorDash orders that the workers would alternate preparing between the orders for the customers in the store. \n\nWith only two people working, they were visibly stressed and overwhelmed. Preparing a single bowl takes about 6-7 minutes I'd guess. When a party of four walked in, I could see the dread in one of the worker's eyes as he glanced at the clock. I truly felt bad for them. They need help. Yes, it was a busy Friday night, but this is always the case anytime I visit. Even on weeknights. \n\nMy wife received her order first and waited, and waited, and waited for mine to be ready so we could enjoy together. It somewhat ruined the experience. Not to mention the overall vibe of a bunch of people sitting around awkwardly also thinking \"wow, this is taking forever.\"\n\nIf you're going to implement a business where each serving takes about 8-10 minutes per customer including payment, hire the appropriate amount of staff to facilitate that structure. I like the ice cream. I really do. But the wait and overall experience outweighs the tasty little rolls. Bolster your staffing to accommodate the clear demand.",

      "text": "What a fun way to serve ice cream!\nThe process of making a custom single serve from liquid base to frozen goodness is fascinating to watch.\nIt is a Korean concept, that utilizes chilling plates. Once the creamy base is poured over them, it gets mixed with optional goodies and then turns into a thin layer of ice cream, that can be scraped off into yummy tubes and topped with whatever you wish for.  \nThe customization options are endless, from different flavors of the base, through mix-ins, to toppings. They have some suggested options that are always good too.\nNow, in October, they offer a seasonal pumpkin flare.\nOnce you choose what you want, you need to be very patient and wait in line, and the line is always there. The wait time is the only downside, but they always have 3 people on 3 freezing plates working non stop.\nIt is fairly laborious to prepare each portion, so even though it comes at $6.50 per cup, I always tip generously, as it is not the same as scooping some gelato from a container.\nI like this location near Washington Park, you can grab the treat and stroll through the park while enjoying it.",

I was not super hyped about rolled ice cream but I LOVE cookie dough so I was excited for that. The first time I stopped here I wanted a snack for an event in the park and decided to try a cup of the basic cookie dough with m&ms.  It was a mistake. I only had a few bites and ended up going somewhere else for food. The dough tasted average but was very dry and not enjoyable.  Next time I will try it with the ice cream but as one of the options advertised is edible cookie dough I was hoping I could enjoy it independently as I do at other places/home. Overall, I will go again because I don't want to waste my gift card but so far it seems like it looks better than it tastes.",

She then yelled, mind you stopped in the middle of helping another customer & said \"I need to see your vaccination card then,\" which I then looked at my younger brother & boyfriend & we all agreed that 1) Her tone 2) We didn't feel the need to have our integrity questioned when we followed the rules & lastly 3) it IS a HIPPA violation to ask a citizen to see their vaccination card or any medical documentation for that matter unless it is within a healthcare setting which I believe an ice cream shoppe is not. :) Will not be returning here - not because they wanted us to wear a mask, but the way they went about it. Please get a hold of your employees & talk to them about going about it in a respectful manner. Everyone is human & we were just trying to have a nice night walking the town & this completely ruined it. I will be calling the CDC & local PD to file a report of them asking for our medical documentation as that is not allowed & don't want other to feel victimized as we did. :-)",

I feel like I've been living a sheltered existing until now.\n\nRecommended by a friend, we stopped in for a little dessert after dining nearby. Wow! Not only is the ice cream heavenly, it's also an experience. You can stand and watch the staff create your selection -- sort of like a Japanese restaurant where the entrees are prepared right at your table.\n\nFor my first visit, I ordered the Salty Caramel Pretzel. Yum! I enjoyed each and every bite. My husband chose the \"create your own\" path with a brownie batter base, peanut butter cups and hot fudge. I didn't try a bite but it sure looked delicious. When we go back, I'm dying to try to Strawberry Serenity.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? They're open until 10 pm Sunday through Thursday and until 11 on Friday and Saturday. Your ice cream utopia awaits. Bon appetit!",

      "text": "I was cautiously optimistic about Simply Rolled Ice Cream. Part of me I was worried that this would just be a gimmick. The other part of me was excited to try rolled ice cream. While it might be a gimmick, it's a gimmick that has solid flavors behind it. Choose an ice cream base, and mix-ins. The liquid base and mix-ins are worked over a cooling plate until the liquid solidifies. The ice cream is then shaped into a rectangle. The roll-in of your choice is drizzled over the ice cream. From there, the concoction is rolled into the signature shape. Unlimited toppings may be added. \n\nI was really impressed with the flavor. Rather than one of their listed Creations I opted for the create your own option. I did matcha green tea base, with almonds and raspberries for mix-ins, lavender honey for the roll-in, and blueberries as a topping. The ice cream was rich and creamy. Having it rolled adds extra aeration; it really helps you taste the different flavors. The amount of matcha flavoring was just enough. Fresh raspberries added a bit of tartness. Allmonds added a bit of texture. To my delight, the lavender honey did not meld into the ice cream. It acted as little bursts of sweetness. Blueberries were the icing on the cake, so to speak.\n\nSimply Rolled is a short walk from Washington Park. When the park gets too hot, walk over to Simply Rolled and enjoy a sweet treat.",

My favorite part about Simply Rolled was how great the customer service was. It was a pretty quiet night when we arrived and the staff made sure to go out of their way and greet us with a warm welcome. be warned the even on a quiet night it still took a little bit for our water to come out. I think that's standard though and had nothing to do with the staff themselves they seem to be working diligently. I have no complaints about the service that was provided.\n\nUnfortunately, the biggest downfall for me was the ice cream itself. The ice cream lacks the depth and creaminess that I like in my favorite ice creams. It almost tasted watery (maybe that's required to get it in these cute little rolls?). Don't get me wrong, it tasted good. However, if I'm going to splurge on ice cream then I want to make sure that the caloric intake is worth it. With that being said, I think I'd go elsewhere. I would definitely give them another shot, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing?",

      "text": "Best part: taste. They nail it when it comes to actual taste. Kiddo and I shared an Oreo dish and it was so good. I know you come for the experience but their ice cream could look like a regular scoop and it would still be worth trying. \n\n2nd best part: experience. They call your name so you can come up and watch them make it, atleast I assume that's why they call your name. Super cool to see the bases freeze up and the ingredients chopped in. The rolling is cool but not as satisfying as Instagram makes it. \n\nNegative: it's 62 degrees inside the shop, understandably since it is an ice cream shop but it was seriously unbearable to eat inside. I was shivering. Unfortunately, they have no seating outside so you have to deal with the temp or walk and eat. Not so easy with a toddler. \n\nOther negative: the rolls really keep their ice cold temperature, I had a hard time eating the rolls. I found that I had to wait a few minutes for it to melt first. Not really a big deal but noteworthy, it's hard to just dig on in. \n\nIf I was ever in OTR and wanted (pricey) ice cream, I'd come back, mostly because it really did taste delicious. It's a cool, clean place and the Thailand inspired rolling did not disappoint. \n\nPro tip: order the root beer float and watch the root beer freeze instantly, it's super cool (and yummy).",

It's among the many novelty ice cream shops around. It is different however, it reminded me of Cold Stone where you can mix your favorite toppings in fresh ice cream. \n\nI recommend starting with one of their pre-builts before getting into the build your own, but if you go down that path the options are endless. \n\nI got the banana-Nutella, but replaced the vanilla ice cream with chocolate. I also added strawberries. It was amazing. My wife really enjoyed the Thai Tea Rolls. There were more flavors I can't wait to give a try. 4-Stars only due to price. \n\nIt's staying on the list for a good date night.",

The process of making these rolls was reminiscent to me of the Cold stone creamery back in the day only they roll this ice cream. It is mesmerizing to watch. I loved my creation and bonus, Color.

The wide windows and white interior make it look fresh and spacious, despite the lack of sitting (there were only 3 tables when we went in). Because it is widely popular and in a good location, it can get hectic and the line can move slowly as the production of rolled ice cream takes some time. There are plenty of good preset options and it also allows you to make your own. I personally loved the matcha berry (option number 6) as it is very refreshing and sweet. The biggest downside would be that the flavor can feel watered down on some occasions. There were times I had a great creamy flavor and other times I felt I was eating ice with some topping on it. It is a great place nonetheless and a good addition to the neighborhood. I would encourage people to try it at least two or three times due to the flavor inconsistency though.",

BUT after seeing some goodies that I trust post about this spot, I caved and decide to give it a try. After stopping by OTR Escape Room with the whole crew (And KILLING our mission), we all stopped by for a celebratory treat. This place is dope! \n\nIt's a captivating experience to watch them make your individualized rolled icecream right before your eyes - and it's delicious! I suggest the #2, vanilla icecream with strawberries with graham crackers (or check out the seasonal treats the Red Velvet is niiiice). \n\nI believe that this trend is here to stay. \nAnd I'm rolling with it!",

They do clean their utensils after each use, and they scrape down the mixing surface, but not well enough that I'd be confident in saying there wouldn't be any cross contamination.

      "text": "I've never tried rolled ice cream and was so excited to finally be able to try it! I'm not sure if was a bad day for them or they were feeling overwhelmed by the amount of customers, but my experience was not good. The service was poor and the ice cream appearance and taste was mediocre at best.\n\nWhen I first entered there was about a line of 10 people and the front line seemed a little frazzled. Since it was my first time ever ordering at a rolled ice cream place, I wanted to ask the cashier some questions. She immediately dismissed them and was not friendly. Once I ordered I asked her where I should wait and she told me to stand in the back. This was incorrect as I should have waited at the front line area. \n\nWhen the party I was with and I heard my name called, I went to grab the order which appeared to be mine and immediately was told it wasn't for me. I then questioned \"where is my order\", because the person who took the order was in line after me. As a response, from I believe to be the manager, I received an eye roll, a shrug and a finger point. This is completely unacceptable service and is something that must be worked on. Remember you serve the customer, the customer doesn't serve you. \n\nLastly for the price I'd expect a beautifully designed descent tasting creation. The rolls were off and messy, not even \"instagram worthy\". The ice cream was also overly dense with suppressed flavors. To be fair, I've only tried the Gone Bananas signature roll, so maybe the others are better. A larger serving per topping should be added for the price.\n\nThe only positives are they have a cool menu and offer a variety of different signature creations as well as the option to create your own. In theory this ice cream joint is a great idea, but executed unsuccessfully. By working on your service, more employee training, and giving larger topping servings, your rating will definitely improve. \n\nI'll revisit and write a review within a couple months to see if any modifications were made.",

A friend and I split the Cookie dough boy signature bowl and it was enough to hit our sweet tooth. \nThe ice cream itself was good, and the cookie dough that was mixed in was spot on. Love the color changing spoons! I do wish the base held up a bit more, because it melted quickly. It was refreshing. I would suggest trying one with a fruit base or a chocolate base for more flavor. \nThe experience of watching them make the ice cream is fun and they have a whole line where you can watch. This can get congested since they do not direct you to a specific spot to wait and get your ice cream. Also, all the workers who roll differ in how they scoop-I would've liked to see a tighter ice cream roll, because I think they may have been rushing. \nOverall, it was good, and I want to come back to try and create my own bowl.",

The instant I walked in, I was yelled at (YES, yelled at!!!) by the cashier because she thought I was ignoring the 10 person capacity sign, when I was really peaking my head in to see how many people are inside because the windows are tinted! \nOnce enough people left for me and my group to walk in, the same cashier greeted me with a not-so-friendly stare that made it obvious that she didn't want me there. One of the people in my group didn't have a mask with him. Instead of being nice and asking him if he has a mask, she yelled \"put on your mask!\", and when he nicely explained that he didn't have a mask, she pointed to the door and glared at him. \nThroughout my 20+ minute wait for the ice cream (remember, we were 4 of about 8 customers in there at that point), we saw the same lady yelling at other visitors and also noticed how deliberately rude she was- she wouldn't say anything nice to anyone, not even giving a simple \"you're welcome\" to the cute little 5 year old sisters who watched her roll ice cream in amazement. I felt bad for the other girl working, she always had her head down and it could be assumed that the cashier treats her with the same disrespect that she treats her customers. \nIt's amazing how one person can so badly harm a business by refusing to do the simple task of giving friendly service. And for that reason, I will not return and I will recommend that others steer clear of this place. I hope this review was helpful!",

You can add sauces and they make the beautiful ice cream rolls and add any additional toppings or sauces on top of that too. I'll definitely be going back soon... even if winter is coming...",

You think ice cream in Cincinnati, you may think of the big G, but Aglamesis is also at the top of the list when it comes to original local ice cream offerings and has been for over 100 years. \n\nThe ice cream is rich and creamy, and they also have refreshing Italian Ice if that is more your thing. The staff is very friendly and quick. This location is doing an excellent job of implementing covid precautions. Which currently I do not believe they are offering indoor seating, they usually do, but they do have tables and chairs set up outside for when it's nice out. \n\nShould you be in the mood for gourmet chocolate and/or other sweets, check the entire left side of the store and you'll be sure to find something. \n\nI'm a huge fan of Cream-n-cookies ice cream!",

I've lived in Cincinnati my entire 20 years up until college, have tried every ice cream parlor in the city, and can confidently confirm that Aglamesis is THE BEST!\n\nAglamesis has been open for as long as I can remember and has the most classic, beautiful parlor interior. When you walk in, you automatically smell the chocolates, candy, and ice cream and feel right at home. The employees are all extremely friendly and will remember your family and your name! \n\nIf you haven't been, theres plenty of things you must try... but you really have to try to BANANA ICE CREAM. I really don't even like bananas that much but their banana ice cream is heavenly. I normally get the banana milkshake that comes with two little butter cookies, which is adorable. My parents always split the two-step, which is like an ice cream sundae for two, and they always love it! My brother swears by the strawberry ice cream, you should try that as well!",

      "text": "So here is my updated thesis\nI do not have psycho-kinesis\nBut the best ice cream I know\nDown in Cinci Ohio\nIs the strawberry here at Aglamesis!\n\nIf Ronaldo was merged with Messi, you'd either have a really short Ronaldo, or A-Glam-Messi.\n\nThis is a really lovely ice cream shop with really good fresh strawberry ice cream. I enjoyed every slurp of it. The boy serving was really friendly and the girls serving was really flirtatious and had a crush on me. Unfortunately they didn't seem to get along and they were arguing and annoyed with each other. That's okay because the boy can be my bro and chill with me and the girl can be my date presuming that she is over 21 which I'm pretty sure she was. Fun times all around.\n\nShe helped me pick out the fresh strawberry ice cream flavour which was delicious, as was she.\n\nWhile I was waiting for my ice-cream some guy was quoting The Wedding Singer so I called him on it and then we had a little chat. More good times all around.\n\nLots of cute people come to this particular cafe so watch out Cincinnati. You have been warned.\n\nExcellent ice cream, I'll be back sometime to try a different flavour. Bear in mind this is old fashioned style ice cream with traditional flavours so don't expect stupid maple-bacon crap here. Otherwise I probably wouldn't like it as much. I'm all for quality products not fancy innovation for the sake of it unless it tastes amazing.\n\nMy alt review said:\n\nSuper cute ice cream place in Cincinnati with a legendary following and extremely attractive customers and really friendly teenybopper employees. I enjoyed my experience here thoroughly and I will probably bring Barbie back here for ice cream next time I'm in Cincinnati especially considering the city isn't absolutely packed with great ice cream places like for example Buffalo and Toronto.\n\nExtremely friendly employees who deserve the tip that I gave them and while parking out front can be a little tricky it's worth coming here for people watching as well cuz it's in a very trendy neighborhood with lots of cool people and trendy people and Suburban people all mixed in together checking each other out.\n\nAn excellent addition to the lifestyle of Cincinnati and one which I recommend everybody check out when you're in town if you like ice cream.",

The people were very rushed and seemed to be annoyed by any questions that were asked. \n\nI got butter pecan ice cream and got my dog the dog ice cream. My dog seemed to enjoy the ice cream (vanilla ice cream with dog biscuits). My ice cream though, I thought was nothing too special. I really wish they had more variety of flavors. \n\nI like the idea of having an option for your dog as Oakley is very dog friendly, but it was nothing too exciting that makes me want to come back consistently.",

It is an authentic old-fashioned ice cream parlor that has been around since the 1920s. They have beautiful marble-topped tables and wire-backed chairs, and the place smells like chocolate! I always get the two-step hot fudge sundae, which comes with French vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, fresh whipped cream, and nuts. They also have delicious shakes and ice cream sodas. This is a great place to bring kids (big ones, too!) for a yummy dessert.",

      "text": "After passing by this spot a few times I finally decided to stop in on a hot afternoon. Like any other ice cream shop, I first went up to the counter and started looking at the flavor choices. I was then told that this was actually a full-service store, and so those dining in could sit at a table with a menu and have a server come ane take the orders. \n\nWhile the service was a nice touch, I actually felt apprehensive about it. First of all, it didn't allow me to look into the big cooler of ice cream choices to help me make a decision. Also, we were not aware of the 4 seasonal choices not listed on the menu until our server mentioned them (after we had already been looking at the menu for a while).\n\nI went with the seasonal strawberry chip. While it was refeshing, it was a bit icy and not as creamy as I expected. Also, the scoop was pretty small for the price. \n\nIf you're looking to splurge on an ice cream trip in Cincinnati, stick to Graeter's.",

When I tasted it I was like meh ok it's good but I wasn't super wowed as I am with eating Graeter's. They also do not have a large selection of ice creams. I'm use to ice cream shops having 20+ options they have 17 flavors with a few Italian Ice flavors. Their flavors are also pretty basic (I.e. Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, Strawberry Chocolate Chip, Mint Chocolate Chip, Banana Ice Cream, Banana Chocolate Chip, Etc.). This is not a big deal as I usually only order 2 flavors ever. I just wanted to state that to give people a heads up. They also are a chocolate candy shop. \n\nI tried one scoop of Cream-n-Cookies. It was pretty good. The ice cream had a nice texture and creaminess. I only had one little chunk of Oreo. I would have definitely liked more cookie chucks. It tasted like your standard cookies and cream. No big complaints but no real super brags either.\n\nOverall, Aglamesis Bros isn't bad and has good ice cream. While I did enjoy their ice cream I probably will continue to go to Graeter's.",

Greek immigrants invented Cincinnati chili and the Aglamesis family created this ice cream, chocolate and candy store. \n\nMy mother was an Aglamesis loyalist; she went to school with their family. It was a very special spot for us wide-eyed children to reward us for good behavior after adult events we did not necessarily relish. \n\nAglamesis ice cream is a little different than \"the other\" ice cream business in town. Both are excellent, by the way! Both use the same high quality ingredients. Both have a rotating collection of flavors, including sorbets. \n\nAglamesis ice cream has more air, so is less dense. That makes it easier to consume! \n\nAglamesis is not as sweet as the other, it's a more adult ice cream to me.\n\nInterestingly my mother's loyalty to Aglamesis overrode her mother's loyalty to \"the other\" ice cream business. They both were independent women! They both were always there for us. And as kids, we eagerly consumed both ice creams!\n\nFrom Aglamesis I learned how to make chocolate chip flavors. After the ice cream is done with the dasher process, remove the dasher, then pour in melted chocolate, stirring it in with a long spoon. The chocolate will immediately flake into chips with the size determined by the speed you stir. Then put the ice cream away to freeze firm. \n\nI've always enjoyed their seasonal cranberry sorbet!\n\nThis original store hasn't changed since 1913. They have a huge selection of cordials, truffles and bonbons. The shop is a scent experience.\n\nI had the mint chocolate chip - excellent - I have made this ice cream with creme de menthe liquor, which is difficult because alcohol is an antifreeze, freezing point depressant.\n\nNext, the black raspberry chocolate chip - I think we call those blackberries out West! It has a great strong fruit flavor, tart and not too sweet - yum.\n\nFinally, I had the champagne sorbet with a lemon flavor and pale pink color - also excellent!\n\nThis place is popular with families, for a date, or just to cool off. And for atmosphere, you can't beat their authenticity. \n\nThe only improvement I would make is to add espresso!",

The staff is super courteous and the ice cream flavors and quality are delightful (we shared a sundae with a combo banana chip and raspberry chip). We also bought some chocolate truffles for my grandmother, which she confirmed tasted as scrumptious as they looked. Even my dog got spoiled afterward with a \"pup cup\" he devoured without coming up for air after we got home (a trip that single scoop made home fully intact 20 minutes later thanks to some kind of space-age paper bag).",

      "text": "It's really hard for me for some reason to review my favorite places. I guess I feel like, in words, I could never do these places justice to how amazing they are. \nAglamesis Bros is one of those places. \n\nI fell in love with Aglamesis Bros before I even ate there. Two years before I even moved down to Cincinnati I was at a concert at the 21st Century Theater and when walking back to my car this little ice cream shop caught my eye with its gold lettering in the window and it's pastels inside the background. I never forgot about it. Then two years later when I moved down to Cincinnati, my boyfriend and I went on one of our first dates at Aglamesis Bros. When we walked in I was in \"Awe\", it made me think of \"The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg\", and that movie is what my heart and head look like inside. Haha. \n\nMy top three favorite things to get at Aglamesis is. 1. Champagne Sorbet (Italian Ice), you will never have a better sorbet in your life. I also really enjoy getting one scoop of Champagne Sorbet, and one scoop of Raspberry Sorbet. They compliment each other and are amazing. 2. Sodas, Old school style soda's. My favorite thing to do suggest to my guess to try one out. They usually pick \"Extra Sincere\" and I love seeing their face when they bring out the giant goblet out to the table. Always funny. 3. Sundaes, Any of their sundaes, with crushed fruit topping is my favorite. The pineapple is really good, but my favorite is the Maraschino Cherry Chocolate Sundae.\n\nThey also have amazing homemade chocolates and candies. The Malt Balls are my favorite. If you ever want to just try a candy that you are unsure of, they will let you taste it too. \n\nDuring the holidays, you can always go in here and find plenty of candy goodies. Valentines Day, even though I don't celebrate it. I do love seeing the assortment of heart-shaped candy boxes you can pick out of, and you get to pick what candies you want them too. Easter is another holiday they go all out for. \n\nThe service is also always top notch here. Everyone is always ridiculous nice and helpful. I also think it's amazing that my boyfriend lost my American Apparel hoodie, we couldn't find it for a year and then one day we were at Aglamesis and I was walking back to the bathroom, and low and behold on the wall hanging up on their coat rack was my hoodie that I've had for almost ten years. They kept my hoodie that I lost that whole time. \n\nI love LOVE, love Aglamesis Bros. They have perfected ice cream. They are my favorite ice cream place ever.",

So, I know my frozen desserts. \n\nAglamesis Bros is like time traveling back to the 1950s or 60s. A pink paradise of small, white tables and wacky wallpaper, the decor and the menu make all ages happy. I've visited with my friends and their kids, with my mom, and, most recently, on a girls' night out. Everyone left with smiles on their faces and money still in their pockets.\n\nThe marble counter, glass candy displays, and old fashioned recipes are a welcome flashback to a simpler time. You can get things like rum raisin ice cream, Mayfield brownies (which are like hunks of nutty fudge), and caramel apples all served up by friendly folks.\n\nPrices are so low that our trio of ladies ate ourselves silly for less than $13. The berry ice was fruity and refreshing. The vanilla float was creamy and frothy. And my turtle sundae was rich and delicious. I love coming here and sharing this special pace with my friends, family, and the next generation of Cincinnati, ice cream connoisseurs.",

I replied that they do. He said this was the ice cream place he wanted to try.\n\nI had the banana chip on a waffle cone. My hubby got a sundae and since he doesn't like nuts, got them on the side and gave them to me. Banana chip ice cream with walnuts on top was great. If the banana flavor had been bumped up just a little it would have been perfect. My hubby thought the pineapple mint sauce was far better then the black raspberry chocolate chip ice cream.  He said \"the ice cream and whipped cream made my mouth feel like I had been licking butter.\" The kids scoops of ice cream come with the option of chocolate or rainbow sprinkles. My brother said it was nice. \n\nA fun experience.  The decor was adorable. Think old fashioned ice cream parlor. To go orders may be ordered at the counter, or have a seat, and a waiter will bring out a menu.  They also have a wide array of chocolates and candies.  This would be perfect for a date or even a little girl's birthday (if they do that.) Coming here and Blue Manatee bookstore a few doors down would be a great outing for a young child.",

      "text": "If you're in Cincinnati and looking for ice cream, there are two great local options that people mostly go to: Graeter's and Aglamesis. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with either, but I prefer Aglamesis. \n\nAglamesis has a great ambiance that brings you right back to the pre-1950's soda shop and ice cream parlor. The pink decor, marble countertops, and old school lighting has a *wow* factor that basically transports you to Cincinnati in the early 1900's. This place is over 100 years old, so just for nostalgia reasons you really should check it out!\n\nThe ice cream sundaes are really good. I love their hot fudge, so any of the ones with hot fudge are great. But my favorite thing to order here is their champagne sorbet. Their sorbet has a much creamier, softer texture than any other sorbet I've ever had...It truly is one of a kind. Their milkshakes are just ok in my opinion. I absolutely love that they serve all of their dishes in cute silver cups that look like they've been in use for 50 years.\n\nService is good. If you're dining in, just grab one of the tables in the back and a waitress will come take your order! Prices are a little high, but fair. Love this place!",

      "text": "I'm a huge Graeter's fan. Huge. And that's not going to change. But I couldn't not try another Cincinnati ice cream. I take ice cream very seriously and need to investigate all options.\n\nI orderd the brownie a la mode. But instead of one boring scoop of vanilla ice cream, I ordered once scoop of Black Raspberry Chip and Strawberry Chip. I usually don't get brownie sundaes at ice cream shops because I take brownies just as seriously as I take ice cream. And at most ice cream places the brownies are an after thought. They hope you won't notice that their sub-par brownie is cakey and dry because they've put their delicious ice cream on top. Well, that is certainly not the case here. Their brownies are so amazing that they are sold on their own. The consistency of this brownie is similar to fudge - super dense and rich. In my book, that's perfect. So smothering it in ice cream takes my dessert experience to a whole new level.\n\nNow, the ice cream. If ice cream doesn't have chocolate chips, I'm probably not interested. This would explain why I love Graeter's as much as I do. And obviously, no one could possibly out do their chocolate chips. All other chocolate chips are average or even unacceptable next to Graeter's. That being said, Aglamesis chocolate chips are strongly decent. Well done. Based on the three flavors I tasted, Aglamesis ice cream definitely isn't as creamy as Graeter's or as creamy as I prefer my ice cream to be. However, it wasn't at all icy - it was perfectly smooth. And it had great flavor. The Strawberry Chip was probably my favorite, but the Black Raspberry Chip was definitely yummy as well. But I can't say I was crazy about the Double Chocolate chip. It wasn't quite rich enough for my tastes and the lack creaminess just didn't do it for me.\n\nAll in all, Aglamesis is awesome and I will definitely go back and I will definitely get the Brownie a la Mode again. Probably with Strawberry Chip!",

It's a pink, well-lit, mirrored room with a classic soda fountain and chandelier. The homemade candy counter provides a vast selection of delicious candies. I love the honeycombs. The outdoor seating is pleasant during summer.\n\nI prefer cookies and cream ice cream with a side of hot fudge (to prevent melting the ice cream). They have table service which is a little strange, but that's kind of a traditional Cincinnati thing (see Skyline). They use lovely silver dishes for serving ice cream. It makes the experience just a little better.\n\nTheir shakes tend to be too thin for my taste but your mileage may vary.",

There's even a selection of sugar free though I haven't tried those.\n\nAs a side note, I'm not really into the ice cream here. I fall onto the Graeter's side.

I've got a long way to go, but I've enjoyed getting this far and hope you appreciate Yelp as much as I do. Okay, down to business. \n\nStep inside and you're transported back in time to a circa '50's ice cream parlor with a great atmosphere and even better selection of sweet stuff. I loved my experience and had difficulty deciding on what to treat myself to, sampling the seasonal Pumpkin Pie (pretty good) and then settling on a two dip cup of black cherry and cookies and cream. The ice cream was great and can safely assume that all the other flavors available are equally as yummy. \n\nThe main worker was friendly and answered all the questions I had, peppering in a few stories about the store and some of the clientele. I might have to assemble a group of ice cream lovers and attack the 8 scoop French Quarter Bonanza. It is served in a massive pimp cup of a glass and would be epic to finish.",

It is a full service ice cream parlor, which you don't come by often. Everyone was dressed to the part and I loved the Cincinnati love it showed. The sundaes were to die for. So many to offer they were just very pricey!! Double dollar sign for sure for ice cream $$. \n\nAglamesis is very easy to spot out along the street with their inviting pink décor and outside, and inside matches. My boyfriend got a chocolate malt and is was nothing but malt. A little disappointed because we were really not able to taste the ice cream because it was so malty and milky. On the plus side, they do offer you a lot of ice cream. They fill up a cute glass and then give you all the extra that was left in the mixing cup. The sundae I got was amazing! I was a brownie with fudge and caramel and pecans and whipped cream! It was a lot of toppings but again, not much ice cream, but it really was delicious. Overall it was a really good experience. I just wish I would have been able to get a real good taste of the ice cream, because I've heard such agreat things, rather than all the addatives.",

But I must admit that Aglamesis is one-of-a-kind. \n\nFirst, the store itself is so old-school. You actually sit down to order dessert from a menu. Color scheme is pink. All they need is a few booths to make it feel like you're back in the 50s. Cute place for a date, as many have probably figured out.\n\nThen, you get to indulge in the most decadent French-style ice creams you could possibly get in the Midwest without taking it straight from the cow's udder. I ordered the Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip just to see how it compares to Graeter's, and holy COW... everyone's right--the flavor is so intense. I also got a scoop of the Champagne Sorbet, which was just OK in my book (others love it, apparently). I tried my friend's seasonal Peach ice cream, and it felt like fireworks went off in my head... amazing, amazing flavor.",

I like the big creamy chocolate-y chips that are sometimes the size of mini candy bars. Don't get me wrong, Aglamesis ice cream is yummy. It's delicious. It's creamy and wonderful - but no gargantuan chips :( \n\nSo that is why they only get four stars. And I know man-friend tells me Graeter's and Aglamesis can't be compared and that they are equally good in their own right, but I can't help it! I grew up on Graeter's and I'm a chip snob. There, I said it. But I can also appreciate that it's different than Graeter's and that maybe sometimes I am in the mood for ice cream with less chip.\n\nIt's a super cute atmosphere and I love the \"old ice cream store / soda shop\" set-up they have. They also have a TON of chocolate to sell, that looked mouth-wateringly amazing. I had some of the salted chocolate covered caramel (be still my heart) and actually, I think I am going to go back and buy some as Christmas gifts for out-of-town friends! \n\nI scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream. And chocolate. And this place has both - so considering the fact that those are my two favorite desserts - and that they held up against such fierce (Graeter's) competition, I'll be back. Midwest sure does know what's up when it comes to ice cream. Glad to be back!",

One step inside and you are immediately surrounded by the amazing smells and sights of all of their chocolate, candy, and ice cream. They also had shakes, brownies, sundaes, and smoothies. YUM. It's such a bright and happy place, it just makes you feel like you were 5 again. I wanted everything!\n\nUnfortunately, my metabolism is no longer that of a 5 year old and I cannot consume everything I lay my eyes upon. So for this first visit, I decided to tone down my inner 5 year old and ordered my usual: strawberry ice cream. \n\nSince we ate in, they served our ice creams on chilled ice cream bowls. There were nice pieces of strawberries in my ice cream, which is always a plus. The ice cream itself was good but not the best I've had. It was not as creamy and smooth as other places that I have tried and was also slightly sweeter than what my taste buds normally enjoy, but that just might be me. Nonetheless, I consumed my ice cream w/in the first minute and subsequently ended up watching my friends enjoy their mocha chip and mint chocolate chip ice cream (no artificial green coloring = win). \n\nI would definitely be back to try out their sundaes if I'm ever in the area again.",

You can order at the counter for your ice cream to go. Or, you can take a seat at little tables towards the back and the servers will take your order. If you want something a little different, I would suggest a the ice cream sundae with coffee syrup. It isn't overly sweet with the slightly bitter coffee flavor.

      "text": "Nostalgia can be an interesting phenomenon.  As we get older, I suppose all of us tend to look back with some envy at our youth.  Adulthood, and all of the responsibilities that come with it, tend to make us long those simpler times.  It's a form of escapism, or at least a chance to set aside our worries for just a short amount of time.\n\nWalking in to Aglamesis, you are instantly confronted with that feeling that you've stepped out of today and back in to yesterday.  Here though, it's different.  There's nothing fake about the decor.  What's before you isn't a modern recreation, trying to manufacture those feelings of nostalgia in order to push a product.  This is real.  Genuine.  This is how it actually was, and not how someone wants you to believe things were in a past that never existed.\n\nI order my favorite, mint chocolate chip in a sugar cone, from the counter.  Sitting down at a table, I take a bite.  Suddenly, I'm seven years old again.  I'm no longer at an ice cream parlor in Cincinnati, but instead back in my home town, sitting in a booth at my local ice cream parlor, enjoying the same treat on a weekend afternoon.\n\nTo me, Aglamesis' ice cream tastes just like the treat I enjoyed many years go.   It leans more toward the \"ice\" part of the term than \"cream.\"  While it would be too far to call it gelato, it does sit in near-opposition to the creaminess of Greaters.  Each style has it's merits, and which I prefer tends to run with my mood at the time.  However, there's something about Aglamesis that strikes me differently whenever I eat it.  \n\nI'm a full-fledged adult now.  Married, children, and all the responsibilities that come with those events.  If given the opportunity, I wouldn't give all of that up to go back to being a kid again.  But every once in a while it's nice to take a few minutes, just long enough to eat a sugar cone with mint chocolate chip, and revert.  I can think of no place in Cincinnati that can do that, with genuine sincerity, like Aglamesis.",

That was me. But Aglamesis Bros is different, and takes ice cream to a whole new level. What I loved most about this place was the ice cream experience they offered. When you enter the parlor there's retro pictures and items, you feel like you are transported to the 60s, back when going to the ice cream parlor was THE Friday night activity.\nThere's a lot of discussion between which is better, Aglamesis Bros or Graeter's, but frankly they are just different. Graeter's is known for the delicious chunks of chocolate in their ice cream, while Aglamesis boasts rich and creamy ice cream. You really can't go wrong with either, but if you haven't tried one, you must.",

      "text": "Summary: If you've found Graeter's too be a little too thick, with chocolate chips that are too chunky, you've probably already discovered Aglamesis. This ends up a battle of texture and ambiance based on preferences - try both! Can't go wrong!\n\nAglamesis is styled like an old fashion ice cream parlor and has a lot of old fashioned ice cream parlor selections from Italian sodas to milkshakes. Truth be told, I find the decor cute, but it feels a little messy for my liking. The seating area is to the back of the restaurant which didn't feel as well lit, though it might just be how nice of a day it was outside.\n\nIn one word, the ice cream here is  - delicious. The ice cream served here is different than that at Graeter's. I'd classify both as premium ice cream, creamy in texture. I think Aglamesis is more creamy/less stiff than Graeter's. I find Aglamesis's ice cream to be sweeter than Graeter's and has more reasonable sized chocolate chips. As a result I prefer Graeter's, but end up at Aglamesis because the atmosphere is so special.\n\nThe waffle cones are made in house, which is delicious. I have not tried the Italian soda, but intend on one of these days. \n\nThis is a historic shop with a very good ice cream product - try it!",

My brother worked here 40 years ago and the original location was in my folks hometown of Norwood.\n\nI saw they carried their ice cream out at my first stop in town, Blue Ash Chili and now understand some of the local Kroger's carry some of their flavors too. \n\nIt's such a treat to come in, sit down and have a glass of water brought over with a menu and a friendly hello. Of course I just had to have my childhood favorite, mint chip. I really love the subtle difference in taste here from Graeter's, which is now available in Chicago.\n\nThe trick is to always get it in a cup so you can let it soften up just enough to have the flavors pop. The other trick is no cheating and tasting it too early, as it's so dang good.",

      "text": "This is my favorite ice cream parlor in Cincinnati.  The ice cream is really good and I have been enjoying it since I was a child. When I was younger, my favorite flavor was the Banana and I still love it but with age it has become harder to pick a favorite. Not long ago I tried the Butterscotch and it was amazing, though it was very sweet so be warned. My wife loves the Mocha Chip and I agree that it is one of their best flavors. I also really like the Dutch Chocolate. They also do seasonal flavors like Black Cherry or Red Raspberry and hard to find flavors like Rum Raisin.  I often pick up a couple pints and take them home but sometimes we stop in to enjoy a treat and sit inside. All the ice cream is made in small batches in the back. They also make their own chocolates and candies. They have a full case of chocolates and candies and you can purchase them one at a time or as a box of assorted ones.\n\nOne of the greatest things about Aglamesis is the experience. The outside of the building is light pink and as soon as you step inside it feels like you went back in time. Tiffany lamps, marble paneling, cute little tables and chairs, and employees in older styled uniforms. It may be the only ice cream parlor left like this in the world. If you eat inside they serve you ice cream in old fashioned stemmed metal dishes. This is a fantastic way to enjoy a banana split or a sundae. I highly recommend this to anyone that has never been. They also have great floats and even a good coffee frappe.\n\nAnd with regard to the Cincinnati discussion of whether Aglamesis or Graeter's is better, I always choose Aglamesis! I personally think that Graeter's focuses too much on the chocolate chips and not enough on the ice cream. While Aglamesis offers some flavors with chocolate chips, I mostly prefer flavors without.",

It was very good, since it was our first time, we ordered a scoop of vanilla, my brother a hot fudge sundae, and I ordered a basin sundae containing vanilla and chocolate ice cream with fudge sauce. \n\nI like how you order at the table and the employees bring the ice cream out, like at a normal restaurant, plus the ice cream is served in a silver dish. \n\nVery nice shop and employees with a lot of history, I will be in again, I however like another Cincinnati ice cream over this.",

The tiled floor and old lighting fixtures are gorgeous. The little wrought iron parlor chairs and tables really make it. You can also sit on the stools at the gorgeous marble counter.\n\nThey sell ice cream , sundaes, and milkshakes, but also have a candy counter with various chocolates and candy specialties. \n\nWhat are you waiting for!!!!!!!!

The ice cream is lighter then other Cincinnati favorites which is why I love it so much. The chips are plentiful and in every bite. I tend to get flavors other than vanilla or chocolate but when they were offering their free ice cream for the 100th anniversary I tried both. Both plain vanilla and chocolate were superb. I may order a plain chocolate scoop next time I'm there. It was that good!\n\nThe only thing I wish there could be more of is outdoor seating. We tend to stop by while walking our dog and it can be busy at times. The dog loves stopping for ice cream too because there are always other dogs around and a water bowl to quench his thirst.",

      "text": "Let me start with the fact that I don't love ice cream. It's good, but I fancy myself more of a French fry person than one who, say, enjoys sweets. Therefore, if you want to keep reading this review, let's do it! Otherwise, if you don't trust my non-discerning opinion, feel free to check out (see also: you should keep reading if only for fun).\n\nThat said, it should be no surprise that I've not been to Aglamesis Brothers in my 27+ years of life. Just this past weekend, Date and I decided that needed to be changed.\n\nLocation: planted amid the hustle and bustle of Oakley Square, Aglamesis Brothers (it's written Bros., so I will continue to write and pronounce it as \"Bros\"), an ice cream confectionery boasting a pink facade, couldn't have earned a much better location for its shoppe (I feel like it deserves the English spelling, no?). With a number of restaurants surrounding it, Aglamesis lends its perfectly dessert-like hand in a convenient location for post-meal delicacies. If you're looking to check it out after a delicious meal in the Square, walking is perfectly doable. If not, a number of parking spots are available in lots and on the street as well. \n\n[Pre-Aglamesis Bros meal suggestions in the Square: Oakley Pub for a burger, Habit's Café for any of its extensive menu, Baba India, Boca for pricier fare and valet parking, Maribelle's for a burger or brunch, or even Skyline or Dewey's for more popular chain restaurants.]\n\nAtmosphere: Sitting inside of this ice cream parlor, I felt like I was either auditioning for or had a small role in The Music Man. That's not necessarily a bad thing (I happen to really enjoy that movie); merely an observation. The interior decor is home-like and comfortable, if a little kitschy (read: way too much pink). It truly feels like a confectionery, complete with plenty of ice cream options, pastries, and candies (we got the 12-Flavor Gummy Bears which were delicious).\n\nFood: In standard ice cream form, I opted for one dip French Vanilla and one dip Holland Dutch Chocolate on a sugar cone overturned into a bowl (if an ice cream place can't master the originals, what's the point?). I could have easily done without the French Vanilla, as it was nothing to blog home about. The chocolate was very good, though, even if it reminded me a ton of Graeter's. Date decided on Mocha Chip in a rainbow jimmy-dipped waffle cone. He seemed to enjoy it, despite the ice cream making its way through the cone opening at the bottom (this was his only vocal complaint--he's kind of quiet though, so what do I know?). Next time I go, I decided I will get Banana Chocolate Chip, mostly because I've never seen it elsewhere, and secondly because they were out last time I was there (probably a good thing--it wouldn't have been awesome to have to choose between my \"regular\" and that).\n\nOverall Grade: C+ [out of a possible A+]  -- rounded up to a 4 for Yelp rating purposes.\n\nI'm really glad I finally got to try this place. While I don't particularly love ice cream (especially of the scoop persuasion), it was good enough (read: above average) and I'm sure I'll be back in the future. If you like Graeter's, you must check this place out.",

Creative and celestial flavors fit for a god like banana chocolate chip ice cream. And cinnamon ice cream. Imagine also that you can turn any one of their 20+ flavors of ice cream into a kickass sundae.

How about a 15 foot long case filled with blissful orgasmic chocolate candies. And not just any average candy. I'm talking about delectable chocolates that make Hershey and Dove chocolates taste like your grandmother's sugar free diabetes candy. Seriously, there is bourbon soaked cherry cordials, dark chocolate sea salt caramels, and award-winning chocolate covered creams.\n\nWith every day that passes my calling becomes more clear to me than ever.

I know most have an affinity for that Graet Ice Cream joint Cincy is most known for but, I love this place, it's authenticity and its tasty treats.  It definitely gives that other joint a run for it's money...\n\nY'know I once told a patron, at a previous job I held up the road, that I prefered Aglamesis taste and texture to that of the other joint (when they asked specifically for my favorite) and don't you know as I stood, with stars in my eyes, recollecting my last visit, that Richard \"you know who\", the president of that other joint, was standing right freakin' next to me... Smiling... \n\nHe introduced himself, shook my hand and thanked me for my honesty when I explained that, \"I calls 'em like I tastes 'em...\" Just sayin'...",

The champagne ice is one of my favorites and always a good pick me up that doesn't make me feel as terrible about myself as ice cream. It's like a fat free, frozen wine (not really alcoholic by the way) of happiness.\n\nNot to say their ice cream isn't good - it really is. Their chocolate is nice, smooth, and dark. Their peppermint is my second favorite in town.\n\nThe store itself is too adorable to be true and very old fashioned. It's a great place to shoot some photos in the area because it is so well maintained and set up. Service is always good.\n\nDefinitely worth stopping by. For experience and atmosphere, this beats out any other ice cream parlor around.",

I have a feeling people keep this secret to themselves should popularity somehow corrupt the purity of Aglamesis Bros'. \n\nOn a recent visit I bought a bag of malted Easter eggs and am now too spoiled to ever crave store bought ones again. I love the sampler boxes because they prevent an indecisive gal like me from spending an hour gawking at the tantalizing display case.\n\nIf you're looking for a unique Mother's Day or Valentine's Day (or any day for that matter) gift, a little sweet treat from Agalmesis would be perfect. \n\nAnother recommendation is that their lunch sandwiches are very tasty. I really enjoyed the chicken salad, but the turkey and cheese was good as well. Nothing fancy, just fresh bread and high quality ingredients. \n\nMy only minor critique is that the lemonade is very tart. Almost too tart for my liking, though that may just be a matter of taste.",

However, nothing comes close to doing that same thing in Aglamesis.\n As said before, the atmosphere is what makes this place. Sitting back, chatting with girlfriends in the retro seating area drinking an old time seltzer soda is what truly sets this place apart. I could sit here all day simply reminiscing the stories and gossip that has been told around the tables whilst drinking a delicious mocha chip soda. \n Yes, I said mocha chip soda. It's delicious - try it. My dear Maddy swears by the lime soda, but I wouldn't suggest it for the weak stomachs. It's a pretty intense concoction.\n Aglamesis is in a perfect area. There's nothing like a spring day in which you grab a bite at Habits, check out the toy and furniture stores surrounding Oakley (don't buy anything though; they're all overpriced) and ending your day drinking in old fashioned ice cream soda amongst friends in a shop that's never aged.",

You're paying for the experience as well.\n\nSome of the things I really appreciate about this place is that it's located smack-dab in the middle of the neighborhood (Oakley), it has a history spanning nearly 100 years, and it's still family owned.  In fact the last time I checked, the family that owns Algamesis Bros. are directly related to the same family that opened it so many years ago.\n\nAlgamesis Bros. is one of those hidden gems that every city has.  Lifelong residents can stumble upon this and think to themselves, \"How have I never known that this was here?\"  A great way to kill a bit of a summer afternoon.\n\nMahalo, and enjoy.",

I learned a very important thing about Aglamesis the other day..\n\nIt's not so much about their ice cream as it is the ATMOSPHERE. You see last time I went I got something to go. It was so unmemorable that I figured I wouldn't even return. I left thinking.. \"What's the big deal about this place?!\" If there were a status category for me it'd be sugartarian because everything I eat has to pretty much be consumed of sugar. So, as you can guess, I'm a bit picky with my sweets.. Ok, not really but sort of. \n\nThis last time I walked in and that sweet ice cream parlor smell hit me in the face. It was like I transformed into Pepe' Le Pew and my body lifted in the air and swam mid air over to the counter. My friend saw this and told me to sit down before I swam into that beautiful Tiffany Lamp hanging from the ceiling. So I came back earth bound and we strutted over to a cute little table. \n\nOur Waitress was super nice and patient as I changed just about everything from my banana split concoction. As we sat there I was taken back into a simpler time, where people used to come and enjoy the ice cream and phosphates of yesteryear without so much as a care in the world while they did so. Fast Food didn't cross my mind, the pile of bills laying on a table at home were left there for a minute and the only thing I cared about was the conversation of a good friend and the smell of that beautiful ice cream parlor. \n\nOur server came over quickly with our treats, and they were in silver dishes! The kid inside took over and I began furiously shoving ice cream into my mouth hole. It was delicious and made just right. It was like an elaborate treat just for me brought out in this special dish. I was all smiles and even tilted the silver cup up to my mouth to drink every last drop of ice cream possible. \n\nI sat there starry eyed with a full tummy talking to my friend, and it hit me then that the atmosphere is exactly why this place is so great. Cold Stone is great for their flavors and what they offer, but they don't offer the personal touches and ,forget all your troubles, environment that this place does. I will go back, and enjoy a step back in time very soon. :)",

Great for a date or to take your parents or anyone.

      "text": "Where else can you get table service for ice cream? \n\nThis place is a charming throwback to ice cream parlors of yesteryear with the round, marble-topped tables, pressed tin ceiling, and charming silver ice cream goblets. \n\nTry the seasonal flavors--especially peach during the summer--and you won't be disappointed. I can't recommend the mint chocolate chip ice cream though, usually my favorite, because of a strong, artificial mint taste. \n\nPricing is comparable to Graeters, so a bit high, but at least here you feel like you got your money's worth with ambiance and wait service. It does bring up an interesting quandary though--to tip or not to to tip? It feels tacky to just leave change for a 20% tip on a $3 dish of ice cream, but felt worse not to leave anything at all (so I just left a dollar).\n\nNote: while this is 1 of only 2 locations (the other one is in Montgomery Square), they also serve Aglamesis Brothers ice cream at Iris Book Cafe downtown on Main St.",

Not to mention that they actually have table service, and serve your ice cream in metal bowls with little stems.

But the flavors cannot compare. I challenge all you readers to buy THREE PINTS EACH...of Graeters and Aglamesis....of these flavors and compare yourself (I am writing this on October 28th, 2009 so I am giving you seasonal flavors, perhaps)... pumpkin, butter pecan (NOT a seasonal) and Egg Nog.

Big mistake! The young gal behind the counter sure seemed to know what I ordered but upon it's arrival I was repulsed at how awful this concoction tasted. Maybe it was the look on my face but she offered to tweak the drink by pouring out some percentage of the drink and adding soda water to it. Still awful...at least she tried. She then told me the ratios are hard to get right. Hummm. I thought these drinks would be made by actually following a specific recipe. My daughter ordered a phosphate as well while my husband ordered a chocolate malt, delicious! We literally threw the phosphates into the outdoor trash can as they were inedible.

I was the only one who had been to Aglamesis Brothers before so we planned on heading to the Oakley store after a few games of laser tag. I knew the vintage ice cream parlor chairs, authentic soda fountain, and sodas on the menu would appeal to their interests. My family is a huge fan of Graeter's so it's hard to pull them away even one time from their favorites, but I promised them it was worth the deviation. All enjoyed the visit; some said \"I still like Graeter's better\" but acknowledged they enjoyed the option for seating at the counter and table service as a change of pace; Aglamesis is nice to mix things up, but there's no competing when it comes to ice cream flavor. Others said they'd prefer Aglamesis in the future because of the options for shakes and sundaes. But, all agreed it was nice to see some variety on the menu, especially the sodas and phosphates.\n\nI had the red raspberry soda (soda, french vanilla ice cream, raspberry syrup) and loved it.",

The old-timey atmosphere is fun without being too cutesy. The location is different without being too suburban. The service is attentive but not invasive. Basically, Aglamesis is the Goldilocks of the Cincinnati ice cream scene - just right. Try the pink champagne shaved ice.",

I've been meaning to check this place out for a while now and I'm glad it finally happened!\n\nI'm not up for straight up scoops of cookie dough, but what my friend suggested, the flurry, sounded perfect for me! So I built my own! I wanted to try their seasonal Oreo cheesecake cookie batter, but apparently they were out. So my second choice was birthday cookies. The woman working there said she liked them slightly better than the regular sugar cookies because it was the same recipe but the birthday cookies had actual cake mix in it. Sounds Yum! Anyway, so I got a flurry with birthday cookies, Reese's cups and peanut butter sauce with swirl ice cream. It was delicious! I would happily return to make another of the exact same thing.\n\nJust a heads up that the flurries only come in one size and it's decently large. It looked to be the perfect size to me. I would happily eat one on my own and not share. Not too small and not too big.",

If you're a peanut butter lover, you'll fall even deeper after you get a peanut butter cookie dough flurry.\n\nI've been here several times and if flurries aren't your style, try a side by side (scoop of cookie dough next to a pile of soft serve) or just a scoop of cookie dough.

Therefore, the two young ladies working were paying no attention and were actually watching Netflix on their phone or tablet. They did not take notice of our presence until I spoke up, at which point they quickly tried to hide the video and act professional. I had never been so I had to ask about some of the menu options and try a few things, which they weren't great at doing. I asked to sample the cake batter cookie dough and she instead brought me the sugar cookie (but I chose not to make a fuss to be polite). \n\nAnyways, our desserts themselves weren't bad, certaintly nothing special though (whipped cream from a can instead of homemade like Graeter's). But while we were eating, I noticed the employees (once again with no customers to serve) sitting with their butts on the counter and feet up as well, right where the food gets prepared. Disgusting! That has to be a health code issue.",

I'm happy there is a place you can eat cookie dough and not have to worry about your mom slapping your hand and saying \"don't eat that, you'll get salmonella.\" I've tried the sugar cookie, chocolate chip, and chocolate chip brownie cookie dough with an equal enjoyment of all three. I loaded up on the chocolate chip to take home and it was a huge success with my wife! You can even get ice cream with your cookie dough and they do a variety of malts, shaved ice, and coffee shop related beverages. \n\nThe staff was pleasant, accommodating, and cheerful. The parlor is smaller but has seating in and out side. The decor is fun and very much what I would expect to see in a ice cream parlor; a giant transformer in the corner, bright colored chairs, giant penny made of real pennies, and a random Elvis Presley clock with live action swinging hips. I look forward to coming back and taste test other items on the menu. Thank you for a great experience!",

If you have a sweet tooth, this place is perfect for you. It's across the street from a brewery so it's in a perfect area to stop at the brewery first then stop at Pendleton for dessert.",

The premise is the combination of soft serve ice cream and cookie dough. That simple but that genius. I had vanilla ice cream side by side with sugar cookie dough and it was amazing. The space is a bit narrow but manages to look open. The decor is interesting and I'm not sure what it's going for but there are some interesting pieces, including an old breathalyzer like my grandpa used to build in his barn. What it was doing in an ice cream parlor, who can say, but it made me smile. Hope to check this place out again. Prices also seemed really reasonable.",

      "text": "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE COOKIE DOUGH AND SOFT SERVE. Whether it be McDonald's, DQ or gourmet soft serve I will eat it and love it. My standards aren't quite high, but to be honest I've never had a bad soft serve experience. \n\nThe atmosphere and service is great--it gives you that old ice cream parlor feel (unfortunately, seating is limited). Their soft serve was creamy and delicious, it met my expectations. They offer either vanilla, chocolate or zebra; zebra is the best option in my opinion, because who doesn't love a chocolate vanilla blend?! I also enjoyed being able to eat my soft serve with my dog who enjoyed his cute little vanilla soft serve cup topped with a bone (you can opt for a whipped cream dog treat as well). YES DOGS CAN COME IN AND EAT WITH YOU!!! \n\nAs for the cookie dough, it was quite interesting in a good way. It paired well with the soft serve and tasted like cookie dough, but the texture was a bit unexpected. The cookie dough had a light airy texture and was not dense or firm like your typical cookie dough bites. However, once you look past that unexpected surprise, the flavor is spot on.  It was salty, sweet and filled with LOTS of chocolate chips. They offer 3 signature cookie dough flavors: original, cake batter, and sugar cookie as well as one rotating flavor, which for March 2019 is SAMOAS!!! So far, I've tried the original and samoas, both tasted great.\n\nTheir most recommended item is the side by side, which comes with a large portion of ice cream (about 3/4) and cookie dough (1/4). When you pair the cookie dough with ice cream it is the absolute perfect combination. Since soft serve is light, having fluffy cookie dough compliments its texture well. Even though it's 5 dollars, the portion is HUGE and shareable between two people. They also offer cookie dough alone, cookie dough flights and a bunch of other items (coffee/espresso combinations, shakes, sundaes, endless toppings, some regular ice cream options and more).\n\nI  plan on coming back with my dog in the future ( it's his new favorite place and has replaced his love for Starbucks puppuccinos)  My one recommendations or request would be to sell small, medium and large side by side options. Though I loved my treat, it was just too much--I couldn't finish it. Right now, the cup size is around a large!!",

The cookie dough is awesome. The best part of making cookies is the dough but you're always told not to eat the dough.

The decor and atmosphere is cute, they had the great British baking show playing on the TVs when we came in so bonus points for that! The staff is nice but not overly helpful and the menu seemed kind of limited. They only have like4 different cookie dough flavors and many of the ice cream flavors were blacked out when we arrived. Like another reviewer mentioned there are no prices listed so we had no idea what we were getting into. We settled on 2 side by sides ( cookie dough and ice cream) and that came to about $13 with a 15% tip. The actual flavors were okay but we could not finish the cookie dough it was weirdly too much and at the same time not enough flavor to make you want to keep eating. \n\nPortion consistency was also an issue here because I had one small scoop of ice cream in my order while my boyfriend had almost half his container filled with ice cream. Not sure what's going on there but we paid the same price for both so they should be even in the amount of product. Probably won't make a special trip to this place but I could see it being convenient for people who live in the neighborhood.",

So I knew when Pendleton Parlor had a flight of edible cookie dough, I was on it! \n\nI think it's pretty close to actual cookie dough. The taste was great, salty and sweet just as you'd expect. The flight is a small sampling of each flavor. I LOVED the original cookie dough, brownie batter and sugar cookie. The cake flavor was just okay. \n\nSizing was just right just an after dinner treat. I ate some, gave some to my mom and kiddo to try and still had a sample leftover for the next day! And it was just as yummy on day 2 from my fridge!\n\nHubby ordered the Java Whip and also really loved it. We've had it before from the Mt. Washington Creamy Whip (same family) so we knew it was a solid choice. \n\nDecor is so cute and kitschy! Loved the small steps up to order and the long bar to stay and eat. Not having any prices listed is a biiiiiig downfall. It seems very sneaky to not list your prices. Our cookie dough flight and Java Whip was $12- so I can only assume $8 and $4 but no clue really. \n\nOverall, I'll for sure be back, especially because they have the perfect spot in Pendleton surrounded by other great businesses.",

If you said \"yes\" to any of these you're entitled to your opinion but you should also probably seek help (unless it's due to a medical circumstance than apologies for poor taste in humor). Anyways, Pendleton Parlor is my go-to for a sweet tooth if I can't decide between pigging out on ice cream and/or cookie dough. I love how I can say \"and/or\" because you can literally have either ice cream and edible cookie dough on their own OR have my personal favorite combination of the two. Regardless, there's plenty of options on either side, plus if you're not feeling either, they have speciality floats/coffees as well as shakes/malts. The shop itself reminds me of, surprise, a modern twist on an old school ice cream parlor. It's definitely a good spot to grab a scoop or two with your family or even a nice little sweet spot as part of a date. Seriously every time this place gets brought up among my friends I immediately crave it, so writing this for you all isn't helping.",

Right across from Chx/3Points on Broadway street, the store is decorated with old, eclectic statues, toys and other items you might find in a museum of pop culture.\n\nOn to the ice cream- I ordered my classic chocolate and peanut butter Sunday with hot fudge. If an ice cream parlor can't do this right...we're done. Fortunately, they nailed it! They smashed the peanut butter into the chelate ice cream and smothered it with hot fudge, whip cream nuts and a cherry. Two YUMS wayyy up!\n\nThe soft serve concept is simple but can be done multiple different ways. The toppings and syrups create a ton of varieties and the nice staff is more than ready to accommodate.\n\nMy daughter ordered an affogato (an ice cream, dough drink concoction). Yes, she let me have a bite. It was a delicious mix of flavors! \n\nSurprisingly, there was a steady steam of customers coming through, even at the late hour. I can't imagine how packed this place will be once the winter thaw arrives. Another GREAT addition to the Pendleton food scene. We'll be regulars.",

They pay homage to the old-fashioned, while providing some upgraded options as well. They will even let you sample some of their egg-less cookie dough to see if you want to kick it up a knotch... And dang, I could eat a bowl of that alone!\n\nI would say the only downside is really the price in comparison to other creamy whip shops within the Cincinnati area.

      "text": "As much as I wanted to like this little location and as much as other Yelpers loved it here, I must admit I was not impressed. This parlor is super cute on the inside and located in Pendleton right across the street from 3 Points Brewery. It's in a good location with a parking lot right next door, so it has easy access. The ambience and decor has the old school vibe with a modern twist. Like a back in the day ice cream parlor but in 2018. Super cute! I loved that. However. When it comes to the actual products it's nothing to brag about. They have soft serve, edible cookie dough, shakes and more. You can get tons of combinations. \n\nI ordered what the worker called a \"side by side\" aka cookie dough with soft serve. It's cookie dough in the bottom with soft serve on the top. I got the \"bigger\" size. I don't know the measurements as far as oz. However, it was 3/4 cookie dough and 1/4 soft serve. We ate the ice cream quicker than the cookie dough. Go figure! We got vanilla soft serve with chocolate chip cookie dough. The soft serve was good. Tastes like typical soft serve to me. It wasn't anything special or to write home about. My husband said it taste like McDonalds. I'm sure that's an insult but it is what it is. Honestly, in my opinion the cookie dough was NASTY. It was weird! It was super airy and fluffy, like whipped. It did not taste like normal cookie dough. You know firm but with a slight softness. I have had different brands of edible cookie dough and they are awesome, and taste just like non-edible cookie dough. This cookie dough just didn't do it for me. It tasted like we were eating cookie flavored fluff with crunch from the chocolate chips. The texture was off for sure. It tasted ok as long as you got a scoop of ice cream with it. It was not tasty by itself. Once we ate all the soft serve we tossed what dough was left. \n\nOverall, I wanted to like this place and was super excited. However, I just wasn't wowed at all! I doubt I'll be back.",

I played it safe and got the chocolate chip cookie dough and a twist for my soft serve which rang up at around $6.\n\nThe two together was DELICIOUS! The cookie dough definitely needed the ice cream with it to make it more moist - without I can see where some reviews say the cookie dough is dry. \n\nThe only downfall to this place is the seating - there is literally only ONE table in the place and then some high top counters that you can sit at. Otherwise there are cool stadium seats, but they aren't really ideal for eating (no table) and are kind of in the walkway of the place and not really in an ideal location. \n\nI need to mention the decorations - the place is kind of eclectic but it fits really well together - there is the transformer, some flags/posters, small statues, etc. that at first you would not think work well together - but here they do!\n\nOverall - definitely recommend visiting - just plan ahead for what you want to do regarding seating/eating!\n\nRatings on the Morgan Scale:\nOverall Experience: 9/10\nFood Price: 7/10\nDrink Price: N/A",

The interior is unique with classic ice cream parlor décor with unique items such as a 10 layer, creation out of pennies. The menu is coffee/expresso heavy and I really wanted to order something like the affogato but it was just too late in the evening for me. Decided on ordering some cookie dough, which was simply that. If I was to visit again, I would order ice cream or at least a ice-cream cookie dough combination.",

I'm a huge fan of all things cookie dough, so I was immediately game when my friend asked if I wanted to join her here.  The staff was friendly, answered all of our questions, and made recommendations.\n\nWe were there close to Halloween and we were digging the decorations at the time.  The parlour has an old school feel to it, and the vintage candy machine in the back was a nice touch.  On the flip side, the gigantic Bumblebee statue was new and yet equally cool.\n\nBecause I couldn't decide what I wanted, I opted for a peanut butter milkshake to enjoy there and cake batter cookie dough with sprinkles for later.  Both were very yummy and I will be back! The only thing that would improve this place for me would be to have a peanut butter cookie dough option! They wouldn't be able to keep me away if they ever add that to the menu!",

They place was very unique, with lots of quirky decorations. They had an interesting Nitro Float on the menu, so I decided to give it a try. It wasn't bad - just ice cream with coffee mixed together. There were only 2 employees working, so the place was just a little messy, but other than that, pretty neat place to check out for ice cream.",

      "text": "My experience at Pendleton has always been good. I've raved about the ice cream to friends and continuously go back. Everything was great until my recent experience. I went in to order my usual (side by side cookies n cream + chocolate chip cookie dough). When I entered, there was one person serving customers and two others talking to each other. One was talking about a bad experience she had with another customer. She mentioned the lady kept explaining the wrong thing which was so frustrating. First....it is so unprofessional to complain about customers in front of other customers (or at all). Second...if there's a line, it's best to stop the conversation and tend to the customers (just my opinion). Once they finished, the same one who was complaining about the previous customer asked what I'd like. She was very pleasant at first I must say. I told her my usual but I said \"half n half of cookies n cream and chocolate chip cookie dough\" instead of side by side. When she gave me a baby scoop (half of one scoop) I explained that this wasn't exactly the size I'm used to. She thought I meant a half scoop total. So we laughed about the mistake and she brought it back. This time she gave me a full scoop, but half of two different cookie doughs. I explained again that this wasn't what I ordered and mentioned one scoop of cookie dough, one scoop of ice cream. This time she gave me two full scoops of cookie dough and explained she thought I meant one scoop of cookie dough ice cream and one scoop of cheesecake Oreo cookie dough. Never said Oreo. Never said cheesecake. Their menu also clearly says cookies n cream under ice cream and nowhere else. She was visibly frustrated so I explained again. This time she brought me a scoop of cookies n cream ice cream and a scoop of cheesecake Oreo cookie dough. Sigh. Remember when I said I never said cheesecake? Never said Oreo? Yep, here it was again. She then says, you wanted cookies n cream ice cream and chocolate chip cookie dough right? I said yes, but this is cookies n cream and Oreo cheesecake cookie dough isn't it? She said yes it is...since I already put the chocolate chip cookie dough in the wrong order before you can just take them both. At this point I just said thanks and left. If you know I didn't order Oreo cheesecake cookie dough why would you put it in the cup again? Even though the order took a long time to make, I was most frustrated with knowing that as soon as I left, I'm sure she was going to complain about me too. However, based on my interaction with her, I can understand why the other customer also had a hard time communicating. I love this ice cream but these experiences are what make me go somewhere else.",

      "text": "Decided to go here after brunch at Boomtown. We were misinformed believing this was a venture of one the new spots like in the area like Q, Boom, or something else. But the two women present stated otherwise. This is the third location of this Milford creamery. They're known for their cookie dough. I love me some cookie dough but always get nervous whether or not this is the batch where I get salmonella. The choices are infinite on what you can get for flavors, sauces, servers, toppings, and more. What's also unique is that they serve an inkling of coffee infused ice cream. They're laying their ground toward Buzzed Bull for uniquely infused ice cream. With all the options the workers were helpful in what combos would work.  In the end I got the vanilla flurry soft serve with brownie cookie dough and nutella. It was a great mixture. Since my initial butter pecan choice had them confused if I was Benjamin Button for only old people like that...harsh. With the portion sizes I'd say the price is fair. You can't go wrong with sweets and ice cream. The Parlor is far from any mishaps. The inside was nicely designed and with an open feel to it. They had lots of old relics that reminds one of an ice cream parlor in the 50s with interesting relics they clearly got at an antique sale. For sure will be back.",

She ordered that with chocolate chip cookie dough and I ordered a side by side with vanilla ice cream and chocolate chip cookie dough. To say the least, we were both stunned. The edible cookie dough tastes just like regular cookie dough you'd buy from the grocery store! The ice cream was creamed and whipped to perfection. This place will for sure become one of our favorite stops!\n\nSide note: We went to buy water bottles and the staff person was so kind as to just get us free cups of ice water. Very happy with our visit here!",

No one offered us help- we had to speak up and ask for the menu to be explained. Which the worker half way explained.. For the price- I'd rather have graters. They also have no seating area. When we sat in the old stadium seats- I felt like we where eyeballing the staff, and felt like they didn't like us there, and they could talk among them self's comfortably with us sitting there. \n\nThe soft serve was no better than McDonald's- and a large ice cream is not much larger than a McDonald's cone. \n\nMuch rather go to a place where the prices are clear and we can seat comfortably. \n\nIt seems like a lot of locals will give a business a 5 star- just because they are local. That's all I can figure with this location. I don't imagine this place being here for a long time- nor will I be back.",

Then we ordered. \nWe got a small cup of cookie dough and cake batter and it was really great. I highly recommend the cake batter. It was probably our favorite. We asked them if it is the same as normal cookie dough with raw egg and they said that their eggs are pasteurized. Although it was very good, it's very filling. Our party of 4 could easily split two small cups of cookie dough. \n\nThey also sell shakes and other cookie dough sundae-type desserts. We haven't tried them but are planning to come back in the future. \n\nThe parlor itself is very old fashioned and it's really fun to look around. It's 70's themed and a pretty great atmosphere.

      "text": "Will not receive my business EVER again! I've been here plenty of times prior to my visit this evening and everything was great. Unfortunately, I just went in and saw some students from my school (the local neighborhood school) asking for water. At first the man told them no he couldn't fill their cup, but then decided to do so anyways. I was near the end of the line, as the students were leaving they saw me and told me which teachers they had next year. I then asked if they wanted any ice cream. When we went to order, I was asked if I was their parent or legal guardian because it's a liability for someone else to buy them ice cream. Excuse me? That's a first I've ever been asked that in order to buy ice cream. I stated that they attend the school I teach at and he said since I \"know them he would let me buy it for them\". At that point, I realized what was happening. \n\nAfter I made the purchase and we left, I decided to call and speak with the owner. The person I spoke to explained to me that the reason the person handled the situation is how their boss told them to. She went on the explain when the neighborhood kids come in and don't make a purchase they typically steal the tip jars. In which I responded saying \"those exact kids that were in there with me?\" And she said no just neighborhood kids. Which left me a little dumbfounded because that wasn't even what I was speaking to... but she unknowingly confirmed my suspicions. My guess is if the kids looked liked me, he would have never asked such a question. I called because I wanted to know why I was asked if I was their parent/guardian....I asked to speak to the owner and she gave me his phone number, which when I called went directly to voicemail--with a full inbox.  The entire situation has caused me to believe that this company needs to realize the neighborhood in which they operate in, and see people as people and maybe, just maybe, don't be racist. I don't think that's too much to ask.",

However the friend that I had gone out with was very excited to try the butterscotch flavor but was told that they do not have an actual butterscotch flavor instead they just mix in vanilla icecream+caramel topping. Their list of flavors was also quite commonplace that you could pretty much get in other icecream parlors. Their interiors was pretty chić and they had a vintage themed decor which I absolutely loved. They also have edible cookie dough which I did not have a chance to try this time; coming back for that soon !!",

There are first off no prices listed anywhere, so until you get ready to pay do you know the damage you've inflicted on your bank account for what I would call mediocre ice cream at best. We ordered 2 side-by-sides (cookie dough and ice cream together in a cup) and it was $10.50. Then, because it was a hot night, I'd had a few, and needed a little pick-me-up I ordered an iced coffee. The total was now $14.50....excuse me what?! $4 for basic, black, only so-so iced coffee? Being from Chicago where prices are generally high, this is ridiculous. Next - customer service, or rather lack thereof. Again, I'm not a Cincy native so I don't know how your freaking menu works, so perhaps offer a brief explanation to make the ordering process easier and more efficient for the line of folks behind us. Instead a curt \"I can take your order...\" with all of the enthusiasm of a lifeless fish was all we were greeted with. And just a suggestion, chill your cookie dough. It's far more appealing, better textured, and less likely to melt your ice cream rapidly on an already hot night in a rather warm establishment, than the room temperature cookie dough squish I was served. Also, if you close at 11, don't start visibly and loudly closing up shop at 9:45...and also, if you've worked a 10 hour shift, I get it you could be a little frustrated, but don't complain about it in front of your customers. As for a blatant health code violation, at least where I'm from in Illinois and now in Kentucky, maybe don't your garbage out through the main dining room and front door while you've got at least 8 patrons in there. Y'all have a back door to the alleyway behind your building to your dumpster for a reason. Also, when you get back in from taking out the trash, wash your freaking hands before taking someone's order. Have staff that seem to give a shit about their jobs and aren't so preoccupied by trying to close early, playing inappropriate shows on Netflix (I don't personally care about shows rated TV-MA, but it's a family establishment  let's keep it that way), and being generally surly to paying customers who were looking to a nice end to their evening only to have it patently deflated by what I can only describe as truly abominable customer \"service\". For my money, I'd have gone to DQ and been happier. This definitely will NOT be a place I come back to next time in the area unless so major changes happen. Peace out Pendleton's, see ya never.",

I love they make things from scratch and you can see how they work on all the goodies right there in the store. HOWEVER, I saw one of the workers stick her finger (without gloves) in the cookie dough she was making to test it, LICK her finger, and stick her hand again in the dough after adjusting some of the ingredients. Absolutely unacceptable, unsafe, unhygienic and just gross.  She should not be touching the dough without gloves and licking her hands while working with food. The owner should seriously talk to the employees about this serious issue to ensure the safety of the food they sell. As much as I loved the ice-cream, I will not be coming back due to food safety concerns.",

They have special flavors but they add toppings to the vanilla or chocolate ice cream to make it that way. So is it a natural home made flavor.. NOPE. The ice cream did not taste better than ikea's soft serve or McDonald's. Their gimmick is their cookie though. The cookie dough tasted like flour, and it was super salty. What a disappointment. You can't find a single price anywhere in the store so their employees are excellent at up-selling every single item and they give it to you super quick so when it's time to pay you can't say anything but give them all of your money !  I will not be back. I prefer to give my money to Schneider's in ky! That's true home made ice cream!",

      "text": "For anyone living in this are of OTR and has a sweet tooth or addiction to chocolate, this is your go to place. While waiting on my order I looked around at all the vintage style accessories, some very unique and you don't see around a lot. The one that caught my attention was the old metal divers helmet. I don't know if that would be categorized as vintage but is definitely unusual and not seen often. The parlor is not a place to sit and enjoy your treat unless it is not at peak hours. The space is not large enough to have much in the way of seating. If you go at a time when they be fairly busy and folks are sitting there is little space in which to navigate when placing your order and waiting for it to be prepared. Yesterday, mid-afternoon would be considered peak time. All seating taken, we weren't planning on staying; however the line waiting to order was okay but once you order, pay and wait for it you should use common sense and take a place in a different line, if you will so as not to block those coming to the counter to order. If the couple who ordered following me would have taken their place BEHIND me and not stay planted in front of us waiting for our order there wouldn't have been the bottleneck at the counter. This is what I mean about common sense.  This in no way reflects on The Parlor. The choices of ice creams, sorbet, shakes/malts are plentiful. Different ways to have your indulgence such as cone, cone in a dish, etc. The prices are in line with other ice cream shops for the size and what you order. The young ladies working yesterday were on the move, steady pace to get everyone served with minimal wait. The Parlor is immaculate! Since chocolate is my primary addiction I ordered a chocolate malt. It was amazing! Took me mentally to my childhood. My grandmother, who lived on Madison Road, would walk us to Aglamesis for a treat. The Parlor will be on my list of places to revisit!",

      "text": "After reading all of the rave reviews,  I decided to check for myself to see what all of the hype was about. Let me tell you, I am so glad that I did. I wanted my first go at Milk Jar to be something standard, so they recommended the Black Ceylon Tea. While waiting, I read that co-owner Jimmy Lin is from Fujian, which is considered the tea capital of China. He imports the tea straight from China, so you know what you're getting is top-quality. \n\nWhile I was here,I was also intrigued by the \"milk cap\" that was available as an add-on. I read elsewhere that the milk cap is a new trend that has been dubbed the Chinese cappuccino. On their menu, they describe their milk cap as a salty, soft foam - not unlike what you'd find at the frothy top layer of a cappuccino. However, I knew immediately upon taking my first taste that it was a little different than something you'd find at a run-of-the-mill cafe. The milk cap had a foam-like texture, but it also contained a thick enough consistency to be considered something chewable. The end result was something I could only describe as heavenly. The flavor was reminiscent of something sweet, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was. After a few more sips, I determined that it was similar to cheesecake. Their menu listed the milk cap as made up of cream cheese and pink salt, so the cheesecake comparison made sense. \n\nOther options on their extensive menu include items such as rolled ice cream and various sugary breakfast cereals. If you have a sweet tooth, I would definitely make a point to swing by a try Milk Jar for yourself!",

I liked the tea itself but the bubbles were not as soft in my opinion. *disclaimer* i am spoiled by NY/Queens bbtea places like xin fu tang and tiger sugar with superrr soft squishy bubbles. Otherwise it was good and i want to come and try different flavors.

They have unique flavors of milk tea and they have a custard pudding that they put inside the tea that is delicious! Custard in your milk tea sounds weird but it goes so great together! They have an option to make your drink \"dirty\" which just means they use brown sugar instead of caramel. I have tried the dirty mango, dirty taro, Thai milk tea, mango matcha latte, the caramel mango pudding, and the dirty egg milk tea. I keep buying 2 at a time because they are so good. You can also chose your sweetness level. Make sure you stir up the drink when you get it otherwise you will take a big gulp of all the sweet syrup and flavors at the bottom. I also think the teas look cool with the ombré effect of the milk on top with all the flavors at the bottom (insta worthy).\n\nI highly recommend coming here for a snack or afternoon pick me up. I stop by whenever I'm in the area. They also have regular teas, and rolled ice cream that I am looking forward to trying next.",

I was sad that I didn't get to check out the interior, but immediately impressed with their covid protocol. \n\nEverything is contactless, even payment which made me feel very safe. \n\nI got a regular Mango Oolong tea and it was a little too sweet for me so I'll get less sugar next time! The lychee jellies were a good consistency and I could tell they used actual mangoes from the mango chunks in my tea. You do have to shake v well to get a uniform consistency, but it was very tasty.\n\nI plan to come visit again when I'm craving boba!",

      "text": "I'm so glad to see that there are bubble tea shops around Cincinnati! Milk Jar seemed the most unique to the city with a very high rating, so I decided to stop by during my short trip. I went right when it opened in the morning on a weekday, so it was empty. The cashier was very helpful with the menu, and the drinks were made so fast!\n\nI love how customizable every drink was on the menu, but it definitely made it harder for me to choose. I went with a mango oolong tea under recommendation and a dirty egg milk tea out of curiosity. To preface, both drinks were extremely sweet, and I'd order them again with less sugar.\n\nThe mango oolong tea was tasty, but it was like a sugar bomb with the lychee jelly. I had to drink lots of water in between. I enjoyed it though, and it tasted like fresh mangos. The dirty egg milk tea was basically a brown sugar milk tea with egg custard topping, hence \"dirty egg.\" I really liked this tea, and I'm a huge fan of egg custard.\n\nI can see why Milk Jar has such a high rating, and I could see that the menu was created with a lot of care. I'm excited to visit again when I'm back and maybe try some of the other desserts as well!",

      "text": "I have been to Milk Jar Cafe twice this past week, and both times have been amazing! They have some outdoor seating and are not seating indoors currently due to COVID (they have been following the guidelines great with masks and contactless payments). Just know that they don't accept card under $10 (but you can use venmo or cash). I got the oolong milk tea and Ceylon black milk tea, and both were great. Their only milk substitute is Almond milk, which is my favorite non-dairy milk (hello lactose intolerance). Their tapioca boba is bouncy with a nice brown sugar flavor, and their tea was great quality as well! Because the cups are very sturdy, they offer a discount when you bring back in your cup and lid to reuse. This is my go to boba place here in Cincinnati :)",

      "text": "Perfect bubble tea.  Tapioca pearls that are cooked appropriately, not mushy or too hard.  There are varying degrees of sweetness that you can choose when you're ordering that even shows up on your receipt so you know they paid attention to it.  And they don't replace it with artificial sweetener so you don't have to worry about any aftertaste.  It's just pure sugar adjustment which should be an option for everything in this world to be honest.  The tea is good, the milk is good.  I wouldn't choose the less ice option unless it's cold outside.  The ice is the only thing that will properly chill your drink so if you ask for half or no ice, your drink will be running water - lukewarm temperature.  The strawberry matcha tea is wonderful with real fruit that provides a subtle hint that works great with the matcha tea and milk.  I think that strawberry popping bubbles in place of tapioca will make a drink sweeter because my fiancee got that with the same 50% sweetness and hers was way sweeter than mine.  Sturdy plastic cups too.  Make sure to recycle them!  Because they're definitely not going anywhere for a while.  The drinks are not as cheap as Houston prices, but that's asking for too much.\n\nTheir website is a bit of a mess but their Doordash is well laid out.  I would definitely come back.",

Maybe I'm just not a fan of rolled ice cream, but it's quite expensive and weirdly flavorless. This sounds ridiculous, but the rolling process almost requires it to be *too* cold (á la Dippin Dots). In the end it's more about the presentation value than the taste... which is fun for the first picture and thereafter suffers from diminishing returns. \n\nNot sure why their Boba containers need to be made of ballistic-grade /un-recyclable plastic (my inner Captain Planet screams out at this injustice)... just seems a bit wasteful. MJ's a solid choice if already in the area but in general prefer \"normal\" ice cream.",

I also had the option to add additional toppings, but I decided to just try it on its own. We were able to watch my ice cream being made and delicately positioned in the serving bowl. Unfortunately, the server ran out of room and had to squash in the final ice cream roll, which ruined the aesthetic lol. \n\nMy husband went with the Strawberry Matcha Latte, and he was pleased with this unique drink. \n\nMilk Jar has a really unique, fun menu, and I can't wait to try more items featured on it!",

The guys put your ingredients on this frozen table then chop it, mix it, smear it then roll it up into little tubes. \nMy brother-in-law loves the Unicorn Poop. Which is ice cream base with caramel sauce and Fruity Pebbles. I have to agree. It's pretty darn good. Normally I'm pretty simple. I just go with ice cream base, bananas mixed in then topped with pineapple and cherries.

The entire take-out procedure is simple, efficient, and relies somewhat on an honor system. Interested patrons can call ahead and place their orders; once your drinks and snacks have been prepared, an employee will set them on a table outside the shop, alongside information on how to pay through cash apps such as Venmo. \n\nMy service here every time has been wonderful.

      "text": "So if you deliver milk every day, use a MILK CAR\nAnd if you serve adult milk drinks, you have a MILK BAR\nDon't joke about Barbie's job, that's taking it too MILK FAR\nAnd if you want Boba come and try the drinks at MILK JAR\n\nI think back to my childhood, and thank you for your MILK, MA\nEven though I walked in on your HJ, trying to MILK PA\nI do so many money shots, I'm not a pornstar, I'm a MILK STAR\nBut if you want some Bubble Tea, try the drinks at MILK JAR\n\nWHAT\n\nI have lots of great things to say about Milk Jar. They're trying to do a lot of things at once like rolled ice cream and snow ice and whatever but I came here definitively for the fresh homemade bubble tea.\n\nThey have different options to others in Cinci, and it's quite an original menu. It's definitely advanced for the Cincinnati area. That makes three pretty good bubble tea shops they have in these parts, and this is the only one that is out in the suburbs, and probably the most authentic and imaginative.\n\nThe girl serving was a total angel and was flirting with me. The guys were really cool. I was teasing them for getting a different customer confused with another customer. They took it well. Good sports.\n\nSpeaking of Good Sports don't talk to Cincinnati natives about their sports teams.\n\nAnyway I appreciate the innovative and authentic and fresh Bubble Tea menu. I also really really appreciate how they make their stuff. Everything is real and natural and fresh, for example the strawberry tea features a bunch of strawberries blended up and mixed on the spot, with some tea. You really don't see that a lot and they're doing it extremely well. Talk about the real deal. Guy Fieri can go f*** himself.\n\nThere's always a problem though - and in this case the problem is the tapioca. Listen, when you are charging a pretty hefty amount for your bubble tea - especially by Cincinnati standards - and when you are doing such a perfect job with everything else like the fresh fruit in the fruit teas and the wonderful tasting milk teas, then you really need to get the boba right. Its not the taste, because it's very sweet delicious honey boba and could even be some of the best I've had based on taste alone. But they real problem is the texture. It's nightmarish.\n\nI don't know if it was a one-off and I really hope it was, but even if it was a one-off, that shouldn't happen. If your Boba is so hard that it's going to break my teeth and be spat right out the window onto Interstate 71 at 85mph unless you're a cop in which case I promise I was doing 55 officer, then you shouldn't be serving it.\n\nLiterally I had to try to avoid getting boba in my straw for both of my drinks - which were both excellent drinks.\n\nWhen I did get boba in my straw, which happened several times, I had to avoid trying to chew it because it was hurting my teeth because it was so hard and tough and rubbery. And I never have that problem and I try dozens of boba places a week. Sure, squidgy boba gets old, soggy boba sucks, but hard boba that hurts teeth? That's the biggest no no of all.\n\nThe taste of it was nice but the consistency was awful and I have no idea what they did with it - perhaps left it laying around a long time or just didn't do it right. So down came the window at 85 I mean 55 miles an hour and my spitting talents were put to the most severe test as I fired four and five Boba at a time out of the window trying to make sure they didn't land in the car.\n\nAnd they didn't, if Avis asks.\n\nSo if you were driving on I-71 north outside Cincinnati on that day and you found some hard pieces of tapioca on your tires after your drive then I apologize, if they hit your windshield, I apologize for the broken glass (they were that hard), but you should also call this shop and ask them to apologize as well because I'm not the one who made the Boba inedible.\n\nFive stars for the drinks and service. One star for the tapiok. It was anything but OK.\n\nSo if you got drunk in a bar\nAnd your beer addiction's gone too far\nThere's an alternate option\nTo getting your hops on\nCome get some Boba at Milk Jar!",

      "text": "Move over local tea competitors, Milk Jar Cafe is killing the tastebuds right now with a sweet, creamy, and refreshing take on milk teas! \n\nI don't live in the area but I was taken here by my boyfriend and can we please get one in Louisville?? I have tried a handful of milk tea's all over the world and Milk Jar has brought me to life. The milk tea is creamy and refreshing at the same time... how is that possible?! \n\nI am not a boba girl myself because I am currently using Invisalign and didn't want to risk getting it stuck so I opted for the grass jelly and oh my, 100% recommend! \n\nIf you are in the area and craving milk tea, fruit tea, or rolled ice cream this is the place visit. I will be coming back here!! \n\nSide note... I love that the have a heart stopper on every cap and the cups are hard and durable, great cups and great service. \n\nAs a first timer here they were very patient and helpful, a hello and a smile and a goodbye with a wave! \n\nWith some of the drinks (strawberry matcha) you have to stir until it's all one color a little of a workout but it stirs quickly.",

Sort of a twist on Cold Stone.\nEverything is *very* sweet -- for me, this is definitely a place for an occasional sweet treat, not a regular stop. The prices are maybe a teensy bit high -- my partner and I got two ice creams and two teas between us, and paid over $25.\nThe staff did not seem to be knowledgeable about dietary restrictions -- when my partner asked about gluten-free options, one worker said that nothing was gluten-free because they use heavy cream. (Maybe confused with fat free or sugar free?)\nThere is a bit of seating inside, but the space echoes and can get loud quickly.\nIt's a neat place, and probably does well in a wealthier trendy neighborhood like Hyde Park.",

You order through phone or one of the food delivery apps and pay through those or Venmo as well! Contactless process! I got the caramel pudding with milk and boba and it was so good! The boba was very fresh and chewy. My sister got the oolong milk tea with grass jelly which was great as well! The best thing was that they were not overly sweetened! I have to go again and try more flavors! I hope they add lychee jelly to their toppings soon!",

I'm in love. \n\nStopped in and needed a quick lesson on milk tea, milk cap and boba. The two working gave me some great info and I was super excited to try the milk tea. I ordered with milk cap, a delicious creamy, salty, sweet cap and chewy tapioca boba. The drink deserves 10 stars, it tasted amazing. \n\nThe cups are reusable with 5% off if you reuse it. I love the cup concept with a place to drink straight from the cup to mix the cap + tea or a wide straw to drink up the boba. I loved this drink and was actually a little sad when it was gone. I could've drank two of these! \n\nLooking forward to bringing my kiddo for a cereal bowl or rolled ice cream. I'm not really sure why this place isn't heavily marketed, I never really heard of it before Yelp. It's now easily my top 2 fav stop for sweet treats!",

The teas are amazing, and the options they offer are surprisingly extensive for a boba place that focuses on freshness and quality of its ingredients. These guys definitely know what good boba is, and having a conversation with the staff makes the experience more memorable. If you do go a couple of times, they will try to get to know you. As a Californian who is coming from the boba capital of the nation, Milk Jar is definitely one of the best places in the area for boba, and dare I say, might actually be able to compete with some places in the Bay Area.   \n\nAs for drinks I've tried, get one of the milk cap drinks, and their mango/strawberry matcha latte drinks can actually compare to Boba Guys from the West Coast. (For those of you who are also familiar with Boba Guys) In fact, I think I'm just gonna call Milk Jar the Boba Guys of Ohio!",

The matcha latte with a milk cap is a must try! \n\nThe milk cap is a pseudo cheese and heavy cream foam that adds a delicious unique flavor and texture to each sip. \n\nIf you want a milk cap, but want to reduce the amount of calories you're consuming you can ask them to make the matcha latte with almond milk and then add the milk cap on top or not have it all! They also allow you to control your sugar levels and toppings.\n\nIf you do go, I still do not recommend ordering the boba. Though they were better this time, they are still a bit too hard for my taste. \n\nEverything else is fresh and preservative free.

The rolled ice cream is one size and its $7.00. I thought this was a little high of what would equate to 1.5 or 2 scoops of ice cream from another ice cream parlor. The tea for the size I got was like $3.50 or $4.00. \n\nI got the Cookie Monster with a toasted marshmallow on the top to share with my husband and daughter. We choose the vanilla base. It was one Oreo crushed up into our ice cream. I personally prefer more and chunks but it was nice to experience the rolled ice cream. I guess I could have asked for more once rolled on top. They also didn't toast my marshmallow enough. It wasn't gooey. Ice cream with gooey marshmallow is everything.\n\nI only took a few bites of ice cream and then ordered a Thai Milk Tea with Boba.

If you're in Cincinnati and want a delicious treat or are looking to try something out of the ordinary (for the Midwest at least...) you have to stop by Milk Bar Cafe!\n\nAs someone born and raised in the Midwest, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not an expert in bubble tea. I would however consider myself an expert in seeking out delicious food and WOW did Milk Bar exceed my expectation. The shop itself is small, sleek, and clean. The menu is displayed on a huge chalk board wall, which is nice because you can read it and start deciding what you want while you're waiting in line. The staff is friendly and seemed happy to give guidance for those who weren't sure what they wanted. If I lived in the area, I could totally see myself stopping in with my laptop t grab some delicious bubble tea and get some work done. \n\nI had the strawberry matcha bubble tea with tapioca bubbles and it was INSANE! My mind was blown because, how can something be so flavorful and delicious?! Seriously. It was certainly sweet, but not overpowering so. The strawberry flavor was there, but it also let the matcha shine. And, even though I'm no tapioca bubble expert, they were the perfect texture for me because they didn't melt or get too gooey as I sipped on it throughout my long drive home (even though I had to exercise some serious self control not to slurp the entire thing down in a few minutes). If you're not sure what to get, I would absolutely recommend the strawberry match bubble tea. \n\nI'll definitely be stopping back in Milk Bar Cafe as soon as possible. You should too!",

We got a milk cap Thai tea with boba and a strawberry matcha tea with boba. \nI'd heard about milk caps before and they totally lived up to the hype- it's like a little touch of foamy cheesecake on top! They showed me how to drink it correctly, which I appreciated! I saw some complaints in the reviews about the boba texture being wrong, but ours was just right! Soft and a little chewy. The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because the bathroom was really really filthy. The front of house was super clean and tidy so that was surprising, but it was honestly really gross in there. Still, we will definitely go back for the tea!",

I also loved the fact that I could watch them roll my ice cream which added to the experience! They have lots of toppings you can add to your ice cream, but I opted to just have the regular mind chocolate ice cream! \n\nSo glad I found this place and will for sure be back to enjoy throughout the summer! And the guys working there were really nice and helped my friend and I with our decisions which is always appreciated!\n\nFinally they have a punch card so eventually you can enjoy a treat for free!\n\nUnfortunately I only took videos so I can't share them but trust me when I say it looks good and tastes good :)",

Cheese and tea may sound gross but think more like sweet cream cheese and it's delicious. You have to be sure to drink it at the right angle though so that all of the flavors meld together. The guys who work here are friendly and in my last visit they let me sample some of the more exotic flavors of boba and jelly that I was less familiar with.

Being from California...I know my boba lol Not only does this place do boba, but it also does rolled ice cream, cereal, and just added some type of pudding (still need to try).\n\nI have enjoyed coming here not only for the treats, but also the customer service. They always greet you, take the time to speak with you, go over the menu...just gives you a mom and pop feel.\n\nThey have tons of options of everything: ice cream, toppings, boba, and tea flavors. Something that is new to me is the milk cap. My go-to drink is the strawberry/match tea combo with the milk cap. It is like a little piece of heaven has fallen onto your tea. The milk cap has a dense, rich cheesecake flavor.\n\nI recently switched over to the jasmine tea with the jasmine milk cap and still super tasty. It adds a bit of sweetness without being overpowering.\n\nOne of the bummer's of this place is the pricey-ness of it. If you bring your reusable cups back they only give you 5% off your next drink. I appreciate the thoughtfulness, but still, you will typically walk out of this place for nothing less than $8 bucks a person.\n\nFor me...it is still worth it!!

I happened to wander in opening week and the staff was super nice and helpful, and best of all, of course, the quality of the drinks they produce IS ON POINT. So good. You can really taste the tea flavor. There aren't many options around Cincy but the ones I have tried just sort of taste like melted milkshakes. This place obviously pays attention to quality and is passionate about their craft. The tea is not too strong, not too sweet, and balances with the milk perfectly. The boba are the perfect texture, which is also a rare find even in areas with more milk tea shops. \nTrust me, as a San Jose native and someone who is so in love with boba milk tea that they resorted to making their own at home (harder than it sounds)... this place is an absolute gem. \nI nearly wept with happiness when I tasted their oolong milk tea with boba. \n\nThe ice cream is also great. haha. \n\nThe o n l y thing that I would want to see added to the menu are crystal boba. I loved getting those with fruity teas back home. \n\nI'm so endlessly impressed with these good good folks that I'm definitely gonna be a regular.",

      "text": "So excited to finally stop into Milkbar! The name itself totally draws me in.\n\nI went in on a Wednesday night around 8pm. There were a couple families there together and us. Shortly after we got our order though the line grew to probably 12ish people.\n\nThe menu is huge! When an employee asked if we had been there before and we said no he happily came around to our side of the counter to walk us through the options.\n\nThe main choices on their menu are ice cream, milk, or cereal. Each are available with different mix-ins and (ice cream and cereal only) unlimited toppings.\n\nThe cereal mixes didn't really appeal to me, but I really wanted to try just about every ice cream and milk tea available. Like any good ice cream place, they have a variety of fruity, chocolatey, minty, caramel, etc options. I decided to hold off on the milk until next time and get an ice cream. I could decided between the campfire (s'mores style) or the mango madness so I had the cashier choose for me. Mango madness it was.\n\nMy freshly made, ROLLED ice cream was ready in just a few minutes. I asked for a vanilla wafers, strawberry, and just a few mango bobas to top it off.\n\nThis was my first experience with rolled ice cream and it was great! It was very fresh and creamy with the perfect amount of small mango bits worked in. I really liked the texture. It was light but still feel indulgent, like a real treat. I also am now a huge fan of mango popping bobas, as in the past I've been afraid to try it because I knew I didn't like traditional boba.\n\nThis place is definitely pricey at over $14 for my husband and I together. We don't get out much anymore though, so I was happy to treat myself this particular night. I imagine we'll be back to try a milk or the campfire ice cream soon!",

I needed pick-me-up and realized that this place just opened. \n\nMilk Bar is nestled on the less visited side of HP Plaza near Shaan's. It's bright and modern inside. A woman was painting on canvas at a table for what I think will be really cute wall decor. The staff was super enthusiastic when I walked in and excitedly told me about what all Milk Bar offers. There's not only boba drinks but rolled ice cream (with all the fix-in's your heart desires/that fits in the cup) and make-your-own cereal bowls. \n\nWhat I was after however was a refreshing drink - which is was how I was introduced to the milk cap tea....basically tea with a layer of milk thats salty but also sweet... \n\nDoes it sound a little weird? \n\nYa.\n\nIs it delicious? \n\nAbsolutely. \n\nWhat's it like? \n\nI had the Jasmine Tea Milk Cap with boba pearls. You could sip the tea with the long straw and get the deliciously floral tea. Or sip from the top and taste the milk cap which tastes like mild salted caramel cheesecake. It's a unique blend but you will not regret it. \n\nIf you're not sold yet, they try to be green! Their cups are re-usable and are relatively sturdy!",

Though Milk Jar is on the pricier side, it couldn't be more worth it for the incredible flavor and experience you get with each of their teas. I have been following Milk Jar on Instagram for quite some time and finally made it over that way to try it out for myself. I got a Thai milk tea with boba and a milk cap. It was heavenly. Like emotionally good. I had never had a milk cap before, but heard it was similar to liquid cheesecake and was sold. There is a little hole on lid meant for sipping the milk cap through. To make matters even better, the staff was amazing-- walking me through the menu and giving me tips and tricks. I got a cute little reward card and learned that if you bring back your cup, you get 10% off your next tea! Sustainability AND savings! I also learned that they use no powders or artificial flavorings-- everything is fresh and real! I will definitely be a lifelong customer at Milk Jar.",

I wondered where it was, so I clicked in for more info, and was pretty psyched when I realized, woah, this is right down the strip mall from my favorite Indian restaurant, Shaan. \n\nI wouldn't normally review something after a first visit because I like to try multiple things and have a few experiences to write about. However, I have been thinking about the Strawberry milk tea with boba and a milk cap I ordered ever since I first visited the Milk Bar about five days ago. I wasn't even sure what a milk cap was until I tried it. So rich and decadent. It made me feel opulent AF, y'all. When paired with strawberry, it was like the perfect berries and cream boba tea. So psyched to go back! Especially because I have a powerful need to try the Unicorn Poop ice cream.\n\nBonus points for their all-gendered restroom. And as a side note, getting a lovely treat from Milk Bar is a super calming way to wind down after spending quite awhile in line at the Joann Fabrics across the parking lot.",

With the price being $5+, I didn't want to try something without knowing at all what it was like, and I think sampling would be a big help here. \nMy husband and I both got the rolled ice creams and they were really good and fresh.

I was just looking for something close to chain brand level, but Milk Bar Cafe is awesome!\n\nI had milk cap oolong tea w/ boba. I realized that I forgot to ask for less sweet after placing the order, but the drink turned out to be just right. The taste of tea was legit. The milk cap was probably the saltiest one I've ever had, but it went well with the tea. The boba are sticky and soft. I like that they have a mix of black and white boba - it doesn't affect the taste but just makes me happier by seeing them lol\n\nThe staff was helpful and friendly. He seems passionate about the business. In general I think the place is a must-try for good boba tea in Cincy.",

Definitely probably some of the best boba you'll find in cincy. The two guys running the show when I was there were super nice and welcoming. You could tell they were having fun  with what they were doing. I'm not super into Thai rolled ice cream but they also have that here along with cereal bowls. Both are customizable with toppings of your choice.\n\nI went with the plain oolong milk tea because I have to judge their classic before I come back and get something else. The drinks come with a plastic cup that's reusable, and they encourage you to bring it back for a small discount on your next beverage. The boba was tasty. I'll definitely be back.\n\nIf you're in the mood to try something different, go for a milk cap tea. If you're not sure the best way to drink it, make sure you ask the guys to teach you. Enjoy!",

All of these items are pretty hipster these days; rolled ice cream went from zero to everywhere in Cincinnati overnight it seems. That doesn't mean it's not good. In fact, it's darn good.\n\nDLW and I stopped for a little pick-me-up on a Sunday evening, and found the place happily buzzing. The server at the counter patiently explained the ordering process to us, and several more times after we ordered. Our milk teas were freshly prepared, with good quality ingredients. I highly recommend the mango version.\n\nI have a couple of concerns, though. Breakfast cereal isn't my thing, but I thought the offerings were pretty routine and overpriced. Nothing here is cheap, but you get what you pay for. I worry that opening a place like this in the fall is foolhardy, since summer would be the shank of the season. Still I recommend you get here and support this business.",

I've been here three times in the past three weeks since I've discovered it and I'm so sad I didn't find it earlier! I'm moving and am sad I couldn't have enjoyed these longer. The rolled ice cream is also amazing. I like it for the same reasons that I like dip n dots. It's light and fun to eat with all the layers of air and creamy ice cream in each bite. I had the cookies with vanilla ice cream with pocky and chocolate syrup and it was delicious. I love how they offer unlimited toppings with your rolled ice cream. Also impressed with the skill it takes to make rolled ice cream, it looks exhausting. this place will have you never wanting any other kind of Bubble tea!! This place is a no frills, good quality, small business and I highly recommend trying it: Hope to one day see this grow into something that can be offered in a food truck setting because it's just that good.",

I've tried both the rolled ice cream (campfire dream, with chocolate, marshmallow, and graham crackers blended in- SO good) and several varieties of the bubble tea. I loooove the milk cap bubble tea here. It's basically a bonus layer of creamy goodness at the top of your tea. Slightly salty, slightly sweet, so delicious. The tea always tastes very fresh. The staff is very willing to help walk you through menu options (as there are several) if it's your first time in. It's a little pricey (regular size milk cap tea with boba runs you around $6) but I am sure that this is due to the high-quality ingredients. They have a rewards program so make sure to get a card if you go in. If you're a returning customer, take your reusable cup back for an eco friendly option.",

However, this was the first time I've experienced a milk cap! I can't remember seeing it on previous menus, or maybe I just didn't know what it was to order.\n\nI tried their strawberry/green tea combo with the milk cap....WOW! This thing is half tea/half dessert as the milk cap has a dense, rich cheesecake flavor. Blown away.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our tea, I saw them rolling out the ice cream for someone else's order. It literally starts as a liquid and then freezes as they prepare it. The 2nd time we came, I knew I had to get this, so I went for the \"Smores\" (ice cream, with graham cracker, marshmallow, and chocolate syrup). Being a fatty, I of course added Cinnamon Toast Crunch, extra marshmallow, and M&Ms as toppers (unlimited toppings free with any ice cream). Not to sound redundant but....WOW! The ice cream was super creamy and flavorful, and the toppings gave just enough textural variety to keep it interesting from the first scoop until the last.\n\nThe only downside to this place is the price. No matter what you get, you're going to walk out for ~$8/pp. Pretty pricey for ice cream or boba, however you can see and taste the premium ingredients and process, so I am ok paying a premium price for the high quality product.\n\nSo happy that Milk Bar Cafe opened up, and I look forward to giving this place more than their fair share of my disposable income in the future!",

From the first sip you can tell that all ingredients are freshly brewed and made for each day. Everything is all natural. The menu is right on the best with many signature drinks that are very unique to their brand (definitely order their matcha drinks because those are top knots). The staff are very friendly and make me feel so welcomed every time I come.

Located in a very convenient plaza with other food options and grocers, Milk Jar Cafe is the perfect spot for those with a rolled ice cream/bubble tea craving or want to try something different than traditional dessert options. There's a couple of tables and a few chairs outside for hot, summer day seating, and a pleasant  and adequately spacious interior that will suffice medium sized crowds. The one worker there was very polite and diligent in making sure I got what I wanted on my ice cream and was quick to prepare my girlfriend's bubble tea without error. Milk Jar Cafe was a very chill place to just take a breather in the middle of a busy day and took a big chunk of stress off my mind. If you like ice cream or bubble tea, enjoy seeing it made, or just have a sweet tooth, Milk Jar Cafe can definitely cater for you so give it a try (or multiple as they offer loyalty visit rewards as you order!)",

Glad they found it because I will be coming back here for their milk teas and rolled ice cream.  My kids loved it. Their cups are fancy since they actually print out the names of the order and put the labels on the cups.  What is more special is the drink itself. Very flavorful and you can actually see layers of the ingredients that they put in there.  I highly recommend this place if you like boba teas.",

      "text": "I have tried many boba tea places in Cincinnati, and this is by far the most authentic and delicious we have!  The original boba recipe, Ceylon tea with tapioca pearls and dairy, is absolute perfection.  The tea flavor is dark and smoky as it would be served in the finest tea rooms around the world. The tapioca pearl texture was just as firm and chewy as it should be. As well as the classics, they have all the different combinations of flavors and textures that have developed from the original, so you can mix and match to your heart's content. My friend had the matcha boba tea and said it was perfect matcha; he also had the rolled ice cream, which is a work of art and the most fresh ice cream you could have with no additives, frozen and mixed from liquid right in front of you. Fascinating. It's sparkling clean and has wonderful, cheerful, patient service. They'll teach you about boba tea if this is new to you. Oh, and it's truly wonderful that you get a 5% discount for bringing your cleaned container back to be reused!! I was feeling so guilty about how much plastic you use in one serving of restaurant boba tea that I started making my own boba tea at home. It's pretty good, and way cheaper, but Milk Jar's is so much better and worth every penny.  It's the only place I'll go to from now on in Cincinnati, and I'll start doing my other shopping in that center just as an excuse to visit Milk Jar!",

They also have a few Thai-Asian flavors that are inspired by one of the owners who is from Thailand (Pandan, taro, matcha, and black sesame!) They also have ~4 vegan flavors!\n\nThe best dessert place I have been to in Cincinnati. It doesn't look like much from the outside, we weren't sure if they were open, but decided to park and walk over to see. The interior could be more inviting, maybe replace the metal chairs and add some plants or pillows but I liked the playful yellow décor and wall graphics. \n\nThere are so many options to choose from, made-to-order waffle cones, small batch ice cream, cakes, cheesecake, their famous torched marshmallows, and sundaes (including one with a croissant bread budding). We got the cheesecake and two scoops of ice cream. The peanut butter midnight snack was memorable with a rich pb flavor and huge chunks of chocolate cookie bits. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. Highly recommend trying a few things. Will definitely come back to get a sundae!",

      "text": "Hello Honey has the absolute best ice cream in Cincinnati (no debate in my eyes!) They have homemade, small batch ice cream that is just so creamy and delicious. The amount of flavors to choose from might make your head spin, but that's a good problem to me. I love going in and trying completely different things and mixing random flavors. Some of my favorites are what's pictured here- the Blueberry cheesecake and Brown Butter Caramel. They are both incredible! You can also try different samples if you can't decide on what to get at first.\n\nMy absolute favorite part about this place is the homemade waffle cone. They're made fresh to order so it's slightly warm when you get it. I've never had a better cone! I consider them to be a hidden gem because they're on the part of Vine Street that has been around for a long time so definitely go out and support them. You won't regret it!",

My boyfriend and I came here after work on Friday afternoon. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the chocolate chip mint ice cream which he thoroughly enjoyed! I ordered the he brownie and cream ice cream with a waffle cone and a toasted marshmallow on top. It was melt in our mouth delicious. The toasted marshmallow was an excellent touch and looked awesome! The waffle cone was warm when it was served and had melted chocolate chips in the bottom of the cone which was my favorite part. \n\nI highly recommend Hello Honey especially if you are an ice cream / waffle cone fanatic! You certainly will not be disappointed!",

      "text": "My nephews and I were looking for a good dessert shop to finish out the night.  We decided to give Hello Honey a try...and it was absolutely AMAZING, to say the least.\n\nFirst thing we noticed about Hello Honey was how clean it was, from the doors to the sitting area.  The wonderful smells and warmth of the interior made us feel comfortable.  We were greeted by the friendly owners who answered our questions and made suggestions, because we were overwhelmed.\nThere were so many choices of ice cream, toppings and cakes...all made from SCRATCH! \n\nMy older nephew ordered the Peanut Butter Sunday with peanut butter ice cream and freshly toasted marshmallow.  My younger nephew ordered the Brownie Time Sundae, with a piping hot brownie, Honey Vanilla ice cream, chocolate and caramel syrup.  I ordered what the owners suggested:  The Crispy Bread Pudding Sundae.  My sundae had a buttery toasted croissant made into a crispy pudding, topped with a scoop of Honey Vanilla Ice Cream.  We didn't just enjoy our dessert.\nOur desserts took us to a blissful place of pure happiness. \nMy nephews and I have chosen to make this our official \"Dessert Place\" when we visit Downtown again.\n\nI can truly recommend this place as a \"Must Visit\" for anyone living in or visiting Cincinnati.  Hello Honey is well worth the trip and money.",

      "text": "Being overshadowed by Graeter's, and all the creamy whip places of Cincinnati, Hello Honey is the most low key and underrated place to get dessert in Cincinnati. They also to happen to make the best ice cream in Cincinnati.  \n\nHello Honey is hidden downtown where no one would ever look for such a gem. In the outskirts of the central business district. \n\nThey make their own fresh ice cream and everything else they make that goes with the ice cream to compliment it, they make to order. \n\nI'm talking about fresh made waffle cones. A giant brownie that you have to wait 30ish minutes for that they bring straight out to you in the skillet it was cooked in. Mouth watering, melt in your mouth unreal goodness. \n\nEverything here is amazing and you literally couldn't go wrong if you tried. If you're going to stick with only ice cream, my favorites are \"Brownie & Cream\" and \"Cookies & Pie\". \n\nIf you get the brownie make sure you get a scoop of ice cream to go on top of it. If you get a root beer float here, it is the most boujee but most amazing float you will ever have. Every piece of Cheesecake I've had here has been amazing. Also, If they have it when you're there, the Banana Fosters Is out of this world.\n\nLastly as far as things go food wise here, if anything is on the menu with a toasted marshmallow, Just do it. Don't question it. \n\nHello Honey also usually has at least two vegan options of ice cream/sorbet and they are actually super yummy. \n\nOutside of all the amazing ice cream and baked goods at Hello Honey and the cute branding from the sketches on the menu board or the polka dot bowls for your ice cream, the woman and guy who run the place are always the nicest people on the planet and you can really tell they enjoy what they are doing and that they are passionate about it.\n\nThese are the reasons why every time my parents come down from Dayton they make us go here, and why it's also a rainy day hide away for me. \n\nIf you've been living in Cincy and haven't gone here yet, you best prioritize it because you're going to be salty you've been missing out for so long.",

It always seems they close fairly early in comparison to times i'd be downtown, but on the first night of Blink we came early enough for the parade to stop in. \n\nThe inside of the shop isn't much to look at, its very simple, however the flavors certainly make up for this.  It was very busy and there was only one gentleman working, and boy was he working his butt off! I have never seen such hustle in an employee and the owners should be proud of this. He apologized that he was the only one there but the crowd was luckily being very understanding. \n\nThe ice cream here is small batch and made with all natural ingredients (nothing artificial). The chalk board states the eggs are cage free and the dairy is hormone free! Their flavors rotate and are seasonal. If youd like to plan ahead they keep the current flavor list on their website. They are happy to provide you with samplings of the ice cream flavors before making your final decision. Their desserts beyond ice cream are all made on site. The store itself is filled with the aroma of freshly made waffle cones!\n\nI sampled the honey lavender and the banana honeycomb. Both were fabulous so I opted for a scoop of each, with a waffle cone, and homemade marshmallow toasted atop. The second scoop didnt quite fit so it made its way into a side dish. I think in the future id opt for the waffle bowl instead. The waffle cone was the best ive ever had. Sadly I have to say, while the marshmallow was good, it didnt add to the ice cream what I thought it would, and might skip that in the future.",

      "text": "Love the ice cream. Flavors listed are what one tastes. Not too subtle, but not a punch in the face either. After sampling a couple flavors, I decided on the banana honeycomb and the peanut butter late night snack. Bits of honeycomb candy added a little crunch to the banana honeycomb. The peanut butter late night stnack has pieces of cookies in it. This added another textural component. The taste of the ice cream at self remind me of a peanut butter milkshake. Both were consumed in a made to order waffle cone bowl. Waffle cones and bowls are smaller at Hello Honey than most places. With the richness of the ice cream, the smaller portion is perfect. \n\nThe toasted marshmallow was a let down. While it looked delicious, it was not melted on the inside. Essentially the marshmallow needed to be picked up and eaten as it's own entity. The spoon did not cut through it. \n\nIce cream at Hello Honey is made with humanely sourced ingredients. Ingredients are also hormone free, as well as free of artificial dyes and flavors. All flavors are made right here in Cincinnati. In fact, ice creams (and baked goods,) are made right in the shop. Flavors rotate seasonally. Hello Honey will even cater for your next event.",

One of the things I was disappointed about was they don't offer the other treats anymore (if you look through the pictures on here you'll see what I mean) it's basically just ice cream and sundae type items, cones, etc. \n\nThe ice cream was very good; thick, rich and creamy. The only issue for me is it comes out kind of soft so if you don't eat it fast enough the flavors will melt together. Overall, very delicious ice cream, if that's all you're expecting you'll be pleased.",

      "text": "Hello Honey is fun and cute! I had been wanting to try them for some time and finally got her chance. I have been twice now. I love that they offer different desserts with their ice cream but they constantly change. I like being able to experience something new. Their ice cream is pretty tasty! \n\nThe first time I went I had the Cookies & Creme ice cream in a cone with a toasted marshmallow on top. This was a great combination. The ice cream was good. If I remember correctly they even put crushed up graham crackers as well as Oreos. It was a good small twist to the classic cookies and cream ice cream. The cherry on top was the toasted homemade marshmallow. It was so good. Who would have ever thought a marshmallow on top of ice cream would be do delicious? My daughter enjoyed eating the ice cream from the bottom of the cone. She bit the bottom and let the ice cream run down. Shrugs! The things 1 year olds do. Haha! \n\nThe second time we went we got their S'more Ice Cream Dessert. It was the ice cream of your choice with graham crackers stuffed in the side of the cup and topped with chocolate. Of course we added the toasted marshmallow on top. This was very good and different as well. \n\nOverall, Hello Honey has some good ice cream and fun different desserts.",

But after a large lunch, we needed a walk to digest and just happened to find this hidden gem! Boy are we glad we did!\n\nHello Honey is very unassuming, with simple but cute decor that is picture worthy. They specialize in small batch homemade ice cream. All the flavors are unique and they have seasonal specials as well. \n\nYour best bet is walking here as there is limited street parking. There are plenty of parking garage if you want to drive and plant your vehicle there. \n\nThe owner and staff are very friendly and will happily let you sample to your heart's content. Flavors very slightly daily and do sell out. I ended up with the lavender honey and espresso brittle and was not disappointed. Their ice cream is creamy and flavorful without being too sweet. I definitely recommend trying Hello Honey!",

My. God. The cream itself is amazing; smooth, sweet, perfect.  The flavors are creative, fun and mouth watering.  But that's also true of the other Cincinnati ice cream greats. What sets little ol' Hello Honey apart, what gives it a real case for best in town is the fresh made, warm cone.  It's worth waiting for, my friends. They make the cone fresh, it's still warm when they drop in a big old scoop of cold, creamy goodness...and magic is made.  It gets a little melty and that's how it should be.  You must get a scoop here!",

The ambiance is super charming with the cafe-style aesthetic with charming illustrations on the walls and pleasant jazz music, which made it even cozier. The man behind the cash register was helpful, welcoming and kind.\nMy friend wanted to have ice cream, I wanted something warm, and this place had both. Even though I'm not a \"ice cream in winter\" person, I sampled the honey lavender and instantly changed my mind. We also ordered the bread pudding with banana honey comb and we're going to have dreams about it forever. The bread pudding was served hot on the skillet and it was moist in the inside, flaky and a bit salty on the top, which complimented awesomely with the sweet ice cream. There's caramel sauce on the bottom and every bite is bursting; we thought we weren't going to finish it and we ended up finishing the entire thing and wanting more.\nIf you had a bad day, come here with a friend and it'll cheer you right up. The greatest tragedy is that Hello Honey doesn't exist in Chicago and I'm going to be craving for it when I go back home.",

I finally got to try it this week, and was not at all disappointed. After sampling pistachio (yum), brown butter caramel (also yum), and honey lavender, I settled on the honey lavender. I've been on a lavender kick lately since it's so refreshing. The flavor was not as mild and subtle as you might think-- it was clearly honey lavender. They offer different gourmet toppings like scorched marshmallows or fudge, but I just got mine plain. They also offer other fun desserts. The prices are a little high, but it's a downtown shop where all of the ice cream is made from scratch, so the prices made sense. The shop has a great ambiance inside and even the name is cute and inviting. If I am ever downtown again with some time to kill, I'll definitely be stopping back in.",

I did sample both first. I got them in a waffle cup, which should not be mistaken for a bowl. It is a small cup and the ice cream is stacked. Overall it was good. They each had their own favor. I think I prefer the brown buttered caramel. The waffle cup was good also.\n\nStaff was friendly just not very fast since it was one person working. But overall good customer service.

Not upbeat or cheery that you would think an ice cream place would be. \n\nNonetheless, they were out of the key lime flavor when I went. There is a multitude of flavor combinations that are exquisite. Unfortunately, the staff was adamant about the two sample rule. I have never been limited at an ice cream shop on samples. Especially when it's really hard to choose and the sample is literally a half of a teaspoon (NOT tablespoon). This was a complete turn off for me, therefore I have to deduct one star. \n\nI ended up choosing the brown butter caramel and turned it into a brownie sundae with the added bonus of a homemade toasted marshmallow. \nThe ice cream is rich and very flavorful. The portion size was appropriate. The brownie was delicious. I just can't get jiggy with the two sample rule, especially since the ice cream isn't cheap. I paid 7 dollars for a brownie sundae + $1 extra for the homemade marshmallow.",

Everything is made fresh in-store with natural ingredients and attention to detail. \n\nWe got the brownie chunk ice cream sundae with caramel honey topping and toasted marshmallow in a waffle bowl. The ice cream was delicious with a fresh cream taste. But the stars of the show were the waffle bowl (light, crisp, hot off the griddle--everything you hope a waffle bowl will be) and the toasted marshmallow (fluffy and light, made fresh in store, and toasted with a torch right on the spot--it melts in your mouth and leaves the pleasant crunch of the toastedness on your tongue). \n\nThe only thing keeping Hello Honey from five stars is their limited hours (they close at 7pm on weekdays) and their dingy interior. Honestly, the place is in disrepair and would make me want to turn around if not for the other yelp reviews. But push past first looks and you'll discover a gem of an ice cream experience just waiting for you.",

I sampled a few-- the earl gray one, cookies and pie and lavender honey and Dutch chocolate. They all lacked serious flavor. It just tasted like a lightly flavored frown cream. The texture was really good though ‍ but if you're looking for a flavor punch then you're gonna be disappointed. Which if you're adventurous and seeking out fun flavors like they offer here, you are looking for flavor. \n\nWe also tried a torched marshmallow on top and it was grainy. Even my 5 year old said he didn't like it. What 5 year old turns down a marshmallow?! Maybe I've spoiled him and his taste buds by introducing him to Jeni's Ice cream ‍ \n\nI really hope they continue to develop their recipes at Hello Honey because I would love to see a fun flavored ice cream place thrive!",

Amazing. Very thick and rich. They froth the milk and make it from scratch. No mixes here. It tastes like liquid fine chocolate.\n\nAnd their specialty is unusual ice-cream flavors like lavender honey. But they also have cookies, brownies and cheesecake.\n\nBecause all is custom-made, items are priced a bit higher than some -- $4.95 + $1 for the marshmallow. But it's not crazy, and perfect for a special treat like when you are downtown at the Aronoff or Fountain Square (a block from either one). The staff are very accommodating as well. Try it!

I decided to go with the espresso, and I normally always order peanut butter anywhere, and went with the s'mores sundae. The gentleman worker was friendly and played some great music. Would definitely return to try more homemade flavors as they seem to change, and try out some other sundaes!",

      "text": "Why, why, why do people open up artisan ice cream shops? Every time someone opens one up, it means I HAVE to try it. I mean, I suppose if I had self control I could stop myself, but it'd be a helluva lot easier if they just didn't keep popping up so I could spend my daily caloric intake on them.\n\nHello Honey is a quaint little ice cream shop in between 5th and 6th on Vine. I pass this place everyday on my way to work and one day, while feeling the need for ice cream, I FINALLY stopped in. And let me tell you, I WILL be back. \n\nI ordered a sundae with nutella sauce (F#%& YEAH NUTELLA), homemade whipped cream and a toasted marshmallow. Yes, I said toasted marshmallow. Ugh. The guy recommended the cookie and pie ice cream as the base and I was not disappointed. The ice cream is made by them, and with all the homemade ingredients on top I was not disappointed.\n\nMy only qualm is that most ice cream confections run $6-10. That's a little pricey, but I understand it to be because they make everything with the freshest ingredients and it's homemade. It won't be somewhere I frequent everyday, otherwise I'll be fat and poor, but it's definitely somewhere I will have no guiltiness in splurging on.",

      "text": "Hello Honey - A Cincinnati 4, Bay Area 3. There are so many things about Hello Honey that I want to love. Ice cream made in small batches on the premises. Seasonal flavors. Interesting flavor combinations aka a departure from the classic flavor profiles such as vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate and a veer toward the more modern flavors like strawberry balsamic and chocolate bourbon. Homemade salted caramel, made to order waffle cones and waffle cups, and homemade marshmallow torched in front of you. It's an amateur foodie ice cream lover's paradise. \n\nThe service: it's great! They definitely give you time and space to peruse the menu which is always nice when you're visiting a place for the first time. And they're happy to suggest toppings! \n\nThe ice cream: they have the fat content perfect - enough to placate your inner fattie with just a tad of guilt for consuming dessert before dinner. It's the perfect consistency - smooth and thick. The only qualms I have are with the flavor themselves: I found the two scoops (salted caramel and blackberry cheesecake) and my friend's two scoops (peanut butter and cookies and pie) were just very mild. Or too subtle. I personally prefer when ice cream flavors are more bold and robust and you actually taste the different components that make up that flavor. \n\nHello Honey is a great addition to the Cincinnati ice cream scene. They've got the base for a great ice cream experience! I just hope/wish they don't water down the ice cream taste for the Cincinnati palate!",

      "text": "Last week I had the day off and wanted to take advantage of the beautiful weather. I was craving a fresh scoop and ventured downtown to try hello honey. I ended up parking a few blocks away (parking is crazy during the week!!) but wasn't too bothered because of the gorgeous weather. The spot is incredibly adorable- fits about 15-20 people with plenty of seating space. At that hour (2 PM on a Tuesday afternoon), it wasn't too busy at all. There were so many interesting flavors to choose from - espresso nut brittle, honey vanilla, brown butter caramel, and a fresh strawberry sorbet. I ordered the espresso brittle with the toasted caramel (pictured here). I was so impressed with the quality of the ice cream and rich flavors. I could tell the marshmallow was made in house and it was toasted to perfection. As if this couldn't get better, I also got the waffle cone. The cone was warm, freshly made and perfectly paired with the coolness of the ice cream. This is one of the best ice cream desserts I've had in cincinnati, hands down. I'd love to come back and try out other flavors! I'm happy to give this place 5 stars, just wish it was a bit easier to access during the day, and the location had later hours.",

As there are several unique flavors, it took a long time for us all to pick out what we wanted. The staff were so patient with us making decisions and offered suggestions when we asked for it.\n\nI ultimately decided to go with the milkshake of the day, which was a peanut butter milkshake and it was heavenly. My sisters and mom all tried it and love it. They all decided to go with the brown butter caramel ice cream, which I heard was equally amazing.\n\nOne of my sisters had decided to get a homemade toasted marshmallow on her ice cream and, to her dismay, it fell off and onto the floor within the first couple of bites. The employee who had clear, horn-rimed glasses was happy to prepare another for her for no charge. He was helpful and attentive to us throughout are time there. We were sad that we had forgotten to ask him what his name was. He was so nice.\n\nI'm sad that I don't live in the Cincinnati area as this would be my go-to ice cream place!",

This place is divine ... the waffle cones are amazing and come out hot. I don't even really particularly like waffle cones and I liked this one. Normally I'm one who is stingy on my calories. Like I will certainly eat fatty buttery high calorie foods but not junk. I don't do junk food. The pro of the taste must outweigh the high calorie con, i.e. Positive return on investment for my calories and this place exemplifies why I won't touch grocery store ice cream but I'd gobble this down in a second! Oh and the waffle cone too.\n\nThe toasted marshmallow seems interesting but I'm there for ice cream. My husband I shared the caramel and brownies and cream, 2 scoops on a waffle cone (ordered by my husband) and we both wanted to buy another one after we finished eating. The ice cream is literally the perfect consistency and the waffle cone crispy, sweet, and delightfully warm! We will certainly be back.",

My best friend and I were looking for desserts to eat after brunch and thanks to Yelp I was able to find this place. \n\nThey make their own ice cream in creative flavors like lavender and honey or smoked butterscotch (which is what I got) but what makes this store different from the rest is they have option to top off your ice cream with ROASTED MARSHMALLOWS!! \n\nOH. EM. GEE! It's a $1 more but I must recommend you do it! It's literally heaven in a cup.",

      "text": "I happened to walk by this on my way to Cheapside and the name itself called to me! I had to find out what this was and go in! And of course, it has my favorite treat: ice cream!! \n\nAfter a delightful meal at Cheapside, I make it back here and nobody is in here, so I get the full attention of the owner and he lets me try everything! I was so impressed with the flavors, it was hard to choose, but I decided vanilla lavender and nothing but espresso and they were GOOD CHOICES. \n\nWaffle cones are made to order and they are decadent! It was incredible, I have never liked a waffle cone so much and I LOVE WAFFLE CONES. It has a thin, light airy crunch (unlike normal cones) and it crumbles easily, but not too easily that the ice cream melts into it and makes it soft. It was so perfect. But I made the poor choice of getting it in a cup and it was difficult to eat. Go with the cone because that's just normal and easier. \n\nI was also up sold with the toasted marshmallow and it was worth it. Expensive as hell - a dollar for a marshmallow (think, you can buy an entire bag for this much which has like 100 of them in there), but good. It added another element of sweetness and flavor with the brûlée crunch and smokey burntness (yes I'm good at making up words). Def try it. \n\nI'd love to go back if I come to cincy, so I'm glad I have friends here to visit! Oh hello, honey!",

      "text": "Wow! Just, wow!! I take ice cream very seriously, so believe me when I tell you, this place does ice right!\n\nI visited for the first time today with my dad. They're awesome about letting you sample, which is good because I can be super indecisive. I tried the brownies and cream first and the brownies pieces were perfect. The Brownie  Time Sundae brownie uses the very same brownie, so I knew that was a win! Then it was just a matter or what ice cream to put on top of it. The Brown Butter Caramel was so sweet and full of flavor. But in the end, Peanut Butter Brittle won out. I'm really not a brittle fan, but the peanut butter ice cream was so rich and the brittle was such a sweet caramel that it totally surprised. I also decided top it with on of their toasted marshmallows because...why wouldn't I??? This sundae was perfection! The brownie was sweet, soft and moist. And this ice cream was some of the creamiest ice cream I have ever tasted! It wasn't icy in the least.\n\nThe only teeny, tiny, itsy, bitsy complaint I have is that their hot fudge hardens quickly. So if you don't eat it right away, you'll have some chocolate chunks stuck to your plate.\n\nI will definitely be returning to Hello Honey!",

It seems I have been passing by for months and missing out! They have so many yummy desserts I want to try, and they have a ton of unique flavors as well.\n\nI had the honey toast with blackberry cheesecake ice cream and a toasted marshmallow. It was fantastic! The honey toast was like a pound cake and it went very well with the ice cream and marshmallow. It tasted as delicious as it looked. \n\nMy sister and I shared the dessert and they were nice enough to throw in an extra toasted marshmallow for us. Hello Honey makes me happy :)\n\nI can't wait to go back and try their cakes and crepes!",

      "text": "During my weekend visit in Cincinnati, my friends and I frequented Hello Honey twice. We are a fan of their ice cream and desserts. The store is so cute and the owner is really friendly and personable. The owner keeps up with what's trending in the ice cream industry as I overheard her talking to a regular customer. There is several parking areas around Hello Honey. I think there was a parking deck next to it. \n\nFlavors do change and alter each week, They do have very interesting and smart concepts/concoctions to ice cream flavors that my friends loved. I tend to like more of the basic flavors like Vanilla and Chocolate. The flavors that I was able to try:\n- Lavender Honey: interesting flavor and it definitely tastes like lavender. It was good and I think it's one of the popular flavors from the menu. \n- Vanilla Honey: this was my all-time favorite flavor. It was a twist to the traditional vanilla flavor. I ordered this both times I was at Hello Honey. \n\nPricing is under $10 for each item. I think it's $5 for one scoop of ice cream and $6 for two scoops. Of course I went for the two scoops. The scoops are very generous so one scoop is more than enough. \n\nOverall, I wish there was a Hello Honey in Georgia. We really liked our experience at Hello Honey.",

We were encouraged to sample as much as we liked - everything was so delicious, it was hard to make a decision. My husband ended up with Espresso Hazelnut and another delicious flavor - and I made him ask for it to be topped with a Toasted Marshmallow. OMG, this is THE perfect touch for any bowl of ice cream. You can watch them toast the homemade marshmallow using a mini-torch right before your eyes.  I had a Banana Toffee sundae with Maple Hazelnut Crunch ice cream. The only thing that would have made it more perfect was if I'd added a toasted marshmallow of my own. ;-)\n\nParking in the area is not very good - I swear, I would be there so much more if that wasn't an issue!",

If I go to an ice cream shop, I want real, homemade Ice cream, if I go to a steak house, I want an authentic grilled steak. Hello Honey is just that. A true ice cream shop. They have a lot of unique, Rich, & delicious flavors. The ice cream flavors are luscious and definitely not your neighborhood strawberry or mint chip. \n\nHello honey has a variety of other desserts, cake, warm & cold desserts, etc. they have a little something for everyone. Not doubt if you're looking for a delicious dessert or ice cream, Hello Honey is an amazing place to check out! My only downfall on the visit is that 1. The place can be busy so you don't really get the time or assistance needed regarding flavors, dessert options, etc. the rep working the counter was nice just seemed rushed so i didn't get the amount of time I felt was needed to review the options on the menu board. You only get two samples of ice cream as well. Kind of a bummer because they have so many unique flavors. \n\nThe Parking is also horrible on this location. If you're lucky you'll get a Street Meter spot. Or you'll have to walk a little bit or settle for a parking garage spot. Overall a good experience! A must try!",

There are no words to capture the beauty of this place. \nIf you have ever liked anything made of dairy and even made eye contact with a cow, you should go to this place. \nThis ice cream is made in small batches from organic milk and amazing flavours. The cones and waffle bowls are baked FRESH when you order and of course you absolutely must get the marshmallow (made in house) torched. Don't walk there, run!!! Because once a flavor is gone, it usually takes a while to come back around ( check the blackboard for current flavors). Feel free to say hi to me, I'm always there ... getting more ice cream.",

The Asian lady behind the counter is SO sweet and will let you try as many flavors as you want. Small space, but plenty of tables and bar stools for you to sit and dig in.",

I was amazed by their choices that were listed on a big board above the tables. We had checked out the photos on yelp! beforehand and everyone wanted their dish topped with a toasted marshmallow. \n\nWe were met by a smiling woman who was happy to help with any questions we had. I was overwhelmed by the flavors list, so I ordered the brownie sundae with a toasted marshmallow for $1 extra. This-made-my-day!!!  You know a place is awesome when they break out a blow torch. The treats came out quickly on a cute bamboo tray. The dishes were perfect and the ice cream was smooth and perfect over the hot brownie. The toasted marshmallow made me think I was right back at Girl Scout camp, but with plumbing and clean clothes. Amazing. \n\nThe only thing that would have been better was the AC cranked up. But, it was a gorgeous day outside and we cooled off eating the amazing ice cream. \n\nI am so glad we tried this place. We will be back for more!",

And word to the wise, don't forget to get a home made hand torched TOASTED MARSHMALLOW added to any dish. Holy Cannoli! Out of this world, awesome. Actually I might even goes as far to say it's the best marshmallow I've ever had. \n\nDo yourself a flavor (haha. See what I did there?) and try this place out! You will not be disappointed!",

      "text": "Nutella Icecream and a fresh roasted marshmallow?! yes please!\n\nI loved that all of the ice-cream is made there and it was absolutely delicious. I prefer fresh marshmallows so HH was right up my alley! \n\nThe service and decor were right on point! It reminded me of my trips to sweet shops and bakeries in Asia. \n\nThe only think I didn't enjoy was the green tea chocolate cake. I am a bit of matcha purist and I think chocolate ruins and overpowers that flavor. The chocolate cake and matcha mousse were not a pairing that I enjoyed so I ended up scooping the mousse out and I enjoyed it thoroughly! \n\nThe menu is also developing and absolutely delicious combos are available so everyone can try a little bit of everything!",

      "text": "Hmm~ I hate to be the downer among so many good reviews... Maybe it was because my husband and I came mid-day on a Tuesday, before their new tubs of ice cream were being brought out.\n\nWhen we went, the owner was really friendly and offered us multiple times to try different flavors which was really nice but every time she opened the tubs of ice cream there was barely any ice cream left...Maybe enough for two scoops of ice cream in each! I just felt like the store didn't care to keep their flavors stocked up... And that we weren't getting fresh ice cream. This part was not too bad, because if I were to give them the absolute benefit of the doubt maybe their ice cream is just SO good that they're never stocked up! But regardless it started my experience on the wrong foot.\n\nMy husband, sister, and I shared a matcha green tea cake with a scoop of Guinness chocolate ice cream and I got a lemon meringue pie ice cream with their famous toasted marshmallow. Here's where my second disappointment came in... Our marshmallow was really small and granule-ey!!! The toasted part of the marshmallow was like biting a thick layer of crusted sugar. And parts of the marshmallow was melted and oosey but there were parts of the marshmallow that was not melted and again granule-ey!!!! I really don't know how to explain it other than by saying the marshmallow didn't have that puffy airy consistency all the way through... Parts of it seemed like it was a corner piece and the sugar hadn't melted or cooked enough in the cooking process.\n\nShe brought out the cake warm but because the place was so quiet we could hear her opening and closing the microwave to heat it up for us from the back... I think from watching kitchen nightmares I just don't like hearing and noticing that food service places have microwaves. \n\nThe cake was blah, but the two ice cream flavors were really fun and delicious. The ice cream itself was good, but I was disappointed in my experience as a whole and in feeling like the toasted marshmallow was too much of a gimmick. I want to go back and give this place another shot though because I hear their ice cream flavors are always changing, maybe my experience will be better next time!\n\nPs: the place is also located in the heart of downtown so it's really hard to find parking. We ended up just paying at one of the nearby parking structures.",

      "text": "What the heck have I been eating all of these years from those store brand ice creams or even Graeters??!! We came in on a warm day in February after hearing so much about this. We sampled so many of their flavors: salted caramel, brown butter, banana honeycomb, cookies and pie, etc. Everything was so good and creamy. Not too solid. We ended up getting a double of salted caramel and brownies and cream on a fresh waffle cone. I emphasize the freshness. It was still warm as we were eating the ice cream and had the fantastic smell of butter. The salted caramel was pure bliss. The brownies and cream was amazing as the brownie pieces were large, delicious and still soft like they had just been mixed in. I wanted another two scoops but my fear of how much fat I was ingesting kept me from going overboard. Needless to say, if you want to go on a diet, don't come here. Pretty sure one scoop is provably 600 calories on its own but totally worth it. We will definitely coming back especially in the spring when they have more flavors available",

It's a very tight race, and maybe it's my love for the underdog, but I adore Hello Honey.\n\nAs others have mentioned, it's run by a fantastic husband and wife team who is very happy to sit there as you ask them endless questions about flavors. \n\nHighlights include the toasted marshmallow, which I can't recommend highly enough (they seriously put marshmallow on your ice cream then torch it with a pastry torch. Awesome.) Though I haven't had it, I've seen them make fresh waffle cones, too, as in pour batter into a waffle iron, cook it, and make it a cone. How is that not incredible?\n\nThe flavors change regularly, and are all delicious, though as Samantha mentioned some are a bit less remarkable than others (go for a unique flavor rather than a regular flavor with unique things.) My personal favorites are the flavors sweetened by molasses, as it has a very unique flavor. \n\nWhich segues into the biggest point - from what I understand the name comes from them actually sweetening their ice cream with honey. Amazing!\n\nThe hours aren't the best if you don't work Downtown. It's a small operation, so they can't keep the convenient hours of the Fountain Square Graeter's. What they can do, however, is offer more unique, interesting flavors, extremely high quality ice cream, and a very personal touch.\n\nLove this place.",

Hello Honey takes the classic ice cream form and elevates it with creative flavor twists for a decidedly delicious take on a standard.\n\nFlavors are posted on a giant blackboard and at least some rotate on a regular basis. The person who took me was talking up the virtues of the bourbon ice cream (it wasn't a hard sell), but unfortunately they only have that on Thursdays and Fridays. Instead, I went with a scoop of Nutella ice cream and it was indeed the ice cream doppelganger of everybody's favorite chocolate-hazelnut spread. \n\nThere are fun extras like a giant homemade marshmallow blow-torched on top of your scoop in front of your eyes or a freshly-made waffle bowl. If you want to know the rotating flavors before you go, they are posted on Hello Honey's Facebook page. Prices are reasonable for the quality and scoop size (1 scoop is $3.50 and 2 scoops are $5), but with all the awesome flavor options, it would be nice to be able to get 2 flavors within the 1 scoop size and price (and maybe they would, I think I'll ask next time!).",

The owner remembered us from the last time we were there and even remembered what we had ordered.  She was so excited for us to try the new flavors she had we couldn't keep up with all the samples.  \n\nThey aren't always open for their posted hours.  I would suggest calling ahead to be sure they are open.",

I got the brownies and cream ice cream with a torched marshmallow on top (of course!), and it was amazing. The bits of brownie actually tasted like good, fudgy, homemade brownies! None of those cardboard-tasting, flavorless brownie chunks you get in most \"brownie\" ice cream. I was SUPER impressed. My boyfriend's brown butter caramel ice cream was just as good! I could eat this ice cream every day. I know the hours are weird, but seriously, you have to try it! It's worth the special trip.",

She was making ice cream for friends and family and kept hearing people tell her to start a business. She and her husband were looking to work together and decided to go for it! Out came a beautiful gourmet ice cream boutique. \n\nThe big selling point for me is that the flavors are incredibly unique. I got the impression that the owner creates the recipes herself. The staff is more than willing to let you try different ones before you make your final selection.

      "text": "This ice cream shop opened up near our office building just recently, so a coworker and I took the opportunity to go and try their wares during our lunch break. The owner makes all of the ice cream in the store, so its very fresh. They offer a wide variety of flavors, including the normal \"boring\" ones.\n\nWe agreed to split (it's definitely big enough to split) the honey toast (which takes 10 minutes to prepare) with the butter caramel cake ice cream. Unfortunately, we didn't plan enough time to eat in the store and had to request the item to go at the last minute, which apparently isn't recommended for the honey toast and the owner had reservations about serving it in this manner. She eventually put it in a box for us, and we ran out the door. We stopped briefly to taste our purchase and were more than pleased - the toast is warm, crunchy and buttery, and the ice cream matched it perfectly. I definitely hope to return and try some more of their flavors!\n\nEDIT 1/2/2013:\nHello Honey is now one of my favorite locations in Cincinnati. I try to go in almost every day I'm downtown, and can't wait to try the new flavors every week. The absolute must have item with any ice cream you get is the toasted marshmallow. The marshmallows are homemade and will change everything you know about the sticky treat (I refuse to eat the ones from the store now). The fact that they're toasted in front of you with a blowtorch doesn't hurt either.\n\nNew items are being added to the menu all the time as well, so don't be afraid to try something new. I haven't had a bad trip yet!",

I saw this place a couple of months ago but did not stop for a visit (ice cream during winter never made sense to me) but I filed in my mind as a have to try.  So like a true cincinnatian as soon as the weather broke 50 i put on my flip flops and headed to Hello Honey.  It was so worth the wait.  The ice cream is so rich and a flavorful and the toasted homemade marshmellow is better than any cherry.  I will def be back.",

We had the special lavender raspberry ice cream with the Dutch chocolate, in a homemade, made-to-order waffle bowl.  Who makes the waffles cones to order?! Amazing, crispy yet tender and went perfectly with the ice cream.\n\nIce cream: lavender can be a hard ingredient to use as it can get too flowery, but the combo with raspberry was perfect. A nice hint of lavender without feeling like you're eating potpourri.  \n\nWe also took 2 slices of the homemade cake to go, green tea and orange.  So incredibly light and fluffy.\n\nWe were visiting from Chicago and honestly, I wish Hello Honey would move to our town! You get what you pay for (which is completely reasonable in the first place): quality, unique flavors, rich ice cream, as well as great small business customer service.\n\nYou can't go wrong with this place, LOVE IT!!!",

Home-made ice cream, home-made marshmallows (which they toast while you wait and then place on top of the ice cream), home-made everything. Awesome stuff. Not to mention the owners are great, and talked with us for a half hour even though we walked in a few minutes before close. As a man, I can honestly say my favorite flavor was honey lavender, I ordered it based on the owners recommendation and hope they have it again next time. All four of our kids ate and loved the brownie and my wife enjoyed the caramel with cake chunks in it.  After sampling every flavor (all of them we great) we decided we had to come back and try something different next time.",

But the flavors and customer service are right on the nose.\n\nKudos to you for trying something daring in a city known for ice cream! Good luck with your venture, you definitely have one regular right here!",

Hello Honey is a great addition to downtown to have the variety and creatively of the gelato's places in OTR, but something that is downtown.  I hope during the summer they think about opening their place later at night especially during events.  Graeters did not do this for awhile after they first opened and when they did, they seem to do very good business.  Hello Honey is close enough to fountain square, I think they could do good business later on at night during the summer months.",

The two cherries on top were fresh dark red cherries!  Delicious.  My husband tried \"party in your mouth\" with a homemade marshmallow on top that my son loved watching being roasted with a tiny torch right before our eyes. My son had Dutch chocolate in a small waffle cone that was made on the spot when we ordered so it was still warm!  The staff was so friendly and helpful you wouldn't have known that we showed up just before closing time.

      "text": "Since our favorite local ice cream place has closed down for the season, we've started walking here for our treats. My partner's son and I require gluten free and dairy free options so I was really excited to find out Graeters offers four safe sorbet options.\n\nThe flavors available are lemon, raspberry, mango and watermelon. We have tried them all and decided raspberry and mango are the best.  My partner always gets a black raspberry chocolate chip. His flavor would definitely win in a taste test. If only it was available in gluten and dairy free!\n\nService here is fast and feels safe. There are a few benches nearby to sit and eat. Or you could cross the street and eat while walking on Wasson Way.",

But inside you'll find the same amazing ice cream, of course. \n\nOver the holidays, hubby loves to get the egg nog and/or the peppermint. I think their cinnamon in the best of season. \n\nBut my go-to flavors are the Black Raspberry Chocolate Chip and the S'mores. Sometimes topped with hot fudge, butterscotch and sprinkles. Yum!\n\nIf you've never been to Graeter's you gotta check it out. They have the biggest, best, most epically amazing chocolate chips you will ever find anywhere. Seriously, they will change your life!",

      "text": "This is a new #graeters ice cream shop for me. I attempted to get one of their new seasonal ice cream flavors here about a month ago and they were closed. Then about 2 weeks ago I stopped here again on my way home from work to get two scoops of their very well received caramel macchiato chip. My daughter wanted me to get some for her as she and her family were out of town and sometimes these seasonal flavors are gone too fast like the black forest cake flavor. I was thrilled to see that they were open! Again I parked on the side street just across from the store by the bowling alley. I find this to be very convenient.                                                                   When I entered there was constant foot traffic but it wasn't too busy. #Covid19 precautions were in place including facemasks and social distancing. This store is similar in size to the #otr Vine Street location. All of the customers looked to be students at XU. I was next in line and was glad to find that the flavor was available. I ordered two scoops for myself & 2 scoops for my daughter in a cup that to take home and put in the freezer. There were three employees. I was quickly greeted by a friendly employee. The female student who helped me said that all of the employees there were Xavier students. There are apartments for the Xavier students just around the corner. I find it cool that #graeters is there to provide employment for the students. It took about 3 to 4 minutes to  be served and walk out the door with two cups with lids of the #caramelmacchiatochip flavor in a bag with napkins and spoons. I really like the location of this #graeters.                                   I eventually tried my 2 scoops. It was very good. It was creamy, cold and had more than enough chocolate chips! Until next time stay healthy & be kind to each other. @yelpcincy #graeters #icecream #summertimetreat #xavier #xu",

      "text": "This is undoubtedly some quality ice cream. I sampled multiple flavors and they were all good. I especially liked the Banana Cream Pie flavor. However, I opted for a Carmel Coffee Frozen drink that was really disappointing. \n\nThe drink is advertised as being caramel ice cream with a shot of espresso overtop - but it's really a kind of milkshake that is more milk and ice than anything else. I could hardly taste the caramel and I couldn't taste the espresso at all. The only flavor came from the caramel syrup on top. \n\nThe service was okay - there was only one person working, though, so when I came in with my family (8 of us) he seemed kind of flustered. It made ordering and just being there in general kind of awkward - especially when other people came in. It was weird to me that only one person was working on a hot Saturday evening. \n\nI hope to come back and try some more ice cream but I'll definitely just stick with the basics.",

My reason for two stars is one night we went closer to closing time, and the doors were locked and the girl cleaning the store just kind of looked at us and kept cleaning. The store wasn't even supposed to be closed yet. I know it can be a pain having people come in a little before closing, but you should serve customers until the time you are supposed to.

      "text": "Nothing in life is constant, but my Saturday afternoon ritual of visiting this establishment will likely not end any time soon.  Every time I've been here, the employees have been incredibly knowledgeable and patient. Go ahead: ask them what the difference between ice cream and gelato is. They would be happy to tell you. Not only that, but they actually encourage you to try different flavors. At other ice cream parlors, you usually get the impatient looks and frustrated sighs, but at Graeter's you just don't get that. \n\nWith all that being said, I haven't even mentioned the product yet. So far, there hasn't been a flavor I didn't like, but my top recommendation is a waffle cone with a scoop of black raspberry chocolate chip and a scoop of mocha chocolate chip. Enjoy!",

The workers are always friendly and usually students. Accepts XCash for XU students and also has UberEATS pick up and coupons. They always have the flavors of the month right away. They're especially friendly to my friend with a peanut allergy and open a new tub with a clean spoon when she orders something. They don't have a Bakery case inside like some Graeter's but usually have some cookies. They have free calendars for the ice cream flavors of the month and are always in stock for the free rewards. They  can be expensive if you love cotton candy ice cream - which can't be bought in a pint  but they also do a lot of charity fundraiser and have the best decoration during the holidays.",

When we walked in, there was a younger girl making something for a customer while the woman that would help us was ringing him up at the register - up to this point no issues. She eventually came over to help us after a fairly long interaction with the gentleman at the register. We were finally greeted. We asked to try a new flavor, and she continued to serve everyone else that had trickled in behind us. We actually had to TAKE our turn from her before she gave it away - weird, but still not a big deal, just rather inefficient and a little irritating. I asked for a single scoop and my wife got a \"kids\" scoop. Mine was VERY small. My wife's kids scoop was even smaller. The odd service and really small portions were not worth the $7.25 cost. This is the most convenient Greater's location to my home, but I may have to go elsewhere in the future.\n\nAs a side note: Greater's is a quality product. This review only reflects this experience.",
